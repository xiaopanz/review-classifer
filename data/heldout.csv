"January is always the worst month of the year for an avid moviegoer like thornhill. The studios are too busy promoting the wide releases of their Oscar hopefuls to concentrate on new films they have any hope for. As a result, January is a dumping ground for bad films they can't wait to write off. But Big Hollywood still hopes they can bilk an unsuspecting public out of a few million dollars before the release ends up in streaming and free cable hell.Because &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is a quote unquote romantic comedy and it is being released two weeks before Valentine's Day, I held out some hope for it. That, and the fact Zac Efron seems to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance since leaving rehab &#8211; he is in a lot films &#8211; seemed to indicate the film might be better.But &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is full of, well, awkward moments that were funny the first five times we saw the same jokes in other films and television shows. Now, one hundred times later, the jokes are boring and routine. These jokes are now so familiar they have been relegated to bad television sitcoms.Zac Efron and Miles Teller play Jason and Daniel, co workers and best friends, who meet regularly with Mikey (Michael P. Jordan, &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34;), a doctor who discovers his wife is cheating on him   to discuss girls, dating and their conquests. They talk about every part of their sexual conquests, their penises, their bodily functions, etc. They talk a lot about things I find it hard to believe three straight guys pursuing relationships with females would talk about.Eventually, they make a pact to stay single as long as Mikey is single. Given the predictability of THIS quote unquote romantic comedy, you already know what that means; one or more of the guys will immediately fall in love with a girl and try to hide it from the others. Strangely, the filmmakers views these relationships as an excuse for the three guys to get together and talk more. The story doesn't really shift to the new male female relationships. Essentially, this is a quote unquote romantic comedy about three guys.That might work, if the film were in better creative hands. Written and directed by Tom Gormicon, whose only other credit is &#34;Movie 43&#34; &#8211; the worst film I have ever seen &#8211; nothing in &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is original or seems remotely real or true. That's too bad because you get the sense the filmmakers are trying for so much more. Which makes &#34;Moment&#34; an even bigger disappointment.And it's too bad for Zac Efron who is a really handsome, really terrible actor &#8211; he has the looks of a matinee idol but he just can't act. When he works with more talented directors, he does a better job. But in &#34;Moment&#34;, his character just seems like a jerk, the whole time, and never really changes.Miles Teller is basically the comic relief and Michael P. Jordan plays the 'real' member of the trio. He is going through a real life situation. But they don't, or can't, overcome the clich&eacute;d story, bad direction and stilted acting of the lead.Imogen Poots plays Ellie, the object of Jason's affections. She must be the next &#34;It&#34; girl, because she is in a lot of movies coming out this year. She doesn't earn that title with this performance. She is good, OK, acceptable, but because she has to play against Efron, her performance fails to register.&#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is bad. And it will surely end up on a lot of &#34;Worst of 2014&#34; lists.",That BAD Moment,1394582400,"03 12, 2014"

"Season 3 of Being Human (US) is my favorite and hits its pace as a show with a fully developed set of characters and story line.  With 13 episode seasons, character development has become a part of jumping on in on a moving story for all shows in which we have 13 episodes to know the characters, like dislike them, and get vested in the story.  It took me a while but by season 3 I've settled into the mix of odd characters trying to live normal lives even though they are far from it.  They have solidified as a cast of characters that have bonded through joining together to help each out enough now that the them against the world theme sticks and allows for more humor to slip in as they get caught in some situations that could only be funny in the context of this show.  At this point I am hooked and am pulling for each of the characters and enjoy the show in how each supports each other in a unique way as they fail their way to figuring out how to make the odd situation they have put themselves in work.  It doesn't really, but that is what makes it interesting as they struggle through their attempts to be normal though they are far from it.  It took a while for it to all come together but season 3 achieves what was attempted all along as this group of misfit friends figure out how to live in the world and somehow get by even though they miss work half the time and are constantly pulling each other out of unique problems only a this group of monsters could be in.  Unique entertainment in an area of with a lot of competition but none like Being Human achieves!",Season 3 Being Human hits its stride,1404950400,"07 10, 2014"
"As a viewer, I personally feel I can only asked to suspend disbelief through so many layers of the narrative.  I&#8217;m OK with quirky characters.  I&#8217;m OK with pretentious teenagers.  I&#8217;m OK with movie families that don&#8217;t quite seem grounded in reality but are &#8216;close enough&#8217; for purposes of the story.  But when you fold something like full blown dementia into the tale I tend to draw a line.  It isn&#8217;t because I don&#8217;t like stories that explore a curious mental state; I find them fascinating.  Rather, I believe these tales need a very strong grounding in honesty for them to be relatable; if they&#8217;re not, then it all falls down like a cheaply built house of cards.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Emanuel (played by a comely Kaya Scodelario) is hardly your ordinary teenager.  Her mother died giving birth to her, and that grim reality has colored how she sees the greater world at large.  At work as a clerk in the town drug store, she&#8217;s smitten with the idea of constantly antagonizing her colleagues; and, at home, she&#8217;s always doing the same to her father (Alfred Molina) and stepmother (Frances O&#8217;Connor).  However, a mysterious new neighbor named Linda (Jessica Biel) suddenly presents her with an unusual opportunity to confront the questions of her own quirky mental state while perhaps helping to save the woman from a devastating future.I couldn&#8217;t begin to recount all of the problems I had with THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL in any concise fashion, but I will say this: writer director Francesca Gregorini did an impressive job chucking everything put the kitchen sink in here.  (Oh, yeah: there WAS a scene with the kitchen sink!)  There are many film influences at work here.  There&#8217;s also a willingness to discuss some very uncomfortable subjects like sanity and post partum depression.  Still, despite the overabundance of psychological moodiness, TRUTH feels surprisingly empty.  Its stylish visuals only add up to a revelation that doesn&#8217;t so much involve Emanuel as it does Linda.  Liking the characters but hating their predicament as much as I did was the only reason I hung with this thing for its largely uneventful 96 minutes.As best as I can surmise, it would seem that Gregorini believes in a world wherein two wrongs make a right.  Both of these lead women &#8211; Scodelario and Biel &#8211; are mentally troubled, far more than one jazzumes is the norm; but, together, they&#8217;re destined for a cure.  For the life of me, I can&#8217;t see how two mentally askew women (of this magnitude) is supposed to come up with a single sane mind, but I think that&#8217;s what the final scene intended audiences to take away from this.  My experience in reality has been that two misfits holed up together generally is not a good practice, but, then again, I don&#8217;t live in the movies.  I just write about them.For the life of me I can&#8217;t quite figure out what the story meant to say about Linda&#8217;s character as an individual.  Was her choice of denying reality the right thing to do?  Why not?  It worked for her.  Isn&#8217;t that what message Emanuel delivers by helping her finally put it all to rest?  Why do that?  Linda wasn&#8217;t hurting anyone except herself, unlike Emanuel who wanted to constantly irk everyone around her.  Is there union somehow what&#8217;s meant to be, or is it merely a film&#8217;s conceit?Assuming that the director (who also produced, too) makes most if not all of the decisions involving a film&#8217;s many elements, Gregorini chose to have Biel portray Linda as a kinda sorta New Age flunky with strong hints of a femme fatale.  (???)  She gives the woman a devilishly mild sexual undercurrent that still confuses me.  She dresses Linda in some weird hippie stylings &#8211; well, so long as, say, Banana Republic gets into lounge hippie wear &#8211; and adorns her house with elegant, high end furnishings.  None of the pieces to this puzzle added up to me, nor did they fact that she apparently has been on the run for as long as she has been, so how was her personal story even probable much less possible?When I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m supposed to make of all of the individual pieces, then all I&#8217;m left with is the created whole &#8211; and the whole?  I just couldn&#8217;t believe nor accept its simple final message.  Without mincing words, I think the subject matter explored here was very important, very relevant.  It&#8217;s this particular story that just felt more than a bit lost on me.THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL (2013) is produced by MRB Productions, Pisces Rising Productions, Rooks Nest Entertainment, Producciones A Ciegas, Mott Street Pictures, and Votiv Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Well Go USA Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications, this is one smartly shot character film with some very high quality sights and sounds.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then you have a director&#8217;s interview, deleted scenes, the theatrical trailer, and perhaps the most painful and curiously inappropriate jazzortment of outtakes (less than a minute of them) to look forward to.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL is an oddity.  It gets my award for the best misnamed film of the year mostly because there&#8217;s hardly any truth about Emanuel served up here &#8211; nothing in her life history has changed that I can detect &#8230; except maybe the development of some Mutant Age powers that gives her personal yet possibly inaccurate insight into the psychological deficiencies of others &#8230; and, even then, it isn&#8217;t as if she can do much about it.  And what should we call her?  DementiaGal?  That just doesn&#8217;t sound right, not with this whole &#8216;War on Women&#8217; frenzy currently afflicting society.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of THE TRUTH ABOUT EMANUEL by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Post-partum Dementia,1395187200,"03 19, 2014"

"There were always some lingering questions about the quality of the water in the bottles and any thinking person has to wonder about all those plastic bottles going into the eco system, but this is the first time I was exposed to an organized, detailed look at the entire industry.This documentary explores how bottled water comes about as well as the packaging and the impact on the environment. Let me tell you, if half of this is true (and I suspect all of it is) there is absolutely nothing positive about bottled water. It's as though that industry gets something for free, gets it onto the market at an unbelievably low cost and sells it back to you at an unbelievably high profit. Then they brew you on the back end by fouling up the environment. Essentially, they are charging you big money (more than you're paying for gasoline) for an inferior grade of a product you can get for nearly free. Not to mention the added health risks involved from drinking from those plastic bottles.There are a few scenes where industry people are questioned on various matters and it even had me squirming. This is a horrible, horrible market in every aspect, and it is almost entirely unnecessary.I'm tapping out now. I'm going to get myself a stainless steel personal water bottle and grab my water from home.

This is an entertaining movie but certainly not a cljazzic.

The show is simply enjoyable to watch.  The writers have done a nice job of developing the characters each with distinctive traits that blend well together and the casting selections were well chosen. We like how it weaves the use of old school technology and. references to historical figures with futuristic fictional tech.  Kinda like running the starship enterprise from a cozy gadgety filled man caveish basement. It's a bit like Dr. Who in how it incorporates real history into fantastical plots.  It's not the history channel but it's not intended to be.  It's an enjoyable show with a comidic touch combined with scify drama that family members of all ages in our house enjoy watching.

"Oh, NBC... Why don't you ever learn? Who in the world working there is permanently stuck in 1997? What makes them think ANYONE wants to watch crap like this??? Okay, sure. I'm sure some people out there loved the late 90's and its cliched sitcoms.Hell, CBS has an entire block of terrible, outdated sitcoms. ""Two and a Half Men,"" to ""The Big Bang Theory."" Crappy, terrible Chuck Lorre shows that only appeal to the lowest common denominator of ""comedy."" This is what NBC hopes to duplicate for some unknown reason, but they always fail miserably. Especially when they put out crap like this, ""Welcome to the Family,"" and ""Ironside."" Remember last year's ""The New Normal"" and ""Animal Practice?""

If I can save one person from watching crap like this, it'll be worth it.Maybe if you're over 45 and long for the cheesy sitcoms of the mid to late 90's, you'll enjoy this.

"I discovered this series quite by accident. Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary: Place of Execution, I was keen to read the novel (which inspired the TV adaptation) by Val McDermid. The novel was very well written, and a nail biting suspense thriller. Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well, and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan (Hermione Norris). She is jazzisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill (Robson Green), a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers, studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals. His methods may seem strange at times, but he always manages to get results. Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair, with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence, and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the ""cozy"" mysteries such as the long running Midsomer Murders   Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries, Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart. The crimes are horrific, sometimes involving children, almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals. The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling. Though compelling, this is not really a show to watch in one sitting, and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories, each divided into two episodes:The Mermaids Singing   Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising   The skeletal remains of a young woman is found, and when further evidence turns up, DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands, one with a penchant for dark haired young women.Justice Painted Blind   Another unsettling case, this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case. A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty. This throws up a whole bunch of suspects, including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent, and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals. The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan, all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One. There were no glitches on the other episodes. The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me.",I purchased the series via streaming and loved it!,1318291200,"10 11, 2011"

"This show is about as phony as any ghost hunting show. First, Brad Meltzer. Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math? The onset of the stories sounds interesting that Brad gives in the set up. The problem is that Brad does nothing!! He sits in front of a green screen and does no investigation himself. He has this team of ""experts"" who are totally laughable go out and ""discover"" the truth. One guy is writing notes the whole time (scribble scribble). The chick usually has nothing to do. The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation, they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began. So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy. I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not. In the end, there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up, even before the so called investigations occur. There is no real inquiry, its just published information. As the case with Lewis, clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published. In fact, they go and talk to an author and gets lots of ""yes's"".The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors. Lots of flashy editing, zoom cuts, sound effects, and incidental music to create the effect. Brad chimes in saying nothing important, but usually either retelling what has happened, or foretelling what his ""experts"" will find out. So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode. I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere. I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field. But like Dan Brown   they are fiction. No matter how real the facts are by themselves, they are linked by fiction.The show has one philosophy: ""Proverbs for Paranoids #4: If you keep them asking the wrong questions, it does not matter what the answer is.""",So Bogus,1342224000,"07 14, 2012"

"First, get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble.  Or use subtitles.  I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy. Because that's pretty much what the writers did.  Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess. Or they were channeling ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"".  There is nothing coherent about this movie.  It simply makes no sense.  You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan, but the bottom line is that it's just a bad movie.  It's billed as the number one horror movie of the year. Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck. Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap.  Oh, it was gory and bloody alright.  But horrifying?  I'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying, but not this.  Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie.

"This is one of those rare movies that I knew nothing about going in and frankly not much coming out.  The film opens with a sinister stranger named Richie (a scene chewing Samuel L.

One nit to pick is that Richie's GTO appears to have an automatic transmission, so there is no clutch to ""pop.""  I digress.Somehow, Richie gets John to go with him after John's leg is injured.  This might be something expected in some teen horror movie but what kind of idiot is middle aged John?  Now I'm still trying to figure out if this is some dark comedy, a horror film or just a by the numbers psycho thriller.  Richie and John travel the area, with several diversions by Richie that result in numerous deaths including at least one kid.  John's wife Joanie (Leslie Bibb) becomes involved after the murders are linked to her morose husband.

"Venture Bros. is the Simpsons of adult comedy. It was very good at the beginning, got you into it and then stopped being funny but is not heinously awful so you still watch it. I notice that most Venture Bros. reviews are from hard core fans who really get into the cartooniness of the series    which is exactly my problem with it. The special episodes are nothing but the cartoon part of Venture Bros. The only reason Venture Bros. is an adult comedy is because the characters cuss and once in awhile an episode will delve into rankly perverse sex that is never funny.

The main characters are unique, and though the secondary characters aren't quite as well drawn they still provide a lot of good moments. ""Man"" is played by Jason Ritter. He works at a video store and sleeps in his car. It also appears he has had an addiction problem in his past. He somehow takes a liking to one of the store's female customers (played by the writer director Marianna Palka) who only rents soft core porn for purposes of masturbation. He keeps coming on to her at her apartment and manages to make it to the point where he is staying there.He seems to be a genuinely sweet soul who keeps trying to draw her out. He cleans up her place, cooks for her and tries to introduce her to new things. Somehow she seems to enjoy the fact that there is another human being near her, but that's as far as it goes. He cannot get closer to her than her letting him wash her hair. No kissy, no touchie. She constantly yells at him and insults him. He hangs in there though and we're not certain why. What does he see in her? Does he see himself as being able to save her? Can she be saved and is she even worth saving?What makes this work are the two leads and the odd story and dialogue they get to chew on. I kept wondering what happened to this girl in her past that she ended up like this. How is it she lives in this nice and nicely appointed apartment without having a job?

"Have you ever had one of those experiences where you were watching two pretty solid performances but you wished they had been brought together in a different film?  Undoubtedly you have (I'd guess all of us who've watched plenty of movies have had that singular experience).  Unfortunately, that's really all I'd have to say superficially about WELCOME TO THE PUNCH   I've been no big fan of James McAvoy, though I've always liked Mark Strong's work, and here the two give a great one two bang bang performance of a cop and the felon on the lamb who are forced into some dire straights that require them to unite against a common threat.  As unlikely partners, they have some terrific chemistry, and that's too bad since the story in this thriller stretches the bounds of believability too far for their teamwork to really amount to much.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Three years back, Jacob Sternwood (played with simmering restraint by Mark Strong) escaped with his team from a high stakes robbery only after wounding detective Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy) with a shot in the knee.  In present day, Sternwood's son is involved in a heist that goes horribly wrong, forcing the man to come out of hiding in order to provide aid to the boy.  Once Lewinsky realizes this might be his only chance to finally capture the crook and regain his struggling career, he convinces his lieutenant to jazzign him and his new partner, Sarah Hawks (Andrea Riseborough), to the case.As often happens with police procedurals with an international setting, things are not quite what they seem.  What first appears to be a routine shooting suddenly turns into a criminal conspiracy involving crooked cops and even dirtier politicians.  Once the stakes are raised, Lewinsky is forced to accept Sternwood's begrudging jazzistance, and, together, they work to unmask the villains at the heart of this slick caper.Any who've followed my reviews know that I'm notoriously easy on films.  I only ask two things: (1) that they make sense, and (2) that they keep my interest.  For all the spit and polish, WELCOME TO THE PUNCH did the latter, but it kinda sorta fell apart with the former.Take the opening sequence.  Three years back, Sternwood and Lewinsky had their first confrontation, and writer director Eran Creevy opens his story in the middle of the high tech robbery without any explanation whatsoever.  (Never a great decision.)  On the streets below, four motorcycles are parked out in front of the skyscraper just waiting for the thieves to walk out and hop aboard, and they're off.  McAvoy's Lewinsky shows up in his car (against orders, I might add), and he pursues.  Suddenly, there's a jump cut, and the four motorcycles are parked in an alley; they've completely lost their police pursuer, and they're waiting to make another breakaway.  By an odd twist of circumstances, Lewinsky's car is useless, and he takes off after the motorcyclists ... on foot.  Despite their racing away at, easily, thirty miles an hour, he's somehow manages to get in front of them (???) and knock Sternwood off his bike so's they can have their first face to face.Seriously?The short sequence is so rife with errors it's laughable.  Sadly, there are parts of the film that make about as much sense (which is to say that they don't), and it's kinda sorta curious why no one seems to really make use of cell phones in this modern age story.  Everyone appears interested in only meeting face to face to exchange mostly expository dialogue, and one has to wonder if they've all bought into that whole `cell phones cause cancer' theory.  Also, Andrea Riseborough's character sports an accent so thick I practically needed sub titles to understand half of what she was saying.  Maybe that's me (I've been known to struggle with some accents), but, as much as I wanted to like her character and a few others that were sprinkled throughout, that's hard to do when you're trying to figure out what they're saying.Still, there's a great partnership at the heart of the flick that's worth watching.  It isn't as if I didn't enjoy PUNCH because I did like a lot of it.  I only ask that it made greater sense.  Perhaps if the director had let someone else take a pjazz at the script, maybe he would've been better served.  I firmly believe his audience would have.WELCOME TO THE PUNCH (2013) is produced by Worldview Entertainment, Between the Eyes, Automatik Entertainment, and Scott Free Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications?  Wow.  The film looks and sounds incredible, though there was one sequence shot inside an automobile where one actor's lines were curiously muffled by something.  Lastly, the disc boasts only a handful of special features, including a brief making of short, some talent interviews, and the theatrical trailer.RECOMMENDED.  WELCOME TO THE PUNCH is certainly slick photographed, fairly well staged, and nicely performed; yet, alas, it's entirely forgettable.  The script by writer director Eran Creevy tries too hard with too little substance to legitimately rise to the occasion.  At the end of it all, there's this great chemistry between its two leads   McAvoy and Strong   and there's this great narrative conceit which forces a cop and the criminal he's been hunting for three years to shackle all of their emotional baggage and work together for all of the right reasons; it's just too bad so little of it really made that much sense in the story department.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of WELCOME TO THE PUNCH by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",PUNCH's Great Chemistry Gets Watered Down With A Convoluted Story,1374451200,"07 22, 2013"

"Having a conversation about Bryan Fuller's exquisite television adaptation of HANNIBAL, it became clear that this was one of the only occasions we could think of where two separate performers had taken the same character and created iconic performances of that character. Anthony Hopkins has the scenery chewing in the films, and Mads Mikkelsen has his restrained, thoughful work on this show. And while the first season was gorgeous in its gore, amazing in its talent, superb in its writing, there was a restraint there because who could have thought that a show this mature and disturbing and intelligent would get a second season? Once they did, though, they must have thought there wouldn't be a third season, because they went for broke in this season, and it's breathtaking.The season opens with its most bravura mission statement yet: A fight, possibly to the death, between Lecter and Jack Crawford (still amazingly portrayed by Laurence Fishburne), signifying that Jack finally believes Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) that Hannibal is indeed The Chesapeake Ripper and not Will. Then, at a climactic moment of that fight, the show cuts to several weeks prior to that, beginning a countdown that has viewers on the edges of their seats until that moment actually happens. It's a startling way to begin the season, but it gives the entire show for the rest of the season a sense of urgency for the audience as we asked ourselves, ""When is this going to happen?"" But so many interesting, provocative and terrible things are happening in the interim as this climax builds that soon we find ourselves forgetting about what's to come, and give ourselves over completely to what's happening in the moment.If for some reason, any viewer thinks this idea seems like it wouldn't or shouldn't work, you'd be dead wrong.This season takes the ideas that were already turned on their heads from Fuller's adaptation of Thomas Harris' ""Red Dragon"" and turns them even further, which, like the wildly popular THE WALKING DEAD, works to the show's benefit because it leaves all sorts of room to deviate from the book. The main themes of this season are becoming and design. There has always been a duality between Will and Hannibal since the very first episode, but this season takes the duality even further into what the characters are becoming, usually by the design of Hannibal and to a much lesser extent by Will. As Will pushes Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas) farther away, he pushes her right into the arms of Hannibal. This is Hannibal's design. Freddie Lounds (Lara Jean Chorostecki) is becoming more and more of an interloper, and may have to be dealt with. This is Will's design. Dr. Chilton (Raul Esparza) is finding himself more and more prideful of his dealings with Will and then with Hannibal. This is Hannibal's design. Newcomer characters of the brother sister team of Mason and Margot Verger (Michael Pitt and Katherine Isabelle, respectively) both have designs of their own, but are ultimately part of Hannibal's design. The fate of Miriam Ljazz (Anna Chlumsky) is revealed and is VERY much of Hannibal's design. Hannibal's psychiatrist Bedelia Du Maurier (Gillian Anderson) is trying to help Will. All of these characters are becoming something, even Jack and his wife Bella (Fishburne's real life bride Gina Torres) are becoming products of Hannibal's design. Every time you think that Will might finally have the upper hand, Hannibal is always several steps ahead. And when we finally do get to the finale, every moment of shock is piled on top of another until you realize that you probably haven't breathed for several minutes.Under the very imaginative eye of Fuller, and with directors like Peter Medak, Tim Hunter, Guillermo Navarro and David Slade, this is easily the most visually arresting show on television. The composition, the lighting, the depth of focus; all of the intangibles that go into making a television show are all acting in perfect concert. The murders are more grand and more beautiful (which honestly, they really are, if you ignore how horrific they are). The scale of the show has grown, but the majority of all the scenes are either at FBI headquarters, Hannibal's home or office, Will's home and the Psychiatric Hospital, giving the show a very intimate quality.However good the performances by the supporting cast might be, and they're all pretty darn stunning, the show lives and dies with Mikkelsen and Dancy, who have become so adept at their verbal chess game and seem so comfortable with each other that their relationship seems totally organic, which is something most shows aren't capable of doing. For me, the real tragedy in their relationship is that Hannibal really does care about Will. He wants Will to choose to be his friend. There's an innate sadness within Hannibal that Mikkelsen is able to flesh out and for the first time in this character's history, he's not just likable; he's sympathetic, and that's a huge testament to their relationship in the show.This show really is a niche show, but it has been growing steadily in popularity because of how amazing the show is, signifying yet again that with shows like HANNIBAL, BREAKING BAD, TRUE DETECTIVE, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, LOUIE, JUSTIFIED, SHERLOCK, MASTERS OF SEX, HOMELAND and ORPHAN BLACK, we are living once again in a new television renaissance.

"As someone who has transgendered friends, I was hoping for something ground breaking, but came away disappointed.  I don't care how good an actor Jeffrey Tambor is, he makes a lousey woman.  There is nothing feminine about him.  I get it, it's supposed to be a comedy, but I find nothing humorous about men who suddenly discover at age 65 they are really a woman.  What have they been doing the last 65 years?  All of this was covered with much greater sensitivity in the movie 'Normal' starring Tom Wilkenson and Jessica Lange.Would love it if television would take a chance and create a show using a real transgendered actor playing a character that we can admire, that will help other trans people gain the respect of our society.  We don't need a show that merely propigates the stereotype about awful looking crossdressers.  Why not depict a young, trans person, that is actually feminine?  They're rare, but they do exist, and that's what makes them special.

"V H S (Adam Wingard et al., 2012)Everyone and their mothers has already weighed in on V H S, and they have all said the same thing: ""it's too darn long."" Add my voice to the chorus; this is a two hour movie that should have been 1:40 tops. Bloody disgusting's Brad Miska, who put the whole thing together, didn't feel the need (or have the know how, I'm not sure which) to cut this down to a length where it would have worked. That's a shame, because a number of talented directors turned in halfway decent work here, and some of it would have benefitted from a bit of trimming.First off, there's Adam Wingard's framing device, ""Tape 56."" This had the most egregious material; we could have easily lost half of the beginning segment without losing anything from the movie at all. The story involves a bunch of roustabouts who break into a house in order to steal a videotape; they find the owner dead and a whole lot of tapes, and have no idea which one they're supposed to grab, necessitating them watching a whole lot of them.Then comes ""Amateur Night"", directed by David Bruckner (The Signal). Given how much I enjoyed The Signal, I'm disappointed to report this is the weakest entry in the lot, lacking Bruckner's humor and insight; it could have easily found its way to the cutting room floor complete. Bruckner does good work, he just didn't do it here.""Second Honeymoon"" is the entry from Ti West (The House of the Devil), the most accomplished filmmaker of the bunch. And up until the final few minutes, this tale of a married couple being stalked by a mysterious figure on a roadtrip is the best of the bunch; unfortunately, the ""twist"" ending is just ludicrous. While the rest of the short is of Innkeepers quality, the ending is The Roost quality. And Ti West is a filmmaker who should never, ever go back and revisit his roots.Then comes Glenn McQuaid (I Sell the Dead)'s ""Tuesday the 17th"", in which a group of friends goes out to the woods to have a good time and finds themselves stalked by a seemingly otherworldly serial killer. It's not a bad concept, and it's not bad execution, though it's nowhere near as good as I Sell the Dead, McQuaid's sole feature length release to date. This is one where judicious editing could have helped, but given the rest of the segments here, this one comes off as middle of the road; it's not great, but it's not as bad as a few of these.Next, ""The Sick Thing that Happened to Emily When She Was Younger"", helmed by Joe Swanberg (the male lead in ""Second Honeymoon""); this is the one where it's most obvious a firmer hand in the cutting room would have been a great idea. Trimmed by even a few minutes, especially at the end, this would have easily been the movie's creepiest, most effective tale, about a girl who believes her apartment is haunted, told completely through Skype sessions with her husband, who's away on business. Excellent stuff that suffers from a lack of pacing throughout and a truly weak ending (had it stopped about three minutes before it does, it would have had much greater impact). Swanberg (Kissing on the Mouth) is a director with a great deal of potential, but like any director, he needs to get the right crew working with him, and he didn't have the right editor on this one.Finally, the four man team known as Radio Silence turn in ""10 31 98"", the best short here, about a group of friends who misread the address on an invitation and end up going to the wrong house indeed looking for a Halloween party. These guys did their own editorial work, and they did it very well; this is the best paced segment of the bunch by far (though it probably still could have lost a minute or two towards the beginning), tight, funny when it's supposed to be and tense the rest of the time. A little predictable once you get to the meat of the story, but the journey, not the destination, is the thing here.It certainly doesn't live up to all the hype, and I sincerely hope Miska, who is already wrapping up the sequel (S VHS), learned from the mistakes that were made with this one. On the other hand, it's not as bad as you've heard, if you ignore the hype and go into it with no expectations. It certainly could have been miles worse. ** ",So much potential...,1360281600,"02 8, 2013"

"As the camera slowly moves in on Danny brushing his teeth, there, on the left side of the wall is a sticker of Dopey from Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Later, after Danny is revealed by Toby some of the incidents that will occur at the Overlook Hotel, it would appear that the sticker is no longer there. The ""theorist"", by way of narration, explains that Danny is ""no longer a dope"". Yup, this theory and more abound in ROOM 237, a supposedly insightful, highly subjective, examination of Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.I was not really sure what to expect. Will I hear about symbolism? Hidden gestures by Kubrick to reveal the larger truth of the film? An explanation of the film itself and what some of the more mysterious moments meant? You will not be treated to any of these things that one might jazzume at face value. In fact, nothing that is ""revealed"" has anything to do with the movie. Apparently all of the theories relate to some outside dilemma that Kubrick (presumably) was grappling with and felt the need to embed these ideas in this film. Why that is the case no one answered.If anyone has seen the documentary Kubrick's Odyssey, they will well learn that Kubrick faked the moon landing for Nasa using the same effects as in 2001, and that, for keeping this a secret, he revealed clues laid out throughout the movie in this film. In ROOM 237, the same author retells much of that theory in this film so it might be redundant.Other theories regard its a film about the Holocaust, the genocide of the American Indians, or the mythological Minotaur. Or you just need to watch the film forward and backward simultaneously. All of these theories might be interesting on their own with no regard to content or context. Together they are just a mash of ideas with no thread in place. One even wonders if The Shining is a basis for their conclusions or if its just their own fanatical ideas being projected onto a very psychological playing field.It becomes clear that these 5 people who admire Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, know how to inspect the film and its intricate details, but do not seem to know how to watch a film. Or at least interpret properly the language of cinema. What they explain gives the view no insights into the film itself, nor of Stanley Kubrick. Beginning with the obvious, that Jack Nicholson's character slowly goes mad from isolation might be a good place to start to draw the viewer in their thinking. Instead we are slapped with obscure objects in the background that is faintly paid attention to by most casual viewers.Because of this, I cant help but feel that all these interpretations are complete non sense and have no place in a serious discussion of the film. The film is almost a joke and I wonder if the director is exploiting these people who seriously believe in their theories? It would be sad that Kubrick's film was used to make such a joke by the director. If he believes anything these theorists propose, then the director needs to revisit a book on symbology. I can't recommend this film, but I suspect ardent Kubrick fans will want to see it and understandably so. If that is the case, then it is not a terrible viewing.

"The bar for shows based around professional football hasn't been set very high. There really aren't many shows that made any lasting impression, let alone that were any good. Sadly, &#34;The Rebels&#34; doesn't even clear the low expectations. The first issue is that, once again, we have a football show that seems to be written by people who know nothing about football. Or who, at least, don't care to make the show seem remotely realistic. Now, I know that I shouldn't be expecting realism from a show with a coked out monkey with a gun but the football stuff wasn't funny either.

"As with all episodes in this increasingly silly series, a quick internet search reveals that there is no credibility to the claims of ""crystal skull enthusiasts"". The peddlers of this series do not give their audience much credit. They think we will not check them out. They are wrong.I do check them out and their production does not check out.The only reason to watch this episode is to see how biased and inaccurate these ""Ancient Aliens"" are. When you are done watching this episode you will be left with the ""Ancient Alien Enthusiasts"" conclusions that mystical crystal skulls of ancient origin have been found and are sizzling and popping with paranormal powers and that the mother of them all is the ""Skull of Doom"".Here are the true facts that were easily available and well known to all of the writers, producers and commentators of this program are NEVER presented in this program. These facts were unearthed by a legitimate set of producers, writers and commentators at National Geographic who aired a well documented legitimate documentary two years before this illegitimate and completely undocumented nonsense was put together by the ""Ancient Alien Enthusiasts"".The National Geographic documentary is called ""The Truth Behind: The Crystal Skulls"" and it completely debunks the nonsense of crystal skulls. Crystal skulls have been conclusively proven not to be ancient. The first crystal skull every produced was manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century. Crystal skulls are not something ancient people had anything to do with. They are irrefutably not of any paranormal origin and they certainly have nothing to do with extraterrestrial beings which of course don't exist except in the imaginations of people with hairdo challenges.Crystal skulls were never created by ancient people for any reason at any time in any part of the world.The purported origin of the most famous crystal skull peddled as the ""Skull of Doom"" and officially known as the Mitchell Hedges Skull is a 100% pure fabricated hoax. But the little old lady peddling the hoax seemed utterly believable. Even some of the best legitimate scientists were unable to summarily dismiss the little old lady's story.The skull was the icon of Arthur C. Clarke's Mysterious [X] series and is shown on the opening screen of each episode. If the little old lady piqued the interest of the totally legitimate scientist Arthur C. Clarke (who did not know the facts of it's fraudulent origins and only presented what was known at the time) there is reason to investigate the story in a serious way.It was difficult to do hard probing when the hoaxer was a very believable cute little old lady named Anna Mitchell Hedges who seemed so instantly reliable that on first meeting her you'd trust her to babysit your kids without any further references.But she was an absolute fraud! Whether deluded or wickedly deceptive, and in possible collusion with her father, she fabricated a fantastically believable story of how she acquired the crystal skull by seeing a glimmer in the depth of some Mayan ruins in Belize on her 17th birthday (a detail she always included in telling the story which I thought a bit unusual; you'd expect to find her leaving out the birthday detail once in awhile but she never failed to mention it).We now know she never visited the site of the excavation in which she claims to have found the skull. Another clue that something was amiss is that she always mispronounces excavation as ""escavation""in interviews. This always made me wonder about her and her father's actual level of training which we now know was nonexistent. Her father was nothing more than an exotic traveler who had no professional training in any field even remotely related to archaeology.The truth is her father bought the skull at auction and the records of the sale exist to confirm it. The skull was made by a European sculptor who used a European person's skull as the model. Anna Mitchell Hedges was either delusional or deceptive as was her father. Although her father seems to have held back on perpetuating the hoax, he did include a false reference to the skull as being Mayan in his first autobiography but removes the reference in subsequent editions. And he did not peddle the lie about the skull being an ancient Mayan artifact found in Belize unlike his cunning delusional daughter did her whole life.My personal opinion based on Anna Mitchell Hedges obsession with stating that she found the crystal skull on her birthday is that her father gave the skull to her as a birthday present. And he did not just give it to her but planted it in some genuine ruins that Anna Mitchell Hedges had to actually dig through and so she got to feel the thrill of finding an ancient artifact which she also mentions each and every time she tells the story.The ""ruins"" were known by Anna Mitchell Hedges not to be in Belize and the skull was known not to be a genuine ancient origin. But Anna Mitchell Hedges wanted the story to be true and so she embellished it and elaborated a bit more each time she told it. Every other so called mystic crystal skull has an equally faulty story behind its origin and paranormal properties.None of the above facts are presented in this episode and remember: all of the above facts were readily and easily available to anyone with an internet connection at the time they produced this utterly valueless episode of ""Ancient Alien Whatever"".What a waste of time this lowest quality program has become.",Not worth watching - except to see how facts are not presented.,1389657600,"01 14, 2014"
"I was snowed in one afternoon and rather than do anything productive I elected to watch this film.  To my surprise it held my attention and I confess that I rather enjoyed it.  The story is interesting    how lives connect and there are lots of great locations: Paris, Vienna, London, the Denver airport in a snowstorm. Many languages are spoken and a certain amount of skin is shown.  People fall in love and leave and switch partners, quit jobs and get fired.  An Imman and a psychiatrist are consulted as well as a call girl.  There's a Russian gangster too   something for almost everyone.  If I sound condescending I have to admit that I sat through the Whole Thing and if I were really honest I'd probably give it four stars.  But I won't because I don't really want to give shoppers the idea that this is a better film than it is.The cast is great, though and there are a few genuinely moving moments in the segment with Anthony Hopkins as a man searching for his missing daughter.  Jude Law is always exquisite and the rest of the cast is very good.  If you don't expect high art or you're snowed in you might enjoy this film.","Fun, trashy way to fill two hours",1357862400,"01 11, 2013"

"I remember being so psyched during the entire first season of HEROES, and yet we all know how it went downhill after that first season (I still blame the writers' strike). I didn't have that same level of excitement when watching the first few episodes of ALPHAS, and maybe it's partly a case of fool me once... ALPHAS doesn't present as intriguing or sweeping a mythology as HEROES, or as sprawling a cast. It lacked that sense of grandeur. Still, ALPHAS makes for decent viewing for comic book fans like me. After the dismal showings of NO ORDINARY FAMILY and THE CAPE, I'm just glad the networks are still throwing superhero televison a bone.If you're down with the X MEN comics, then nothing in ALPHAS will throw you for a loop. There's a creaky familiarity to ALPHAS, with X MEN having done it first and better. Instead of ""muties,"" the mistrusted super powered contingent in this world are labeled ""alphas."" In Season One, our point of view character is Cameron Hicks (generic handsome hunk Warren Christie), a grocery clerk who'd served time in the military. Hicks boasts unerring marksmanship coupled with unnatural grace and athleticism, except that Hicks tends to buckle under pressure and so is unable to consistently perform up to his potential. Still, when he becomes a suspect in an implausible fatal shooting, it doesn't take too long before he's recruited by the government sanctioned team of alphas dedicated to solving alpha related crimes.Part of my ""meh"" attitude springs from the overall blandness of the characters, even though they do exhibit an array of interesting abilities. There's an FBI guy (Malik Yoba) who can, at will, trigger his endocrinal ""fight or flight"" response, endowing him with temporary strength and durability, except that his channeling of this talent has a detrimental affect on his health. Britisher Ryan Cartwright, who last we saw had a dramatic death scene in BONES, plays an autistic young technopath, meaning he can manipulate the electromagnetic field, enabling him to access even the most restricted of computer databases. There's a morally challenged ""pusher"" (Laura Mennell) who bends people to her will once eye contact is made. To me, the most interesting role falls to Azita Ghanizada. She plays a fragile woman who can heighten any of her senses, although when she uses her ability, she tunes everything else out, rendering her easy to sneak up on. Not surprisingly, she's an exceptional crime scene investigator. David Strathairn has the thankless Professor X role, the on the surface wise and benevolent head of the alphas task force. But, as episodes unfold, we learn that Strathairn's character harbors sneaky shades of gray. I do like that all these characters present feet of clay. They all exhibit some type of flaw, and that helps to sustain interest. I only wish they were even more interesting. Strathairn's role is borderline unlikable. Warren Christie as the prohibitive male lead is vanilla.Because I like superhero stories in general, I did have fun watching Season One. But it's no breath of fresh air, no game changer. I watch it on Cable On Demand, don't value it highly enough to DVR it. You see where the narrative is heading. The overarcing conflict plays out in familiar ways. The episodes give you just enough steak but not enough sizzle. I did like the moral ambiguity exhibited with regards to the protagonists' choices and actions. Our alphas gradually come to suspect that they may be acting in concert with the wrong side, what with the government seemingly harboring a nasty agenda concerning detained alphas. And, really, what's a thriller show without an ongoing conspiracy? I perked up a lot when the fifth episode, ""Never Let Me Go,"" swung around and featured Dr. Vanessa Calder (Lindsay Wagner). Dr. Calder's appearance plants ALPHAS squarely in the same universe as EUREKA and WAREHOUSE 13. With EUREKA now canceled, there better be a spate of ALPHAS WAREHOUSE 13 crossovers. 3 out of 5 stars for ALPHAS Season One. Thankfully, in Season 2, the storytelling is even stronger.

"When &#34;Under the Dome&#34; premiered in the summer of 2013, I was excited as anyone to see Stephen King's novel come to life.  That excitement seemed to have payed off, as the few first episodes were mind boggling in terms of visuals and atmosphere.  Simply put, the show looked like a real winner.Sadly, I don't know if I've ever seen a show take such a nose dive.  For the last half of Season One and so far into this Second Season, the quality of the plots characters has descended into an absolute mess.  I usually don't like to review an &#34;unfinished product&#34;, so to speak, but I became so frustrated with this show that I had to cut ties.  The other night, I sat down to watch the third episode of this second season.  About 15 minutes in, I thought to myself &#34;why am I watching anymore?&#34;.  It had become a chore, and that's when I know it is time to hang it up.Basically, I think what happened to this show is that it made the decision to stray from King's novel.  Had they just done a 10 15 episode mini series and stuck to the events King penned, this show might have really worked.  As it is now, though, they are just treading water (and, I would argue, barely staying afloat) and wasting time.  The characters are going nowhere, each episode does very little to resolve (or sometimes even reference) the dome mystery, and let's face it...acting was never a strong suit of &#34;Under The Dome&#34;.It pains me to say, as I had such high hopes and excitement for this show, but it is a mess right now.  Until the show creators make the decision to narrow the focus and actually start focusing on real issues (not just a &#34;story of the week&#34;) approach, it will continue to flounder.  I have a feeling, though, that the viewing public will not stick around longer enough to give them that opportunity.",Time To Jump Ship,1405555200,"07 17, 2014"
"The past several years have witnessed multiple science fiction movies come out based on a great premise, with top notch special effects and acting to boot, but come up short due to the script.  I would cljazzify this movie as one of these.  The premise is simple, a group of international astronauts are traveling on a spaceship to Europa, moon of Jupiter, to look for life under its frozen ice surface.  Over the course of the mission, both before and after finding life, they suffer various accidents and episodes of bad judgement that lead to their deaths.  The movie's plot of going to Europa to find life is intriguing and original.  The background of story as laid out in flashbacks in the movie are all quite plausible.  However, the movie fails by the very nature of all the accidents that plague the crew.  Everything from the ice cracking under the feet of our intrepid explorers, to hazardous chemicals spraying onto their space suits, it seems this mission was plagued from the start with one mishap or another.  And so the film came out feeling contrived.  Hence the 3 5 stars.","Very original retelling of a common story, however the film deserved better editing of the screenplay.",1384732800,"11 18, 2013"

This movie isn't terrible and the acting is good, Kris Kristofferson is really great in this, but honestly nothing happens. It's a lot of repetition between the three aspects of Franks life.

"I am a social worker and counselor who specializes in family violence and also case manager for adults at risk. I have been watching all the seasons of this fascinating show. What interests me in particular is how the therapists interact, establish trust, and help the 'hoarder' work through this disorder in a remarkable non judgmental way. It is also very interesting to hear the 'hoarder's rationale for keeping things, and the loss and trauma that triggered them to start hoarding. In most of the episodes, I don't know how Matt, Dorothy, and Cory can deal patiently with these very determined and deluded people...most of them so angry and abusive when they sense the loss of control when their hoard is being disposed of, they seem very hard and resistant to work with and help. I have watched almost all of the seasons, but this one in particular featured 'hoarders' who were very mentally ill, in my professional opinion. This really makes me wonder how their aftercare went, and if it was successful. I like that the show doesn't always have a happy ending.

"I usually wait a while to watch a new series until I know whether it's been renewed or cancelled.  This was cancelled yesterday, May 9th (along with my favorite sitcom Community).  I watched quite a few episodes, and it's bad.  Even by JJ Abrams standards, though it's not as bad as Revolution.The plot is as follows:  The girl (Bo) has psychic abilities off the charts and she was 'rescued' from a government project that may have been trying to develop her as a weapon.  Bo's ""rescuers"" reunite her with her dad, who was on death row.  The reason he was on death row was completely resolved half a dozen episodes later.  The evil director of the facility that was studying Bo wants her back and they enlist the FBI   the sole presence of which is a youngish brunette in a pony tail.  That's the back story.In nearly every episode:1.  Their safe house gets compromised and they have to flee2.  Bo gets a vision about a normal person who needs help.  She tugs and tugs on her father's arm until he gives in.. reluctantly.3.  The 'bad guys' enlist a psychic to find her or turn on a psychic machine that reads psychic emissions (wtf?)4.  Bo and her dad hug the people they save5.  The bad guys are shown to have another ace up their sleeveThey state at the onset that Bo needs a normal childhood because she is so powerful she could bring peace to the world.  However, nobody shows a trace of growth.  Every person's personality is completely fixed and no experience changes anyone, even slightly.JJ Abrams isn't even trying anymore.  He comes up with a plot (this time shamelessly ripped off from Touch), and cranks out a dozen poorly thought out episodes before being handed another series (and the reins to both Star Trek and Star Wars).  When I see JJ Abrams name on a series, I know I'm getting a polished turd.

"Four  or is it five?  young libido cases who enjoy filming themselves committing various criminal acts are hired to break into a house where they discover an apparently dead body and a slew of old VHS tapes, each of which portrays acts that beat them at their own game. The important thing to remember is that each of the apparently unrelated, gory, disturbing, and largely supernatural episodes in the middle portions of ""V H S"" represents a separate VHS discovered by the characters at the beginning; i.e., this film utilizes the same ""frame story"" (little stories within a larger story) technique that was first used by Boccaccio and Chaucer and that has been used in a host of works ever since.The sad thing is, the premise for ""V H S"" has real potential; unfortunately, it's largely ruined by the standard ""found footage"" cinematography. While I understand that the purpose of this is to add realism, ""V H S"" would be a much easier, less confusing view without the shaky camcorder that keeps zooming in on the floor or some drunken person's face. Another frustrating point is that the main ""envelope"" story is maddeningly incomplete. This film is honestly fascinating in places, but it requires a LOT of patience.Other Considerations:  Good dialogue, even though much of it's from characters who can't complete a sentence without at least one f bomb and one ""dude!""

You see, the storyline makes you wonder which woman YOU'D choose  the one who's slightly less attractive but totally loyal and polite, or the slightly more attractive one with constant personal issues that never seem to stop being an obvious distraction.  I'd choose the loyal one myself.  It's a no brainer.Anyway, the actual plotline is so incredibly *slow* that the film almost put me to sleep on a few different occasions.  However this is perhaps because it's totally stuck in romance, which is definitely NOT right up my alley, haha.Still, it's a pjazzable film that serves as a nice way to pjazz the time on a rainy night with nothing better to do.

"When you take a step back and look at the premise of this series, it's more than a bit insane. Given that, once you drink that Kool Aid it works. They play it pretty well.Here's the scoop. Ryan Hardy (Kevin Bacon), ex FBI, is asked by the bureau to help in murder investigations that seem to be related to Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) a serial killer that Hardy collared years earlier. The investigation points to a large group of acolytes under Carroll's spell. Can Hardy round these people up.On the bad side is the premise. It's difficult to maintain a cult if the chief dude is in prison, even with the tight network these folks have in place. It simply isn't believable. Also, Carroll's plan is so far reaching, and so detailed, it has to fail because you're dealing with human beings, and even the slightest miscalculation can throw things off. I also had a problem with this many people being so bloodthirsty. The body count is way too high.On the good side you have some good characters and some good actors playing them. And the paranoia machine is cranked up because you don't know who is and who isn't in the cult. This leads to some nifty plot turns.It's written well enough and directed well enough.

"""You're just impatient! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn't like this movie, I'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!""These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West's slow burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera    he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots    but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don't watch movies for atmosphere. That's why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn't it scary? Nope. Two twenty somethings    Claire and Luke    are the only staff members at the soon to close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It's a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has ""reverse deja vu"" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written ""chills"").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren't sure what's supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire's mopey mugging.I'm certain it's meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny    a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward!    but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won't tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don't know it's there, it's almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that's the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you're focused too much on the background stuff (like West's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes).

"Great story idea.  Great ensemble of actors.  Terrible script, editing, WAY of telling the story.  Puts one to sleep, no identification with the characters, no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic BBC pauses with the meaningful looks.  Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X (really, any of the 'Ian' actors we all know and love), can hold the viewer's interest, during long Brit like pregnant pauses and silences, which alike baffle the average audience.  Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film, need something more;  they need LINES, or at least meaningful blocking.  Since these long pauses and silences don't seem to add to the plot at all, and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters, one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline.  Yeah, but if you're watching paint dry for most of each episode, the sophistication doesn't 'pay off'.  We don't need car chases and shoot em ups, we need MORE LINES.  Shakespeare knew that.  So why didn't the script writer, here?  Who messed up this good story?So I forced myself to get through the series.  So I don't wonder why AMC pulled the plug.  It's bad scripting and bad film editing; not the acting, and not the plot.  WAY TOO SLOW, people.  WAY TOO LACKING in lines, subplots unexplored, so of course the viewer will be bored.  Were I a potential commercial sponsor, I wouldn't want my commercials playing during this show, due to its snoozy presentation.  Not fair to the actors or the plot, either.  A story which needs to be explored (whether plausible or not)    just got wasted.

"Me thinks thou dost protest to much. Less is more. Your pen is bigger than your ideas. these are all the things I would say to the the obviously talented creative team of this show. A refreshing premise, well written dialogue,  Well acted and directed. All that and high marks for production values. So, why not five stars? You pushed a little too hard, tried to tell to much, show too much. As every professional actor knows when you are given three minuets to do a monologue, don't try to fit five minuets worth of material into three. Do two really fine simple minuets and leave them wanting more. In this, the best pilot of the season, they did just that. This pilot sacrificed quality for quantity. Not that what they did wasn't good it was like great sex without a climax, to put it terms that go along with the show. I get it though, they had so many good ideas they kept them all and just cut each one into a thumbnail of it's potential. At times it feels there are at least two directors in charge doing different scenes leading to an unevenness, ironically it lacked the dynamics of a well conducted symphony. Over all I liked this story, even if it is a bit heavy handed and overt in the obligatory cliche stereotypical  sex and drug references in every scene, over kill, they needed to trust our imaginations more. Less focus on the sex and drugs may have allowed more time to develop the characters. Great acting, direction and cinematography are the saving grace here. I to, hope this gets picked up and the creative team settles down to make this live up to the potential that screams to be accomplished.

"*****SPOILER ALERT: there may be a few spoilers ahead*****I've watched two episodes of ""The Bridge"" so far.  I think it is brilliantly written, the cast is top notch, and I am curious to find out where the story is going.  There is only one problem for me, and that is that I have no patience and no warm feelings toward the lead detective, Sonya, played by Diane Kruger.  I understand that she is supposed to be afflicted with Asperger's Syndrome, but to me, that does not explain her constant bizarre and inappropriate behavior.  One would jazzume that a detective would have learned, through years of experience, how to display at least a minimum amount of empathy and humanity when speaking to a man whose wife has just been murdered.  Nope....not this detective, apparently.  She undresses in the office, in front of her male supervisor.....who does that?  I don't know if it is the way Sonya is written, if it is poor acting, or a combination of both.  But I just can't stand her, and I cringe every time she opens her mouth.For these reasons, I am rating ""The Bridge"" only 3 stars, and I am not even sure if I want to continue watching.  I have never been able to enjoy a program when the lead character is completely unlikable.  I want to watch and see what will happen next, but I just wish the writers would do something to make Sonya more human and believable in her role.EDITED: I have updated my review to 5 stars after watching episodes 3 and 4.  I decided to give Sonya and ""The Bridge"" another chance, and I am very glad that I did.*****MORE SPOILERS AHEAD*****The plot keeps getting more interesting, and the suspense is heightened when a young woman is left to die in the desert, on camera.  Will the El Paso detectives and the FBI find her before it is too late?All of the supporting actors here are top notch.  Ted Levine and Annabeth Gish are especially strong and believable in their roles.  I am surprised by how much I enjoy Matthew Lillard as the sleazy reporter; he's such a jerk, but he cracks me up with some of his comments.Sonya Diane Kruger is beginning to soften a bit, which is what I was hoping for.  I don't have to necessarily ""like"" the character, but I just want to believe she is a real person, good or bad.  In the first two episodes, I wasn't buying Sonya at all, even as someone with Asperger's.  But in episode 3, she made me laugh (""We can't have sex here!""), and she was believable.  Finally, in episode 4, I felt her humanity.  When she was watching the video of the woman in the desert, you could see that she was genuinely concerned for her.  And when she was talking to Hank about her sister, that's when I could see Sonya as a believable, even vulnerable person.  Yes, she still has some quirks and flaws, like we all do, but she is not the strangely robotic person I saw in the first two episodes.I'm really impressed with this show, and very glad I decided to watch two more episodes.  Now I am officially HOOKED.  Diane Kruger is doing a good job in a difficult role.

"I started watching this show because Monica Raymund was in the cast and, after watching all three seasons of &#34;Lie to Me&#34;, I think she's among the most provocatively beautiful, talented, and fascinating actors I've ever seen, but after watching &#34;Chicago Fire&#34; for most of season 1, I've given up because, apart from Raymund's Gabriela Dawson, for me there simply are no characters in the series who are interesting, likeable, or possible to care about, and more than a few are just plain aggravating   especially Taylor Kinney as the obnoxious Kelly Severide with Jesse Spencer, late of &#34;House&#34;, a pretty close second. This is really just a nighttime soap with the &#34;drama&#34; of fires added to give it what juice it has and that really isn't much.

"I didn't give a better rating for this season because while some of the episodes were definitely 5 stars, there were too many from the season that just weren't that great. Also, I know the program is a dramedy and parts are supposed to be funny, but many of the characters in this season were just horrendously stereotyped and some of the written material is borderline racist, sexist, etc. I realize the Sue Sylvester character is supposed to be an obnoxious b*tch, but I just think some things she and other characters state can be done differently.I particularly was incensed when in Season 3 one of the characters used the phrase ""rice queen"" when referring to the Asian boy character and Sylvester constantly calling Santana ""Sandbags"" is very sexist, unless I am misunderstanding something here.Although Sue Sylvester seems to become more human and tolerant later in the season, I still think she can be portrayed as a b*tch and be funny WITHOUT all the stereotyping and comments her character makes.I realize the show is attempting to fight hate and bullying and support the rights of many, but I seem to get mixed messages from the show's writers. I certainly don't want the show censored or told what to do by any person or organization; it should appear the way the creators want it to appear.Maybe the whole point of Murphy and company pushing the envelope is to get people to think, but it is difficult at times to know when they are just trying to be funny cute and what times they are trying to be hateful and or stereotypical to make a point.",Very disappointed with quality and derogatory tone of program!,1352505600,"11 10, 2012"

Jennifer is a raven haired beauty that is smoldering hot and has a knack for wearing heels and short skirts even in the most inappropriate of places. Since IMHO, the show itself is not any better than the previous season, I have to believe that the additional + 100k viewers per episodes are all her!Maybe it is an optical illusion, though I swear that Callie was filmed this year at odd angles, which is generally a sign of pregnancy or weight gain? Then again, will all due respect to Kiele Sanchez (AKA Callie), there are solid reasons why you rarely see her in the same frame as Taylor Cole!Without giving away the ending and under the guise of full disclosure, I may have removed 1 2 star from my rating for the simple reason that Jim took a pjazz on an impjazzioned plea by Taylor Cole when she essentially offered herself up!In sum, an entertaining show that may have lost a step in season 3, I can only hope that Ms. Cole reappears in Season 4 or I don't know if I will be compelled to tune in.","Still good, though IMO slipped a notch.

"The countryside is gorgeous, Galway, Ireland what's not to like? The actors mostly up and coming, none of whom I recognized, the storyline, tried and true.A dad, calls his three children home, he has something he wants to talk about. Is he ill, is he in trouble, what is going on? The three children all return home, one with her husband and two children, one with his current girl in tow, and one all by himself. The secret it turns out is not too scary. And, all of the children bring secrets of their own. This is billed as a dysfunctional modern Irish family, but, in reality, it is a normal family coming together two years after the death of their mother.There are some fun times, lots of boring, nothing really said times, fair acting, but nothing in this film grabs you to really want to know more. The scenery is the best bet, and there is a lot to see. We visit pubs where everyone gets drunk, children's playground, cemetery, and scenes of the farm, which looks nice enough. Which does make me wonder how the dad all by himself kept the place looking so good.  When all is said and done there is no big family meeting to settle things, it seems it is all done in small groups, or by looks, but we are not privy to too much of the conversation.Really a film for Seinfeld fans, about nothing.Recommended For The Scenery.  prisrob 02 22 14","All About Nothing, Really",1393027200,"02 22, 2014"

"The premise was original but that's as far as it went. The plot was repetitive even for a comedy like this. You basically know the story and it's a thin one. It just seemed like the script could've had more story elements to it. For instance, Zack Efron gave the frat a big speech in the beginning and vowed to create a major college tradition that would become legend like beer pong. So I thought we'd see the frat trying out silly ideas which we didn't. Neighbors has some laughs, don't get me wrong, it just wasn't a homerun. Note, the wife drops the F Bomb like a drunken sailor, not really needed to me and it took her sweetness away. Looking back it's a forgettable comedy.

"When the new girl in school starts to come between Rebecca and her best friend, Lucy, she begins to suspect that there is something far more sinister behind their relationship. Rachel Klein's modern update on traditional Gothic storytelling is brought to life in Mary Harron's screen adaptation of THE MOTH DIARIES, from 2011. Rebecca and the other girls transpose their teenage anxieties like anorexia, depression, suicide, and sexuality on to their ghostly cljazzmate as a means of dealing with their internal struggles. While Ernessa may not be seen physically drawing the blood from her victims, her presence at the school certainly saps the other girls of their strength and happiness, leading them in to despair. The lesbianic undertones that are present in the plot also draw strongly from the cljazzic tale of Carmilla, which is frequently referenced throughout the girls' schoolwork. Harron takes a timely approach in developing the characters and mood of the picture, but unfortunately, her deliberate pacing begins to wear during the long periods of inaction and leaves the audience feeling deprived as the film draws to its anticlimactic ending. Still, we are left on a positive note, having grown with Rebecca as she overcomes her pain and loss to find a renewed strength in herself. THE MOTH DIARIES ultimately falls short of becoming a modern cljazzic, but it does provide another unique and emotionally charged vampire tale in the same vein as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.

Lack of Big Baddie, pacing has been off and the big thing this season, so far seems to be a carrier bag that dropped from the sky many years ago that was filled with cocaine.Raylan seemed to have his own episodes, Boyd his own and the two didn't cross.Boyd this season is portrayed much less ambiguously and more straight out do whatever needs to be done to help along his drug and other nefarious business.  Still some of the humor in the relationship of the two exists, but a lot of the complexity that they had given Boyd and that I had really enjoyed, seems to have evaporated.This one to my mind is on my &#34;critical care&#34; list, sticking with it in hopes that it's going to get it's act together, but the fun that I've had with it in the past just isn't there.Acting still good, I blame the scripts.",Justified in cruise control,1361145600,"02 18, 2013"

This movie could have been great if they had more production money. The actors probably took 80 % of the budget. They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that. Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive? Was this the end or the beginning of the end? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck(it bombed worldwide) without much substance? Was this a waste of 92 minutes? Tune in for the sequel.

"The quote above is sang by Tim to the son he took from the Used Toilet Paper store owner. Yeah, the movie is extremely bizarre. Tim & Eric spent $1 Billion to make a 3 minute movie and have to make that money back by reopening a destroyed mall, or else. Right off the bat, most people will either love this movie or hate it. I was stuck in the middle.First of all, be warned that this movie is very disgusting. In the first 15 minutes you'll experience full frontal male nudity (a piercing), dismemberment, vulgar language, and drug use. It gets worse from there. If you're fine with this, then you may ultimately be able to get through Tim & Eric. If you can't, then don't bother watching. The movie has plenty of funny jokes, although they do get repetitive; for example, the constant back and forth screaming arguing gets annoying after a while, but Will Ferrell's winking segment was hilarious so that's one exception. And some jokes aren't funny at all. It's immature comedy so don't go in expecting something sophisticated or you'll be truly disappointed. The scene where Tim inspects and takes Jeffery was probably my favorite and so were the scenes that involved them. The ending is over dramatic but hilarious as well. The biggest flaws are the long, drawn out jokes that aren't very funny.With plenty of guest appearances, Tim & Eric's Billion Dollar Movie was able to give me a few laughs and keep me interested to the end.

Jason (Zach Efron) is the more womanizing of the three, moving from casual relationship to casual relationship with ease. Daniel (Miles Teller) is his right hand man, another carefree male on the prowl aided by his female friend Chelsea (Mackenzie Davis). Lastly is Mikey (Michael B. Jordan), the only married one of the group who opens the film being told by his wife that she wants a divorce. Adding insult to injury the man she's been having an affair with is her lawyer.In a show of camaraderie the three young men pledge to remain single together. To celebrate their oath they head out to the usual watering hole with the intent of hooking up for a night of casual sex. Mikey goes along but still reeling from his news takes things slow. Daniel, with an jazzist from Chelsea, finds someone for the night. And Jason winds up with a lovely young lady named Ellie (Imogene Poots) and finds himself having a better night than expected but due to a misreading of clues thinks Ellie is a hooker.Things get a bit more complicated the next morning when Jason and Daniel (co workers for the art department at a publishing company) find that Ellie is the new representative for one of the book companies they deal with. Realizing his mistake, Jason apologizes and tries to make it up to Ellie. So much so that he soon finds himself falling in love with her in spite of the promise he made to his friend.But he's not alone. Daniel suddenly discovers that Chelsea just may be the perfect match for him as well. Their budding romance moves forward with the exception that he doesn't share it with his two friends. But neither does Mikey when he starts to get back together with his ex. All three seem to have found the perfect match at the exact wrong time.Of course in the world of movies this means that one or all three will eventually brew up the relationship and whether or not they straighten things out and end up together isn't revealed until the last few minutes of the film. Is it a happy ending? Watch to find out.The movie uses a tried and true cut out technique in the way it's written, a pattern that feels familiar to anyone who's seen a movie in the last 30 years. All the beats are there with very little new added with the exception of an overuse of the F bomb and a few uncomfortable sexual escapades that are discovered by various friends and family. I kept thinking this felt like just about every other movie about young couples in today's world and in the end that was kind of sad, not because it had been done before but because it made me wonder if this was what being single was all about in today's world. If so then it's a truly sad world out there with no hope for romance, connecting with someone or a sense of what is right or wrong.The acting by all casts members was actually pretty good here, much better than I expected. Standing out among them for me was Davis as Chelsea. Her approach to so many scenes is lighter than some of the rest and makes it more believable. While one would think this film is centered around Efron, which it is to some extent, it actually gives all the leads plenty of shared screen time which makes the story just a little more believable.Fans of Efron will certainly want to see this film, especially those who can't wait to get a glimpse of his bare behind (lots of press releases shared this photo). But the movie will also have the effect of boosting the careers of all involved. In the long run the film is forgettable at least and yet still a bit entertaining in the end. Will it hold up to repeated viewings? Doubtful. But it will offer a nice entertainment for adults.",AWKWARD IS AN APPROPRIATE TITLE,1403654400,"06 25, 2014"

I would love to see a show of hands as to how many adults think it's cute when you see a child slap an adult? This is one of the most extreme cases I've seen watching this program, but 80 percent of these 'parents'  allow back talk, snarky attitudes, tantrums, etc.  Not all, mind you, buy enough that should concern us. These are the 'entitled' ones who believe it all needs to be handed to them on a silver platter.  It makes me ill to see how catered these children are, how foolish the adults are.  I'm not sure who needs a spanking more the kids or some of the moms.On the other hand, some of these young ladies show fabulous poise, good manners, and upbringing.  I do think that pageants, when viewed and done correctly can benefit those involved.  Maybe they need to test the mothers for maturity levels before allowing their children to enter,I like watching the older kids more, but it's something only tolerable in small doses,  Watch at your own risk! lol","Season 4, Epi.6",1392854400,"02 20, 2014"

"I gave TKOJM for short a try and by not setting the bar to high I wasn't disappointed by what I saw.The movies takes 110 minutes to develop its characters, back story and guide the viewer through the stories evolution.It stars out giving the viewer a glimpse of Jacob's life as a young teen living with his parents at their secluded cabin ( where most of the movie is shot) in the woods. He seems to be somewhat of a normal teen who is displaying typical teen problems with his parents who would much rather play video games than talk of play work outside.He finds a freshly fallen meteorite while chopping firewood for his dad. I will leave his early days life's story there for obvious reasons and fast forward to the present.A group of five friends rent Jacob's childhood cabin from Bob (the new owner) who has been renovating the cabin and gave the gang a good deal since the renovations haven't been completed yet.The acting and dialogue were pretty good until all HE double LL breaks loose and the acting tanks by the entire cast as well as the dialogue. The direction was decent enough for the most part, but the scenes used to build tension and or add a little fear factor were much to obvious and poorly timed. The lighting and sound really needed some help.The kill scenes showed some promise, but again the timing, dialogue and very poor special effects makeup ruin any chance for creepiness or grossed out gore. Jacob's eyes just don't help to sell him as the monster he is. Bear in mind what Jacob came in contact with as a teen in the woods for the explanation for his eyes and his behavior I guess?There is a fare amount of cursing including the F...word and a few scenes of graphic violence with blood and gore. There wasn't any nudity or any sex scenes in the movie.In closing this movie isn't a total write off as the story did show some creativeness and the acting was decent until the chaos starts. The movie could have easily been shortened by 20 minutes or so and by doing so helped with the VERY long time span between the killings (40 to 45 minute time span) from his teen years to present. If the director would have cut the kill scenes just as the killer was??? instead for using the TERRIBLE special effects makeup props it would have been much more effective and creepy. 2+ stars.",THE LONG AND DRAWN OUT SLOW DEATH OF JACOB,1402012800,"06 6, 2014"
"I actually wanted to like this one, and I kind of did, at first. The story of a couple guys pushing their new, potentially revolutionary idea into the tech market was interesting. There were some funny parts, but not as much as I would have liked. I was enjoying this pilot half way through until I realized it's basically the merger of ""The Big Bang Theory,"" and ""The Social Network."" You got a group of hyper intelligent guys (Big Bang Theory) and they have an awesome idea that will probably make them millions, (Social Network). Even some of the characters are suspiciously similar.Realizing this, I just couldn't get back into the show. It feels like I'm being pandered to and I hate it. ""Hey! You know those things that are really popular right now? Let's imitate that!""I just wish some of these pilots would have taken a chance and do something different instead of retread ground.Despite my witching, I would probably watch one or two more episodes and hope that it will deviate from what we're already familiar with. But as it is, I'm pretty disappointed.","Basically ""Social Network"" the show",1366848000,"04 25, 2013"

"As with all reviews this is about both the qualty of the set and the show. If you disagree post a review as these reviews are designed to help fans who haven't purchased or seen the show make a decision NOT whether you agree or disagree (that's what the comments section is about). Moving on...Every season of every TV show has episodes that don't stand up to the best that has come before and after.The show looks very good. The extras include podcasts, deleted scenes a terrific extended episode of one of Ronald Moore's favorite episodes ""Unfinished Business"". There are also 2 episode commentary tracks in addition to the podcasts ported over from the web from the original broadcast. David Eick's video blogs are also included as well as the webisodes (which I never got around to watching so it is kind of cool having it here). I would appreciate more behind the scenes type of specials but I like that sort of stuff. Fans who just want the episodes will be pretty well served by its presentation here.This is another really good set. I am disappointed that we don't have a Blu ray version (yet) and I find it unlikely that Universal will be releasing this on HD DVD with the collapse of the HD DVD consortium. The show looks better than the standard definition broadcasts but not quite as sharp as the high definition. I'm looking forward to the fourth and final season of this terrific show. I'm also looking forward to Moore's future series (I am a bit disappointed with ""BG"" producer David Eick's update of ""The Bionic Woman"" which, while it has its moments can't even compare to ""BG"").PLOT SUMMARY AND SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW:  The third season has to my mind some of the best episodes of the series particularly during the episodes on New Caprica leading up to the deliverance from the Cylons. When we last saw the survivors of humanity they had settled on New Caprica. They were abandoned by the Galatica and Pegasus when multiple Cylon warships showed up in orbit because Adama (Edward James Olmos)and Lee (Jamie Bamber)felt that they weren't prepared to take them on. We get a healthy glimpse into the rigors and harshness of the Cylon occupation showing that, interestingly, they aren't any better or less flawed than their human captors.Saul(Michael Hogan)has started a resistence movement carrying out guerilla warfare against the Cylons to try and cause as much damage as possible in hopes of helping Adama on the ground when the Galatica returns to save them.From there the series deals with the fall out of settling on New Caprica in the first place, how humanity will deal with collaborators (it's one of the most riveting episodes of the season in my opinion), find out that the Galatica and the Cylons are on the right course for Earth and that there is a mysterious plague striking the Cylons. As with previous episodes the show deals with a number of ethical issues that other shows wouldn't (and couldn't) touch. I know that there are those that were disappointed with the 3rd season feeling it ran too long or that many of the stand alone episodes were weak but I would disagre; I felt that the quality was consistent with the first two seasons dealing with interesting and complex themes.",3rd season highlights are as good as previous episodes while some of the stand alone episodes don't quite hold up as well,1206057600,"03 21, 2008"

"Luke Wilson stars as John Felton, a real estate agent who can't catch a break. The housing addition he works and lives in has fallen on bad times with the housing crunch. Unable to get a loan, fired from his job, he comes home to be surprised by his wife and children only to lash out at them. They leave to visit the park and a knock at the door finds John facing Richie (Samuel Jackson).It seems Richie's car won't start and he needs a push. John obliges and then Richie asks him to go with him so he can repay him with a drink. The bar they end up in is familiar to John and he begins to feel a bit uncomfortable when finds the boss who just fired him at the bar. John takes the high road and backs away gracefully but Richie just doesn't see the world that way. He suggests John take on a bit of revenge. John declines.Also in the bar is a young woman named Tammy that John worked with at the real estate agency. Not only did he work with her, it comes out that he was having an affair with her, the main reason that his boss fired him. When Tammy's too drunk to drive, he and Richie give her a lift. This is where things begin to change.For whatever reason Richie is evil personified in one man. Anyone who does something to John, for instance the cell phone store clerk who won't allow him to make a phone call, suddenly ends up beaten to death, of course, after a visit from Richie. The three roll down the highway until John thinks he sees Richie for what he really is when he slaughters everyone in a quick stop gas station.In a situation where he has to worry about the Tammy as well as himself, John can't simply drift off alone. When Richie shoots a truck driver who nearly runs them off the road it seems that their fate is sealed. A stop at a nearby house soon after gives John a chance to help Tammy escape but leaves him there with Richie as the police turn up. Richie kills the policeman as well and off they go down the road once more.The police are trying to track down the killer responsible for not only the gas station killings but the cell phone store clerk as well. When they question John's wife its clear that they think John is responsible. He was the last one seen in each spot and no clues concerning Richie are there.John eventually convinces Richie to let him go and he does without threatening him. He does remind John as he drives away that John had invited him to his home for dinner at some point and that he thinks now is the time as he pulls away.John is caught by the police, still the main suspect behind the killings. He knows that Richie is behind it all but how can he convince them? Not only that, can he do so in time to be released and make sure that his family is safe as well?The film has a nice twist during the final portion of the film, one that most won't see coming. Just who Richie is, why he's doing everything he's done and if he truly is nothing more than evil personified is revealed. In any event what we are presented with from start to finish is one of the most terrifying characters ever seen on screen. Jackson does a stand out job speaking calmly yet oozing menace with each word. His actions speak much more than his words but the words give you those chills.I was afraid at first that this film would be boring and take far too long to get going. I was pleasantly surprised with what I found. In a world where people are facing hard times, where everyone feels like someone some where has brewed them over, it's easy to relate to the character of John Felton. At the same time it's easy to see why he changes a bit before the end of the film.",A TRULY FRIGHTENING CHARACTER,1346112000,"08 28, 2012"

"As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan, as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds (e.g.,Law & Order Criminal Intent), I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two part episode (Anna's wobbly spike heels, the short skirt, the misty eyed but knowing looks, her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor, etc.), and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene, dynamite, she showed what she's made of, mettle wise, matching the perp in intensity.  His crimes made sense, though there were gruesome details galore, they struck me as realistic, not gratuitous or designed merely to shock.  I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads, where would it lead?  Then I watched ""seasons"" 2 and 3.Gratuitous, preposterous.  So many gaffes, overlooked leads and details, FOR EXAMPLE, ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3, they did NO background check on the perp's brother (!), and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp's son at the last minute  gosh, he might have gone there!  And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane, no typing in of the plane's serial number to see what where it might be, absurd.  The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER.  MANY plot points are left totally unexplained.  It's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE: Season 2, if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity, much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people's brains with glee, this may be your cup of tea, though I'm sure you'd like a story that makes SENSE as well.  ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders, but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her, also sexually tortures his son and daughters, operates on and removes his daughter's reproductive organs, for FUN.  I couldn't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case, but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity, or the dynamics of the coppers' interpersonal relationships, or what makes the characters tick, but no such luck.  The leads and the other officers evince one dimensional, erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors, ludicrous; for example, one of the daughters jazzaults detectives on two separate occasions, drawing blood, and no one says a word (they don't even fight back, one just slinks away)!  They don't arrest people for jazzaulting police officers in the UK?  Also, they had the perpetrator's voice on tape (I think, or SHOULD have taped his calls), early on could've matched the voice prints, AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him, yet they don't arrest him, simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again.  When they finally do detain him, they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch, and, SURPRISE, he escapes.  And a detective sleeping with a reporter, ""accidentally"" affording him access to her case notes?  And with no repercussions?  COME ON.  Columbo or Inspector Morse this ain't.  Real UK cops must've had a field day with this twaddle.  I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment, but it's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense, (to me, anyway), seeSingle Handed: Natural Justice, a VERY dark (and profane, be forewarned), but superb Irish series available on Instant Video.

"This could have been so much better. The filmmaker has an Organic Industry bias that is very difficult to over come, but at least you were warned up front. It would have been nice to have more of the chemical use exposed as well as what these &#34;organic approved&#34; chemicals are doing to pollute our water and soils. There is the wrong belief that just because it is &#34;natural&#34; and might have come from a food (e.g. lemon juice) it is harmless.  This is so far from the truth as these &#34;organic approved&#34; chemicals typically need to be applied in such high volumes to provide even moderate protection that we are seeing acidification of soils and ground water contamination.It would have been nice to expose the GMO hypocrisy as well as large scale &#34;organic&#34; farms do use seeds that have been genetically modified to ripen faster, have a more consistent size, shape, and color.  I was very glad to see them give a few minutes to imported &#34;organics&#34; and how they might not be so &#34;organic&#34;.  It was good that they drove home the point that Organic Foods is a marketing scheme, not a reality. Sadly, they toned down this reality by &#34;interviewing&#34; certified so called organic farmers who over and over stated they are pure organic farmers and that the consumer needs to believe in the certificate.The solution is to grow what you can and get to know your local produce farmer and if you like their methods buy from them. Do not buy organics that come from Big Ag or that are imported. And for your own health and safety, do not buy leafy foods labeled organic from grocery stores. Buy these only from well known local suppliers. Lastly, understand that if a chemical is killing a pest, it is harmful to the environment.

By ""downhill"" I don't mean disater, because a show of this magnitude, where each episode has so many differnt scenarios, shot on locatiosns cenes, special effects, etc, rarely is mediocre. You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people (cast, producers, technical guys, writers) giving their best for a flawed premise. The Chinese   Russian plot was so farfetched, so forced, so  unplausible. After all, the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology! Also, to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a ""zombie"" was a bad call.Well, that's it. Anyway, I think the show still did not jump the shark, but this will happen soon.",The trouble was the Chinese/Russian plot...,1212364800,"06 2, 2008"
"So Resurrection had a predictably strong opening on network TV and why wouldn't it? Set upon the immediately gripping concept of loved ones returning from the dead, the promise of the premise is strong, surely guaranteeing to hit the sweet spot in the Venn diagram of mystery, fantasy and horror. Yet week after week, ABC misses the mark on the show failing to fire on any of the dramatic cylinders that are clearly primed to compete with the ratings juggernaut of the Walking Dead. How could they have messed this up?As once dead residents of the IQ challenged town of Arcadia start to reappear, it's extraordinary that the least realistic aspect of the show is not the resurrection itself but the staggeringly dumb reaction of any of the characters. Any normal human would ask thousands of questions, wonder if they're zombies, call the Feds, get extensive medical tests, check the coffins for the bodies, go to pray, start a conspiracy theory website, leave the town   anything, literally anything along these lines that the show refuses to do.Ignoring the vastly obvious pit of story opportunities, the writers are hell bent on forcing the story logic into a police procedural yet even the cops and thinly painted medical characters act like they were trained at the same police academy as the FBI from The Following. Instead of taking action on singly the biggest event in recorded history, they do literally nothing and each week the story inches along at glacial speed to the point where I wonder if they remember that these people were dead. It's almost as if the writers are scared of the plot and have just set up a bunch of generic drama moments hoping for something interesting to happen.In my weekly frustration with this show, I finally decided to check out Les Revenants (The Returned) which was a French spin on the idea made a couple of years ago. Cliched as it may sound, this is unfortunately one of those cases where the French original series is so much better that you wonder how the US remake could be so bad. Les Revenants sets up a spooky mystery with a well selected range of engaging characters, approaching the question of whether the Returned are good or malevolent out to destroy the living without ever becoming ridiculous, giving us some first cljazz acting, dialog and subtle plotting along the way.Resurrection meanwhile is doing none of this and by episode 5 is seriously threatening to jump the shark. Suffering from some of the most unimaginative writing in television today and maybe a network that doesn't know which theme and story threads to follow, it's wasting one of the best story concepts in a long time. Rather than spending countless hours for ABC to find the plot, you can just cue up Netflix and enjoy something vastly superior in The Returned   while you have to wade through English subtitles, it's better than waiting for anything to happen in this really bland execution of a great concept.",Infuriatingly close to something good,1397520000,"04 15, 2014"

"The historical cultural research and legends integrated into the plotlines of these episodes is probably what keeps me watching.  The Magnus character and her past life husband are the most compelling characters; the others seem fairly one sided caricatures.  The plot is based on a ""sanctuary"" developed to protect and study ""abnormals""  those creatures with extraordinary powers and curses who could be compromised, exploited by scientists or other abnormals or creatures who pose a threat to the world.  While the premise is interesting, the stories often become sentimental and are verbally relayed rather than revealed through action.

"On one hand, the editing and the cinematography (by Quentin Dupieux) are fabulous.  On the other hand, the screenplay and the direction (by Quentin Dupieux) are dreadful.  Someone should have been fired.This is a movie about a gimmick, played as a gimmick, that doesn't succeed because it is a gimmick that's stretched to its limits and beyond.  Once the premise is set down there's nowhere for this movie to go.  It's a joke that tells you it's a joke.  In fact, it informs you of this straight off and just in case you ""didn't get it,"" they repeat the explanation during the closing credits.  It's been my experience that if something has to be identified as a joke and you don't laugh, repeating it as such isn't going to help.The best parts of this movie involve the tire (Robert) on its own.  The worst parts are when they involve people through a faux audience watching the proceedings and commenting on what they're watching, and a squad of police trying to stop the tire from its reign of terror.  It's sad to say, but the tire gives the best and most realistic performance.","""It's already boring.""",1363737600,"03 20, 2013"

"Ok, I'm about fed up with all this teasing and no action. Every season, D3 ends with Grayson and Jane (Deb) supposedly getting together, and at the last 30 seconds some b.s. jumps off and they don't end up together. At the end of Season 4 when Grayson kissed Jane and Owen had heart attack, I thought, ""Now, we're getting somewhere."" But the entire stretch of Season 5 totally ignored the romantic relationship between Grayson and Jane.And I'm pissed at Jane for agreeing to let Owen donate sperm to Stacy. That is so not cool. After all, it was Stacy who said ""Besties before Testes."" Best friends should not be involved with each other's ex's in any capacity. And lastly, why is it okay for Grayson to go hopping from bed to bed with all these women while Jane remains virtually chaste? I applaud D3 for their interracial romances, but darn, if Grayson really loved Jane he would keep his fly zipped up. I don't know if I'm going to give D3 another chance when Season 6 airs in October.

"I've seen that a lot of this, this year, shows just seem to be phoning in their episodes... or, it's like a group of people sat down in a room and came up with some pretty decent &#34;situations&#34;, then stacked and glued them together to try and make a coherent script out of it all.Suits, when it first came out, season 1, I gave it 5 Stars.  It was extremely well done, and well acted.  Can't really remember how many times I sat and rewatched the episodes.Season 2, starting failing a bit, plot wandered, actors did things that didn't seem to fit the virtual simulations of them that I kept in my head (yeah, I know, I'm weird that way).  I rewatched some episodes, but the conflict between the main characters weren't what I was &#34;buying&#34; into.Season 3, even more so.  Some good scenes, but sharks are jumped all over the place to get to them.  The team member conflict is under control, but some of the logic behind what they do, how they do it, and some of the limitations posed on them by the world they live in (can't get a delay in a court case to show up a few days later?  I mean there's real world stuff out here, where the people involved have delayed things for over a year?).

"I have been a huge fan of ""Elementary"" from the first episode, and I look forward to a new one on Thursday nights.  The writing is great, with plenty of suspense and humor.  I like the twisty plots, and I love the relationship between Holmes and Watson.  The dialogue is believable and funny; at other times, it can be heartbreaking.  These two characters work so well together, leaning on each other, being tough and demanding when necessary. It's all good, and I am enjoying the ride with this show.I also want to mention that the acting by the entire cast is incredible.  Jonny Lee Miller is showing us his best work so far, in my opinion, and reveals many different layers with Holmes.  Just when we think we know him, sort of....he surprises us, and Joan, with his sensitivity and empathy in certain situations.  Jonny Lee Miller is underrated and may never be recognized with an Emmy, but he SO deserves one for this performance.  I am also very impressed with Lucy Liu's performance as Joan Watson.  She has great chemistry with JLM and I'm glad there is no ""romantic"" or sexual tension between them, at least not yet.  Aidan Quinn is perfectly cast in the role of Captain Gregson.  He adds so much to the show, and I hope to see his character fleshed out more in future episodes.I would highly recommend this show to anyone who enjoys suspenseful crime dramas with a few twists and plenty of humor.","""Elementary"" is so addictive....the writing and acting are top notch",1389830400,"01 16, 2014"

"While ""Sanctuary"" is a clever science fiction show, it's never especially compelling.  Much of the time, I find myself falling asleep halfway through an episode.  (If, at that point, I happen to switch to some other time shifted TV show on my DVR or a DVD, there usually isn't any nodding off, so it's not a question of fatigue.)  Every week, a wild not entirely half baked storyline is thrown out, a lot of crazy business ensues and, by the end of the episode, the whole Sanctuary team is sipping tea in Helen Magnus' office.  While the show touches upon interesting topics such as giant abnormals living in the earth in some sort of collective Gaia like symbiotic relationship, every week this sort of thing is being fired your way en mjazze.  Sanctuary blends steampunk, religion (Kali, for one), abnormal myth (vampires, werewolves, etc.), historical figures (James Watson, Jack the Ripper, Nikola Tesla, etc.), science and adventure together and then funnels the concoction down your throat.  It's all a little hard to swallow.  **1 2 out of *****.That being said, I was glad to see the loss of one regular character this season (hint: it's the worst actor on the show) and the introduction of a new one.  The whole Cabal storyline is wrapped up entirely too quickly.Despite my issues with the show, I also watched season 3, which introduces hollow earth into the mix and is an improvement over season 2.","Always the last show I watch, but not because I'm saving the best for last",1306713600,"05 30, 2011"

"The pilot was a little frantic, jumping around more to fulfill the &#34;hook&#34; requirements of a pilot than to dig into a serious plot. The usual quick collection of characters suggests that every episode will be obligated to follow each one of them, even if some play no real part in the series' story arc for a while. This gets weary, as viewers usually can recognize the fatigue of the writer(s) as they labor to fulfill the requirements of the series bible. What concerns me more, however, is that the whole presentation is so reminiscent of that weird tradition of &#34;mysterious&#34; TV series    namely to tantalize us for season after season without ever really going anywhere. One fears that even if it gets addictive (with gimmicks like tossing in the alien demon whatever at the end of S1E1), the payoff may never arrive (especially if the thing is canceled prematurely). In such cases, trying to figure out what the heck was going on turns out to be a waste of time.This may not be one of those frustrating productions, and it may have a long, interesting story to tell, but the pilot doesn't give us much to go on. There really isn't any &#34;story&#34; beyond a puzzling situation, with a surprise &#34;third element&#34; to sweeten the mystery at the end. That's why I'm afraid I'm about to be spoon fed one tidbit of revelation per episode, and the big backstory that would explain everything and make sense out of it all might not even exist. The best of this genre tell a gripping story in each episode, wrapped in a plausible and equally gripping series arc, but this one hasn't done that yet. I haven't written it off, but the pilot has me coming back almost exclusively just for &#34;what happens next.&#34; If that's all it's got to keep me coming back, then that's not enough.","Tough call, this early on...",1391731200,"02 7, 2014"
"I wasn't aware that there was a hoarder show just for people who hoard animals, I thought that hoarders was the only such show.

Specific to animal hoarders, the use of local humane society or SPCA's were used to rescue the animals. For the episodes I found that there was slow play back which was annoying since it was evident that the content was loading but took somewhere between two to seven minutes to properly load. This issue occurred at least twice within one episode.

"Despite a very good cast and clever stories, I just couldn't like the lead actor.  He looks like a runway model, first of all, and secondly his character is written as shallow, deceitful, self absorbed, and manipulative.  He's just not likable.  Yet in every story the decent, caring, honest people all around him repeatedly overlook his betrayal of their trust!  He puts their careers, even their lives, in danger over and over again, but they accept his apology and go ahead and trust him again and again.  In real life he would be considered a sociopath and anyone involved with him would be a victim of his abusive, toxic personality.  Moving past the unpleasant lead character, let's talk about the women in his life.  All the women cast as his romantic interests are so thin as to look disturbingly anorexic.  Painfully scrawny, boney, and unhealthy.  Honestly, is this STILL the message we want to send to young women?  To starve themselves in order to be successful and desirable?

"Modern conspiracy theories are common these days, but they've been with us forever, as evidenced by theories about missing Ninth Legion of the Roman Empire. Centurion explains what happened to the Ninth from the point of view of someone who was there.Our hero, Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fjazzbender) becomes part of the Ninth's destiny when Picts overrun his garrison. He escapes, only to discover that Roman governor of Brittania, Julius Agricola (Paul Freeman), has committed the general of the Ninth Legion, Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) to eradicate the Pict threat.  Their secret weapon is Etain (Olga Kurylenko), a mute Bringantian scout.  With his inside knowledge, it's not long before Dias acts as Virilus' right hand man against the Picts. SPOILTURION: If you know your Roman history, you know this isn't going to end well.Legendary Roman discipline fails in the face of the devious Picts and a surprise betrayal leaves just a handful of men alive.  When they discover Virilus has been captured deep in enemy territory, Dias and his ragtag band form a desperate rescue mission. Along the way the men bond and betray one another, as each falls to privation and violence.This is a gritty movie with few likable characters.  Children, prisoners, and even cooks are murdered as a matter of expedience. The main antagonist has no speaking parts, which makes for an unusual villain.  Most of the movie takes place in the sweeping countryside, a character unto itself.Centurion is more interested in legend than fact.  The Picts are a conglomeration of everything Romans ever reported about them   women warriors, lime in the hair, blue battle paint and all.  This at least makes them more interesting than the typical dirty barbarian types that usually act as villains in films of this sort.Unfortunately, Centurion's plot is as serpentine as a Roman column.  There are long stretches of countryside views that, while beautiful, begin to drag. The audio is muffled   I'm starting to think is a problem endemic to outdoor war films, because King Arthur had the same problem. When Dias finally decides to stand and fight, it's an exciting battle...and then the film limps along to resolve two other major plot points.  The script could have used more polishing.What it lacks in plot, Centurion tries to make up with gore. This is a crazy violent movie, with more gore than most horror films.  One of the first battle scenes has so many limbs chopped off, heads sawed in half, and gurgling throat cuts that it really detracted from the movie as a whole.  The bloody effects    an artifact of the movie 300, which seems to have made every producer jazzume they can get away with CGI blood   look cartoony.  At one point, a guy's head explodes when he runs into a tree.All this adds up to an ambitious but uneven movie.  Centurion tries many different things and only succeeds at half of them.

If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults (and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time) should have been paid.

Ms Ryan tries to give this piece heart. The Character , a bartender , is given her bionics after an auto accident with her Government surgeon boyfriend.  She is saddled her with a felony kid sister (Lucy Hale) who was dumped on her when their father disappeared. Ryan is one of the reason's to watch this show.However, the heart of the show is buried deep within sub plots of the previous sort of Evilish bionic woman Sarah (Katee Sackhoff from the remake Of Gallatica) and ideas of double crossing people that seemed to be ripped off from old ALIAS plots. This new Woman is told is a soap opera form, which weaken this piece.The highlight of the show after Ryan  is Miguel Ferrer as the mysterious  Jonas. He plays a tough as nails agency boss, better than Richard Anderson ever played Oscar Goldman. His stone cold demeanor works well in this character, better than he did in Crossing Jordan (which season one is coming on DVD soon)The funnest thing about this new Bionic Woman. She  has $50,000 dollars worth of bionics parts, up from the 1970's amount of six million..inflation, inflation, inflation!I am sadden that only eight episodes (which are all presented here) were made of this series before the writer's strike of TV season 2007 2008. It had promise, but we may never know if it could have developed. NBC Network  has not stated if this show has been renewed for the next season. So these eight episodes may be the only  episodes of this seriesI can only wish that someone would release the cljazzic Six Million Dollar man or the original Bionic woman on DVD...Now that was great television!Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD",Did We Really Need to Rebuild Her?,1208304000,"04 16, 2008"

"I'm an original fan, live a short distance from Southfork for the past 14 years and we original fans are the ones who buy & own all the DVDs. So they should take care to ensure we like the show. The dumbest thing they could do was to start the new show by having Bobby sell Southfork; ignore his son's heritage & opinions; and make stupid decisions without doing any research as if he was some dumb cowboy like Ray Krebbs with no business background. This story line was incredibly offensive to most original fans and alienated any loyalty to Bobby's character.  No one could feel any sympathy for him. What idiot wrote that? Duffy? Hagman?The new cast members all look alike & the writing will have to improve by 80%. Hopefully by finding some new writers who actually know the original series. For instance, Bobby did not inherit Southfork. Miss Ellie, via Clayton Farlow, signed over ownership of Southfork to Bobby in the last season and gave JR the control of Ewing Oil shares.  So John Ross could not overturn something that occurred before her Will which had nothing to do with Bobby owning Southfork.We all know the mineral rights for Southfork were always separate from the deed and used to trap Jeremy Wendell when dumb Ray sold his land. JR never would have forgotten that.Sue Ellen did not hide John Ross away at boarding schools... JR did. John Ross joined his mother because JR had become so consumed with James and destroying Cally over Weststar and Vanessa. So John Ross's comments were off base.The only 2 new characters with any charisma and character potential are Rebecca and Bobby's wife Ann. The rest of the new cast are duds and should be recast with new actors after they find new writers who actually watched the entire original series. Not some short attention span newbie who scanned through the episodes.Cliff's seething revenge attitude no longer makes sense. He owns Ewing oil and JR was a vegetable in a nursing home when the new series began. Cliff should be happy & gloating; not creating devious destruction plans and certainly would not hurt his nephew Christopher. Cliff also never wanted Southfork. That was miss Ellie's home, not oil well's that Jock stole from Digger. The only person Cliff should be angry at and seeking revenge upon is Afton who cruelly and illegally kept his daughter from seeing or knowing him. Or angry at JR; if & when he tries to take back Ewing Oil.Someone also needs to convince Hagman that those ridiculous eyebrows are not his trademark. They make him look like some Alzheimer geezer who is incapable of personal grooming. The eyebrows are nasty.Duffy and Hagman also need to do better with the characters of Lucy and Ray. Those fleeting cameos were an insult to the actors and fans. They were both core characters who battled JR. We need to see more of them but without repeats of old mistakes as if they never learned their lessons. They should be stronger and smarter now but angry with Bobby for the selling Southfork fiasco.Also, let us not forget about Lucas   Bobby's natural son, as well as James and Cally's baby who were both Jr's natural born offspring. They each have claims on the Ewing legacy.Focusing the later episodes of the original series on Bobby & JR with an endless parade of Bimbo's for their off~set pleasure is what destroyed Dallas the first time and permanently chased away Victoria Principal. Just look at the ratings after Pam and then even more so when Sue Ellen left and the ratings plummeted. Hagman & Duffy & the producer Katzman were so blinded by the procession of Bimbo's, they couldn't see their decisions were the problem.Dallas was not a male fan dominated series. Vast numbers of women watched it for the glamour & power & interactions of the cast. (Glamour: as in jewels, clothes, furs, money... not bimbo's and sex). Especially the interactions of Sue Ellen & Pam fighting back to hold their own. They ruined Pam by making her run away and whine instead of sticking by Bobby & fighting for their marriage. Sue Ellen was at her best when she was successful and not rolling in the gutter. The bimbo's were shallow and offensive to both male and female fans. Any viewers who need an endless parade of swimsuit models to keep their interest   are not watching Prime time soap operas. They are watching the X rated channels or out cruising street corners and bars.The producers should have a little common sense this time and don't depend on those hack Nielson ratings and opinions which never contact the actual audience and caused cancellations of wildly popular shows that has enraged fans for decades. Most of the fans and cast have died waiting for a new Dallas and the original Dallas DVD sets which took forever to complete; while some anarchistic Xgen tried to create a mockery comedy to get revenge on their parents generation. Thanks to Travolta for refusing to go along with it.Let us hope they learn from their mistakes this time before it is too late. This show can be a success again if they don't waste this second chance which has taken far too long.",Plot Mistakes & corrections needed,1351728000,"11 1, 2012"

"First off I'm gonna lay this on the table I'm a big Dario Argento fan.  I""m actually a big, geeky Argento fanboy. As a matter of fact, Argento is my favorite film director.  Even got to meet him once.  So now that you know that, you'll probably jazzume that I tend to give many of his recent films the benefit of the doubt.  That's true, I do try to look for the positives, but I'm not deaf or blind I am well aware that Argento's films have been a little.....lacking.... in the last decade or so.  It's the same kinda deal with guys like Romero and Hooper, where you don't really like to admit to yourself that they just aren't putting out very good stuff anymore.But I like to keep the faith.  I like to think that one day Argento will come out with something that'll kick us all in the teeth and make us forget about Phantom of the Opera or Giallo, or....take your pick.With a heavy heart I have to say that his version of Dracula just isn't that movie.  I mean, hell, the idea sounds great in theory, doesn't it?  Dario Argento taking on Dracula?  Of course in this daydream, it's the Suspiria era Argento taking on Dracula that I'm imagining, not the Mother of Tears Giallo director.  So, yes, the idea of Argento doing a Hammer esque movie sounds great.  But it isn't.If this film didn't already have Argento's name slapped onto it, I'd have had no idea he had directed it.  There's really nothing about it that says, ""This is a Dario Argento movie"" except for maybe his daughter baring her breasts.  What would a post 1993 Argento movie be without Asia showing us her boobs and or butt?  In fact, this movie looks like something you'd see on the Syfy channel.  Syfy Channel Presents Dracula!  I would have guessed that before Argento had I gone into this totally ignorant.Thomas Kretchmann  makes for one of the most unmemorable movie Draculas of all time.  I kinda like the fact that Argento decided to try an actor who didn't fit the stereotypical Dracula look......but he still isn't good.  In fact, nobody here is that good.  Hauer just barely reaches good.There is way too much CGI in this film.  You want to instantly ruin a film for me, throw in some CGI, especially in places where it is totally lazy and unnecessary like showing a spider crawl through it's web.  Or flies buzzing around a room. Or how about the silly CGI ""WHOOSH"" that accompanies Dracula when he's supposed to be moving fast?  Like in the scene where he charges into Harker's room and attacks him!  Find me someone who thinks this looks good and I'll eat my Official Sun Records baseball cap.  CGI has no place in a horror film to begin with, and while it looks lifeless and flat when done ""well"", it's especially irritating when it's lousy, as it is here.What the hell happened here?  What's happened to Dario Argento?  I'm not giving up on the guy, but something really went wrong here.  Unfortunately this will be a lot of peoples' first exposure to Argento.  If you're one of these people, please don't think this is a great representation of Dario Argento's work.  That would be like judging Judas Priest solely by the Turbo album.I'm a bit let down, but I know Argento still has a great one in him.  Lets just hope he doesn't try for Frankenstein next, though.","Well, It Certainly Bites.",1392336000,"02 14, 2014"
"A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.The only other film I've seen from writer director Ti West was ""The House of the Devil"" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the story overall was a mess. Like most (if not all) haunted type flicks there is something at the center of the haunting needing resolve. Here it's a woman who hanged herself on her wedding day. Little clues are given but there is no logical building of the clues to a resolve. The viewer never finds out what happened to bring on the misery. I'm not certain what the mother son characters were there for. They have nothing to do with the story and are written out of the script about two thirds the way in. There are a couple of cheap, jump scares and there is no way to know why it ends the way it does. And what about the old guy? He is nowhere integral to the story. Was he needed to fill in the clock? This movie is just stupid over and over. All it really has are a couple of good characters. I liked Sarah Paxton and Pat Healy as the two leads. But they just couldn't get their story, or the overall story, on track. And Kelly McGillis is a veteran. She does a decent job, but it's way too convenient that she shows up in this place on this particular weekend.The production values are good enough. The Yankee Pedlar is a cool place with a lot of personality. It made for a great setting, but there just wasn't enough here for a movie, and what little there was was put together all wrong.",Well Intensioned Stupidity,1349913600,"10 11, 2012"
"While the show was kind of amusing, like in the first episode where they block a drain in the loading dock of their company to create a pond, without thinking of where trucks will unload; the entire premise of the show is highlighting the old stereotype of how stupid Southerners are. The Patriarch of the family who advises his grandson that it doesn't matter if his future wife is homely as long as she can cook, got my back up, and then the continuous portrayal of hunting for frogs ( a personal favorite animal of mine) beavers (another favorite) and on and on, put me off, and what might be kind of funny because the characters are so odd, just left me cold. I know people hunt to live, and there are regional specialties of the South(I live near Everglades and frog legs are big here) I simply couldn't watch frogs having their feet cut off, skinned, etc. I almost want to take Season 1 home and give it just one more try, because there were funny moments I could identify with like when the snake falls into the boat from a tree(this actually happened to me once) and the guy goes over the side to get away. If I can watch vampires feed on people (ie; True Blood) and love it anyway, maybe I can get past all the ""political"" incorrectness by thinking of it as Archie Bunker meets Honey Boo boo.

"Back in 2007 I was in Toronto and met some guys who screened Demons 2 one night.  Before the film began they showed a collection of film trailers for Argento films, spaghetti westerns and such, and then the original HOBO trailer played.  It was a wonderfully done trailer that rivaled the ones used in the Tarantino Rodriguez Grindhouse film.  The director was present in the theater but I didn't speak to him then(too bad), but I always remembered the trailer.  I never thought it would actually become a feature film, let alone star Rutger Hauer.So here we are Hobo With A Shotgun is a reality, and the exploitation world is the better for it.  Basically it's about a hobo that comes into a crime ridden town and decides to go Bronson when he's seen(and experienced) enough.  The town in the movie is super exaggerated in it's criminal activity it's a friggin' warzone!  Think of the gang ruled neighborhood in Death Wish 3 and that's how this entire town is!  But then again, everything here is exaggerated.  This movie is very cartoony and brings to mind images of Troma(in fact, a character in the film is wearing a Troma shirt in one scene).  Rutger Hauer is the odd one out in that he's basically the ""normal"", non cartoon character here.  And that really makes it work.  His downplaying against everyone else's over the top playing really helps give the movie that additional edge to bring it above being total silliness(along with the hot young lady who plays the prostitute.  I forgot her name at the moment).  We all love Hauer, you'd have to be some kind of communist not to.  Though he's been in numerous B movies throughout the years, we've never seen him in something quite like this, something more tongue in cheek.  Movies like Bleeders, Crossworlds and Turbulence 3 Heavy Metal were schlock, but schlock taking itself a bit more seriously.  It's a nice change of pace for Hauer.The film has a decent amount of gore.  Some say it surpjazzes Machete.  I'm not sure if it does.  Perhaps, but unlike Machete, the gore here is not CGI, which elevates it substantially.The second disc(if you're thinking of buying the 2 disc version) has a nice Making Of.. documentary, interviews with Hauer and director Eisener by Fangoria magazine, the alternate ending, and the original fake trailer(though this may be on disc one, I forgot).  I haven't watched the film on ""Shotgun Mode"" yet, so I'm not sure on that one.All in all, a very good ""grindhouse"" style film here.  Usually these modern throwback movies leave alot to be desired and make you wish you had used your time to watch an actual grindhouse movie instead of these weak imitations.Hobo With A Shotgun is one to be proud of the grindhouse throwback status.  It earns it.",You Know You Wanna Watch This!,1310169600,"07 9, 2011"
"&#8220;Grand Piano,&#34;inspired by Alfred Hitchcock&#8217;s &#8220;The Man Who Knew Too Much,&#8221; never achieves the caliber of the Hitchcock film but it is a neat thriller in its own right. Tom Selznick (Elijah Wood) is the most talented pianist of his generation but has stopped performing in public because of stage fright. Years after a catastrophic performance, he reappears in public for a long awaited concert in Chicago. In a packed theater, in front of an eager, expectant audience, Tom finds a message written on the score: &#8220;Play one wrong note and you die.&#8221; In the sights of an anonymous sniper (John Cusack), Tom must get through the performance and look for help without being detected.There are flaws in the scripting, but Wood does an effective job of conveying Tom&#8217;s fear and confusion as he proceeds with the concert under incredible stress. Though not exactly an average Joe, Tom is caught up in an extraordinary life death predicament and must rely on his wits to get through it. The mystery of why the sniper has fixated on Tom is revealed as the story unfolds and the suspense escalates.Bonus DVD extras include a making of featurette, interviews, and a behind the scenes look at the film&#8217;s stunts and visual effects.",Hitchcock it's not...,1401062400,"05 26, 2014"

"But I'm not among them, especially.  The acting was very creditable, and I enjoy dramas that play out in small spaces with few characters.  But in this case, none of the characters was likeable enough for me to care what happened to him or her.  There is no way to say anything more about this movie without mjazzive spoilers, so be warned.The suspense of the story depends largely on the rate of revelation attached to our learning the interrelationships among key characters.  Throughout the course of the story, we find out that not only is Alice romantically attached to one of the kidnappers, but that the two (male) kidnappers are romantically attached to each other.  That puts one kidnapper as a pretty interesting corner of a triangle, and makes him pivotal to how the story eventually unfolds.There is a relatively high ""ick"" factor with a not unrealistic (but not terribly welcome) focus on toilet functions, vomit, and awkward sex (and no, I don't mean the men kissing, although I'm sure some would include that on an ""ick factor list"" as well).  All the action that takes place within the kidnapper's hideout seem completely realistic and natural, but once the locations start changing, it becomes hard to believe that events play out as they do.  People do not seem to die, for example, until their full dramatic potential has been reached, which might make for all right entertainment, but in a story set apart by its attention to verisimilitude, it does strain credulity to the snapping point.I feel compelled to mention one aspect of the movie that was well, well above the standards for most thrillers of this type (even the artier thrillers), and that's the music, which was perfectly complementary, unobtrusive, but powerfully effective in evoking the appropriate feelings of excitement, stress, dread, and relief.If you like Hitchcock style suspense and stories that turn very much of characters and relationships, there is much to like in ""Alice Creed.""

"For months leading up to my viewing of this film, all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth my time it is.  Am I missing something?  This seemed like pretty run of the mill stuff.  I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint (House of the Devil was really good) and give his films character.  However, despite the good direction, atmosphere and acting, I can't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I haven't seen before.  Unless, like I said, I missed something.  I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own, and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers.  If you're a fan of this type of ghost story, and you're a bit older than the twenty something set (like me), then you've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this.  Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end didn't do much to help its plot, either.  I don't know, maybe someone out there can tell me what's sailing over my head because I just don't get why so many people are rallying around this movie.

It was predictable humor which translates into unfunny. The swearing and drug use was forced and unnatural.

"If you love them or hate them this show connects you with how a Law Firm works. it quickly introduces each lawyer and their expertise, then shows what they bring to the table and how things are served up. The work that is done to help you or burn you depending on if they are your attorney's or coming after you. The real twist is how different they are away from work.

"Well, it's great fun if you like extreme violence and soap opera. Normally neither one of those by itself can get me excited, let alone combined. In this case Kurt Sutter and crew have pulled off a masterpiece. It takes great writing, great producing, great directing and great acting to get me interested in the lives of people I wouldn't want to know, let alone be, and that's exactly what 'Sons of Anarchy' has. Sutter manages to borrow just the right amount of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' and 'The Godfather' to make a show similar to 'The Sopranos' but from the bottom of the criminal barrel rather than the top. I had never heard of Charlie Hunnam, but this British born actor is perfect as Jax Teller. Katie Sagal takes a dark turn from her usual comedy as the biker witch queen who will do just about anything to protect her family, even when it's from people whose only crime is to not fit her twisted idea of perfection. She walks a fine line between &#34;saving&#34; her son and driving him away. Ron Perlman is also terrific as the king of the Sons, who not only has to keep his stepson in line but also keep him from finding out about his own darker deeds.The rest of the cast are also perfect for the roles they play, and manage to make a group of not very nice characters into someone we can consistently relate to, if not exactly like.",Great Fun,1378080000,"09 2, 2013"

"I really don't understand why this show was brought back. There are too many characters every one of them irritating, and none of them are sympathetic. There's constantly too much uproar and turmoil among them and around them as the plots are confusing and uninspiring. The leader, a doctor, is a pompous and inept person with an agenda to promote specially gifted people he calls ""alphas"" but who are generally antisocial and even dangerous unless he alone can get them to behave civily for a few moments per episode.  The special gifts are already boring  example: the close up of the ""strong man's"" arteries as he pumps up. I can't stand ""Gary"" the human fiber optic reader. He's neither engaging nor cute, never funny, just a thorn in the side of all because he's special but wait, they are all special! He don't care. He's more specialer.  Just that character alone is so annoying I don't plan to spend any more time ""with him"" watching this. This show should have vanished along with ""3 inches"", a show about a guy with telekinetic powers but could only do it as far as 3 inches. At least that had some humorous potential.

"After scoring blockbuster ratings as well as multiple EMMY nominations for the dramatic miniseries ""Hatfields & McCoys,"" the History Channel is forging forward with its first ever scripted series in ""Vikings."" I don't know about you, but a series about Vikings seems perfectly attuned to a television market that is currently enjoying a plethora of dark and complex adult dramas on cable networks! Created by Michael Hirst, this nine episode series was shot in Ireland and looks absolutely terrific. One of the things that most surprised me on checking out this endeavor is just how expensive the series looks in terms of period recreations, sets, locations, and effects. It shouldn't be too surprising, Hirst has worked on a number of noteworthy historical dramatizations including Showtime's ""The Tudors"" (which he created) and ""The Borgias"" (on which he is an executive producer). As with any fictionalization, though, you should expect some liberties to be taken with the subject for the purposes of storytelling. I don't think, however, that this will be too distracting unless you are a scholar of the period expecting exacting detail.The show basically revolves around one Norse clan. Travis Fimmel plays Ragnar, who in the early episodes is constructed as a family man who yearns to break free from the oppression of his tribe's leader (Gabriel Byrne as Earl Haraldson). Setting on his own course, he recruits a small band of brothers to attempt a victorious raid to the west in defiance of the Earl's express wishes. There will be numerous repercussions to this decision as the various parties jostle for power and any grasp on true leadership is tenuous at best. Like other series of the same tone (Game of Thrones comes to mind), ""Vikings"" is a blend of contemplative drama, hefty doses of skullduggery and plotting, and wild and unexpected bouts of violence. This being History, however, the actual content is noticeably less graphic than if the show had appeared on premium cable (though there is still plenty of blood letting and decapitations).One of the primary successes of ""Vikings"" comes from the casting. Fimmel has been kicking around for a while, it's nice to see him step up into a role with gravitas. This may finally be the performance to push him to the next tier of his career. Byrne, always great, really has a meaty role here as well. Katheryn Winnick (Fimmel's wife), Clive Standen (Fimmel's brother), Jessalyn Gilsig (Byrne's wife), Gustaf Skarsgrd (an eccentric shipbuilder) and George Blagden (a monk turned slave) round out some of the primary roles.  Later in the Season, Donal Logue pops up as well. Each is well cast. Winnick, in particular, has to juggle a lot in a role that requires her to be nurturing, sexy, and tough enough to be a part of the Viking mythology.In the end, ""Vikings"" is a show that takes its time to develop and that's a good thing. Because as the tension escalates and the dangers increase, you want to be invested in the characterizations. ""Vikings"" may not be perfect, but it creates a believable environment, has a solid cast, and stunning production values. Ultimately being fiction, it may be one step away from the History Channel representing actual history but it's a LOT closer then the roster of reality programs the network has been showcasing lately. I think this is a really good effort that should be appreciated by adult audiences.

"(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;Two years ago, Mark Fisher disappeared from his home in rural Maine in a brilliant flash of otherworldly blue light.  His friend Seth Hampton was the last to see him alive.  Now, Seth is having disturbing premonitions that Mark has returned as something other than human &#8230;&#8221;That&#8217;s really all you need to know about whether or not ALMOST HUMAN falls within your sphere of influence.  Now &#8211; if it does &#8211; then you&#8217;re likely to find something worthwhile in all of its low budget schlock.  Will it change how you look at movies?  Probably not.  Will it force you to reexamine your life?  It definitely shouldn&#8217;t.  Will it earn a place alongside, say, CITIZEN KANE as rivaling the best movie ever made?  If you need to ask, then you&#8217;re too far gone for me to help!ALMOST HUMAN is an old school style thriller, which essentially means it was shot on a budget and won&#8217;t have any of the niceties of contemporary motion pictures more likely known to the mjazzes at large.  The story revolves around the idea of alien abduction &#8211; there are plenty of flashbacks to support that something is definitely &#8216;out there&#8217; &#8211; but, before it&#8217;s all over, it&#8217;ll end up raising more questions than it ever could answer on such a paltry sum.That doesn&#8217;t mean that it&#8217;s poor filmmaking, folks.  What it does mean is that it&#8217;s probably made by folks who have an unflinching fascination with indie thrills, and they wanted to get together for the sole purpose of producing something they believed could stand cheek to cheek with the slasher stuff of old.  It does work effectively on that level, but &#8211; as is so often the case these days when young auteurs sit in the catbird seat &#8211; writer director producer cameraman Joe Begos was probably stretched so thin that he&#8217;d never uncover the narrative weaknesses of what he created, much less cared to go out and look for them.For example, he&#8217;s overly concerned with throwing stuff at the wall (not only blood) as one character after another really show up and audiences are expected to care about them.  There are hints provided to the established relationships, but the niceties of developing relationships or establishing &#8216;beats&#8217; are little more than condiments barely covering the meat &#8230; meat that&#8217;ll be sliced, hacked, chainsawed, or space raped (seriously, it happens!) before the lights come up and the credits roll.What ended up happening for me is that I was constantly reminded of other pictures that had already explored these ideas &#8211; abduction, consciousness swapping, body snatching, etc. &#8211; to far greater effect in the past; this has the unfortunate effect of pulling me out of HUMAN and putting me back in, say, THE HIDDEN.  I don&#8217;t imagine this is what Begos desired; why would he make his own feature, after all, if all he wanted to do was remind me of other films?  Because so much of what&#8217;s here ends up feeling like it was culled from elsewhere, HUMAN lacks any real conviction to the story it tries to tell independent of those influences.  It reminds me that what looks great isn&#8217;t necessarily filling; rather, it just looks good when all is said and done.Lastly, it&#8217;s never a good thing when a motion picture fades to black and produces a laughable &#8216;that&#8217;s it&#8217; moment.  True &#8211; for those who were watching closely &#8211; there is one of those handy post credits sequences that adds a bit more to the story; but it doesn&#8217;t add to or reshape the narrative in any meaningful capacity, ultimately being an extraneous moment promising &#8216;more to come.&#8217;I&#8217;ll probably ignore the sequel if it happens.ALMOST HUMAN (2013) is produced by Channel 83 Films and Ambrosino   Delmenico.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group under the IFC Midnight label.  As for the technical specifications, there&#8217;s an awful lot of surprising grain in this indie chiller, but the sights and sounds work pretty well for the creative intent.  Lastly &#8211; if it&#8217;s special features you want &#8211; then you&#8217;re about to be thrilled by two audio commentaries, a too expansive making off documentary, other behind the scenes shorts, a short film, and more.  It&#8217;s a great jazzortment for those who might be interested in trying this at home.RECOMMENDED.  Depending upon how closely you&#8217;re watching, you&#8217;re liable to find problems aplenty with ALMOST HUMAN; but the truth is I suspect that the makers only intended you to have fun with such a visceral throwback to times when horror didn&#8217;t have to make an awful lot of narrative sense.  No, you won&#8217;t know where the aliens came from or what their purpose was.  No, you won&#8217;t really have all of the answers you want to who these characters are, why they were targeted, or what it all means.  But the schlock &#8211; glorious schlock! &#8211; is lean and mean enough to satisfy horror fans for the bulk of its 80 minutes.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me a DVD copy of ALMOST HUMAN by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Throwback Chiller A Bit Too Derivative For Its Own ALMOST HUMAN Goodness,1402790400,"06 15, 2014"
"This show could use some better editing and less crime drama dialogue. You've got a great cast that can pull it along, but the pace was incredibly slow and the dialogue was &#34;cop show&#34; predictable. The best thing about it was the amount shown in the court scenes. It seemed like the creators had a legal consultant, but forgot to do their ride along. With the redundant flashbacks of the shooting, the unbelievable allowances that his supervisor was giving him after he was suspended and the fact that he did at least 3 things in the show that would have resulted in disciplinary action and demotion makes this show try too hard to have the stereotypical rebel cop.

The two women he ends up choosing between are both very pleasant, attractive, and decent  which was a nice change from the usual tripe of the snooty, spoiled actress vs. the sincerely lovable shopgirl.  He was simply out of his league with the actress and finally realized the shopgirl was a better match.  Ho Hum.  I like David Tennant in his other work, but he brought nothing new or appealing to this film.  It was if he was on holiday and just walked through the role.  I wonder if he was bored with the script, too?",Dull and uninspired script can't be saved by a likable ...,1398211200,"04 23, 2014"

"I would really, really, like to know why! Why are these type of shows, i.e., end of the world, almost end of the world, alien invasion, mysterious unexplained power loss, the devil and his minions land on earth, type of shows, are so poorly written.  The end of civilization is upon us, but it takes, what several episodes, for the main characters to get their heads brewed on straight.  Please, this is an outrage. One would think, objectively that, at least the cop, would be clear headed enough to realize that  ""it"" has hit the fan and security, like closing and securing the metal gate behind them would be important. Why not?  What, because all people are basically good?  Really! No thoughts on how to counter brute force when necessary, and yes, in this situation it would be instantly necessary to counter brute force.  The takers are everywhere and need only a small opportunity to revert to type.  No thoughts on security totally lame, no organizing; jazzessing and gathering food, water, weapons, ammunition, proper  clothing, shoes, you know the basics, in an end of the world scenario would be first priority in this situation.  The only characters with credibility are the old woman and the black man.  I can only hope, probably without good reason, based on what I have seen so far in this pilot, that this show, if any more are filmed, will be any better written.

"We are in a small town in Iowa to witness the finals in the annual butter carving contest. The perennial winner has agreed not to compete in the future, so his ambitious wife has stepped up to the plate for next year's competition. In the meantime we have a newcomer, a little girl who has discovered her own talent; her adoptive parents are totally supportive. (She hasn't unpacked her suitcase yet, because of her past history as a foster child.)The culture in small town Iowa is naturally the butt of a lot of jokes from sophisticated Hollywood, but my favorite character is the car dealer who agrees to help that ambitious wife mess up that little girl's entry. As I watched, I kept thinking he reminded me of Hugh Jackman....Here are some of the players:* Ty Burrell (""Modern Family"") is that talented (but now retired) sculptor. He hasn't been entirely faithful to...* Jennifer Garner (""The Invention of Lying"") his wife who intended to use his string of victories to generate a political career.* Yara Shahidi (Lots of TV) is that talented newcomer to the butter sculpting community.* Alicia Silverstone (Lots of TV) is the adoring new mother, happy to adopt such a beautiful little girl and help her express her inner sculptor.* Rob Corddry (""Warm Bodies"") is the new daddy, supportive and proud of his bright little girl.* Olivia Wilde (""Rush"") is the stripper who had a fling with the butter carving champion. She tells the little girl she works at Barnes & Noble.* ...and Hugh Jackman (""Wolverine"") speaks pure Midwestern American. Whatta guy! His prayers to Jesus are heartfelt and very, very funny.This R rated outing (language and sexual situations) is sappy and predictable, but who cares; it's heartwarming and satisfying.

"This is the soap opera of sci fi.  One reviewer said it was Battlestar Gallactica mixed with Stargate: I think this was supposed to be Deep Space Nine.  The first episodes were somewhat interesting, yet full of pretty speculative jazzertions and at least one enormous jazzumption.  Yeah, the Air Force has put some kind of a puzzle into your video game and if you solve it, they just might kidnap you.  Pretty sure that isn't happening, so put the controller down and get out into the sunshine kiddo.  They also put all kinds of tired liberal clich&eacute;s into the writing.  The guy who beats his kid because of his Desert Storm experience?  Well, they don't know much about actual abuse stats, but that is sort of the way an out of touch Hollywood writer type sees the world.

"Having never been a particular Joss Whedan fan, (although I rather liked the `old west in space' concept of Firefly and watched it in reruns with mind enjoyment) and managing to escape any awareness about The Dollhouse at all   I was able to watch it on its own merits, and pretty much without preconceptions. At least, there was a new concept there, not something that has been done, repeatedly every season and by every channel in every possible permutation since about the late 1960s or so. So mad props for an original, if rather creepy premise, of which just enough hinted at to intrigue the viewer, and not so much revealed that they can begin to pick holes in the very possibility that somewhere in Los Angeles is a secret enterprise which provides personalities to order for the very, very rich and connected, for whatever mission and purpose is required. Somehow, it has become feasible to jazzemble a personality and a specific skill set, and download them into a living human being   and then just as casually erase it all, when the mission is accomplished.In between their jazzignments, a handful of operatives, or `dolls' live in pampered luxury, their personalities and intellects on the level of about a well mannered four year old. They are overseen by their guardian handlers, a mysterious executive level manager with a chipped gljazz English accent, and a matched set of doctors   a woman with a mysterious facial scar, and a brilliant but socially inept technician who appears to know everything in the world about how to load human soft wear into the human brain. Added to that is the driven FBI agent, searching for a one of the `dollhouse' inhabitants, circling Javert like in the mean streets and offices ... and there you might think is the series: kind of a Mission Impossible, but with new minds downloaded into the same old bodies, and the same old same old plot, week in and week out. But along about the fifth episode, the story arc begins to kick in noticeably, and the viewer observes the odd coincidences, the unexpected twists and turns, and the fact that most of the on going characters are actually rather complicated and intriguing personalities, the sense that there is something more going on than just what is necessary to keep the plot o the week turning. One of the things which struck me, is that the actors playing the handful of `dolls' must absolutely relish the chance to be a radical new character, each time they are sent out. They have completely different mannerisms, turns of speech and skills, each time; as if they are reacting to a world of color, from the bland black and white inside the `Dollhouse'.",Eventually Rather Absorbing,1269043200,"03 20, 2010"

"A Black man who hangs in front of a liquor store gets killed.  A Latino in a car gets killed by a white guy.The Black guy's case reminds me a bit of the tragic Jeffrey Dahmer murders.  Dahmer killed a Laotian boy whose brother he molested years earlier.  Here, the Black man is killed by the same man who put him in a wheelchair.  On tape, they show the Black man refusing treatment when a bullet grazed his body.  If he had sought treatment, maybe he would have no longer been in the murderer's sight and would have lived.  This may be a lesson to those who fear hospitals and taking care of themselves medically.The other case involved a Latino guy, a white woman, and a white dude.  When one officer states that he suspects prostitution may be an underlying matter here, his white female colleague responds, ""A white guy and a Hispanic fighting!?  It had to involve heroin!""  It turns out she was right.  However, I don't understand how the race and gender of the combatants were a signal of that.  The white guy actually ended up being chivalrous: he tried to take all the blame so that his female partner wouldn't be punished.  However, his female partner easily cracked.  It didn't take but a second for her to start crying and admit that this was a robbery gone wrong.  I don't know why folk on this show are crazy enough to steal from dealers, but this isn't the first time it's happened.One police officer is a chunky, Latino guy and it was funny to me that his last name was Osorio when ""oso"" in Spanish means ""bear.""  The white murder suspect says something shocking.  First, he said, ""Could I face the death penalty?"" and then he says, ""May I please face the death penalty?""

"""Why Stop Now"" is a comedy drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life changing adventure.  Piano prodigy Eli Bloom (Jesse Eisenberg) is on his way to the most important audition of his life, but first he has to drop off his mother, Penny (Melissa Leo), at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted, mother and son end up at the door of her dealer, Sprinkles (Tracy Morgan).

"The fifth season of ""Sons of Anarchy"" is amazing. It continues throwing new obstacles at the characters as they attempt to resolve their problems. There may have to be a bit of suspension of belief that things work as they do, but they do work. Jax has critical decisions to make, and is he turning into the step father he despises? Opie makes critical decisions about what he can do for the club. The results of this are shocking and help guide the continuing storyline. We see sympathy when Tig rescues a defeated fighter dog, and that sympathy follows us as Tig faces more challenges. We see the heartache of Tig watching a most horrific event sees a daughter murdered.Tara makes moves to solve her family problems only to see them become more complicated than before. This all leads to a suspenseful conclusion where the fates of Clay and Tara hang in the balance. This show continues leaving viewers on the edge. This is one of the most creatively constructed shows in history. Viewers should note that many scenes are violent. The heroes are criminal killers. Yet we see the humanity in these characters, and it makes viewers hope they find their way out of their dilemmas.",An Amazing Series,1378252800,"09 4, 2013"

"Like many other long time X Fans, I'm afraid I found this one an immense disappointment. I know it's easy to fall into hyperbole, but in all honesty, this may well be the single most boring cartoon I've ever seen.On the plus side, on a purely technical level the animation is superb. About as subtle as a tattoo of a flaming skull, but technically superb. Oh, and almost all of the chicks are drawn with giant racks, too. And when I say ""giant"", I really do mean giant. The kind that in the real world could only be achieved with truly industrial quantities of silicone.Actually, aside from the fact that everyone keeps their clothes on, the style of animation here is very much in the mould of high budget R rated anime. I'm not just talking about the spandex clad chests   there's also the splatter and the gore. Measured purely in terms of screen time, the amount of violence in this show is probably about the same as you'd find in any other superhero cartoon. However, the feel and the texture of that violence is very different from what many viewers will be used to. There's something positively gratuitous about the way it's drawn. Indeed, it could almost be described as erotic... If that's your thing.And yet, despite all the violence and the chicks with the giant racks, the truth is that this has to be one of the most profoundly boring pieces of television I've ever seen. The problem is... Well, let me explain with a story.I remember back when I was about seven years old and I thought Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made. I also thought that because the best parts of Star Wars were the space battles, wouldn't Star Wars be even better if it was just one long space battle?Of course, I now know that it simply doesn't work that way. However technically impressive, however visually awe inspiring, those climactic battles only mean something when we're emotionally invested in the characters. If we fundamentally just don't care about Luke Skywalker or the world he inhabits, we also won't care that much when   or indeed if   he blows up the Death Star. The special effects are reduced to being _just_ special effects. An impressive technical achievement to be sure, but nothing more than that.Unfortunately, that's the way it is with this show.In this series, in place of real character development all we get are emotional histrionics. In place of real storytelling, scenes of gratuitous violence are interspersed with lengthy and turgid exposition. And in those very rare, brief moments when things aren't gratuitously violent, histrionic, or even turgid, everyone suddenly becomes inanely bright and cheery for no apparent reason.The honest truth is that at no point did I find myself caring about the characters in this story even the tiniest little bit. The animators could have drawn us an episode in which every single one was fed slowly into a meat grinder and it'd barely have rated a yawn.Frankly, I would just have found it as unutterably boring as every other episode in the series.Theo.",Like A Porno Film Without The Actual Porn,1332374400,"03 22, 2012"

"I have to admire the guts and Moxie of these guys but if I had to spell ""Bama Gold Miners"" in one word it would be ignorant. Ignorant is not the same as stupid. Ignorant means lacking knowledge or education and the way these boys got into this adventure sure shows it. It doesn't appear that they had a clear plan of action or a sense of team structure.  Many of their decisions turned out to be just plain unworkable and the lack of repair parts and tools indicates a lack of planning.  Also, walking barefoot through the jungle with a large cut on the bottom of the foot just shows a lack of common sense. Although this show is obviously contrived and puts me in a place where I can't suspend disbelief I still found it interesting. Along with the miners and the film crew there obviously was a large support crew to help them out.  I can't understand how they could build all of the buildings they had on site without a large crew of carpenters to build the buildings, boardwalks, etc. and electricians to wire up and electrify the camp. Although each of the guys only made about $2,000, I hope the pay from the producers added to the gold value was enough to get them by. Since there is a Season Two it appears that things went well enough to induce the team to try again. I hope they are successful because they are now less ignorant due to the knowledge they have gained based on their experiences in Season One.",How do you spell Bama gold miners?,1392422400,"02 15, 2014"

"Not willing to let a good thing simply just be, some writers and directors strive for greater relevance.  For them it isn&#8217;t good enough to craft a film about, say, spousal abuse; rather, they strive to craft &#8220;the most didactic piece of art about the horrors of spousal abuse&#8221; when just being about spousal abuse might really be enough, might really say everything that could, should, and would be said about the topic.  Leave well enough alone.  Don&#8217;t try to lace the plot with greater metaphors.  Don&#8217;t try to enamor the feature with probative images.  Figure out what works best in the story, and then drive it home.  At the end of day, everyone will appreciate the work more for staying true to the cause than they will being abused, amused, and confused with theatrical pomp and circumstance.That&#8217;s a lesson the makers and shakers behind DARK TOUCH probably should have heeded.  Instead, they&#8217;ve produced a film about keeping secrets that, while impeccably jazzembled, feels a bit too impersonal for the subject matter.  Or maybe that&#8217;s just me &#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)11 year old Neve (played with solid conviction by the young Miss Keating) has suffered the worst night of her short life &#8230; or has she?  After witnessing the bloody mjazzacre of her parents and infant brother, she&#8217;s taken in by her friendly neighbors while the police conduct their investigation.  However, when it becomes clear that Neve&#8217;s trouble may not have only just begun but also may be following her around, everyone begins to doubt the young girl&#8217;s version of events, and that very well may spell the town&#8217;s unimagined doom.Here&#8217;s the thing: without spoiling it, audiences are given a very clear idea of just who exactly the culprit is in DARK TOUCH from the very beginning.  No, I won&#8217;t ruin it; I&#8217;ll only encourage you to be watching closely from the first scenes, and, like me, you&#8217;ll probably see very much of this one coming.  That isn&#8217;t to say that the film is predictable; I don&#8217;t think it is, but I do think that this idea has been explored before.  Is Neve truly a &#8216;bad seed&#8217;?  That&#8217;s the conceit the filmmakers juggle perhaps too often in bringing this particular story to life.What works here is the young, affable, doe eyed Missy Keating.  At such an impressionable age, it&#8217;s remarkable how this actress manages to hoist the weight of the film &#8211; all of its ideas, scenes, trickery, and twists &#8211; on her capable shoulders.  She effortlessly leads viewers to see one thing while perhaps suspecting another, and, so long as the script allows, she keeps you guessing quite probably up until the last futile images are committed to celluloid.  And, sure, the players chosen to surround her all turn in some quality work, but theirs is inconsequential (in more ways that I&#8217;ll disclose in this review) when compared against the burden Keating carries consistently.What doesn&#8217;t work is the ever present tug of war writer director Marina de Van weaves around the audience.  While her film remains at all times stylish in frame and texture, the script tries all too often to pull viewers when it should&#8217;ve pushed &#8230; or, better yet, let them make up their own mind on what&#8217;s happened and how this particular world all came to be.  Because of the Herculean effort put into keeping the final secret just out of reach, I thought it was very easy to see past the misdirects and, instead, see most of this one coming a mile away.  (Make that two miles away!)  Perhaps a script penned with greater nuance and not so much deliberate obfuscation would&#8217;ve worked better or more satisfyingly.DARK TOUCH [2013] is produced by Element Pictures, Eurimages, Ex Nihilo, Film I Vast, Filmgate Films, and the Irish Film Board.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group through IFC Midnight.  As for the technical specifications &#8230; wow!  As I tried to be clear above, this is an immaculately well produced film with the highest quality sight and sound lending themselves to the exploration of this nightmare.  Indeed, the picture is ripe with some of the most impressive horror cinematography of the last year; I just wish the story could&#8217;ve left out some of the layers.  Sadly &#8211; a huge miss &#8211; there are no special features to speak of, except the relatively predictable theatrical trailer.  Boo!RECOMMENDED but more than a bit frustrating.  At its core, I&#8217;m not entirely convinced I know what happened in DARK TOUCH.  I get that it&#8217;s try very, very hard to be a horror film &#8220;about&#8221; something greater than just the pursuit of horror, but I&#8217;m amiss at exactly what that is.  We all have demons.  We all have things that have happened that might cause us some grief, trauma, or pain &#8230; but not all of us develop psychic powers as a result of them.  Instead of staying true to that central intent (i.e. be relevant), DARK TOUCH has to give in to the path of least resistance in the last act and, essentially, serve up the usual terrorizing trickery; at that point, I figured I must&#8217;ve missed it.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD copy of DARK TOUCH by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",DARK TOUCH Wants Very Much To Be About Something.

"NO SPOILERS:Not much of a challenge to avoid given up spoilers after a pilot episode where not much happened.Billed as different world only 25 miles from NYC.  Starring Jason Momoa (Game of Thrones), Martin Henderson, Julianne Nicholson (Boardwalk Empire) and Tom Sizemore (Black Hawk Down, Pearl Harbor et al).The show opens with a prodigal son Phillip (Jason Momoa) returning to the ""res"" from...(not exactly sure where, though he was in jail at some point), a search for a missing college student that was on Indian lands for a reason TBD, a cop whose older daughter is hooking with an Indian boy and wife who is a recovering alcoholic with possibly a side order of psychosis.  Tom Sizemore is apparently some form of criminal who is also Phillip's father (his mother is an African American Indian mix?)While perhaps the goal of the pilot was to set things up, IMHO it is a real risk to open a new dramatic series with virtually no palpable tension or a single moment to elevate the heart rate.  What this means is that there is a lot to get done in the next 5 episodes to not only make The Red Road watchable, but to live up to the advance hype.There are not reviews in for a representative Metacritic's score, though the 2 reviews are both extremely positive with each scoring The Red Road with an 80, which would place the program in the same general area of season 2 of House of Cards.

"The film industry owes a large debt to ""The Blair Witch Project."" That seminal idea, of a fake documentary, has launched other movies with various degrees of critical and box office success. This new entry is mostly successful.Here's the scoop. A three person college film crew is on the tail of, what they think, is a bear poacher. It turns out said poacher is actually a Troll Hunter. They accompany him on his day to day and learn a lot (maybe more than they hoped) about Trolls.This is generally a cool outing. The documentary style is played very well. The viewer gets the feeling he's there with the crew, viewing things as they happen. You like these people. The students are young and energetic. They want to get their story and are overjoyed when it turns out to be bigger than they expected. Even when things get hairy they stick with it. And the hunter is something himself. He's weary (which is why he lets them tag along) and might just want to get all this over with. He's been doing it too long. He's ""on"" all the time. No home base. No days off. No vacations. Just the day in, day out drudgery. The story unfolds at an even pace and it makes sense given the circumstances. Being that the viewer enters things at the same time as the students they learn all about Trolls, and their dealings, at the same time. There are some good high tension scenes and a bit of comic relief to keep things from getting too heavy.My only gripe in all this are the Trolls themselves. There faces look as though they came out of a Jim Henson movie. It kills the whole sense of reality established during the rest of the film. Other than that the effects are good.

She feels the same about him but they must hide their feelings.

"This just won an emmy and that finally provoked me into watching it. Before this, a series based on this burly stand up comic simply did not entice me. It has taken a few episodes for me to warm up to this but I must admit that he hits at least one big essential truth in each episode. The comedy is dark.  He is less likely to have a good relationship than Jerry Seinfeld as his stand up series character, which is saying something.In this first episode the woman he is currently seeing figures out he wants to break up and basically does all the hard work for him. As she keeps doing everything for him, you realize how inept he is at relationships. Then in other episodes we see him make behavioral zig zags just because someone says he might be gay.  He isn't but he talks in his stand up comedy act about how straight men will go to almost any lengths to prove they are not gay whereas women could care less about whether someone thinks they are a lesbian.  He makes his case very believably and I did not previously realize how true this was.His daughters ask why he doesn't have a girlfriend and very shortly he is scouting for a girlfriend he can introduce them to at a dinner.  He ends up with a bookstore owner who on the first date proves to be the craziest woman he has every dated.

"In the wasteland that is television and most ""entertainment media"" there are fewer and fewer really shining stars.  We are left with two masterpieces of darkly comedic drama.  Dexter is one and deserves its own review.Breaking Bad is the apex of adrenaline pumping cliff hangers, with every real life adventure possible built in.  It outshines and pales anything else on TV, with the exception of Dexter.Breaking Bad is built on a plausability factor that works in the real world, if at its most extreme.It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well, no doubt, as all plots to come.I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering ""My God, that was good!""If they were to produce 26, or even 52 episodes per season, it wouldn't be enough.  Vince Gilligan, Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out, make me furious, and leave me feeling compjazzion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode...Though fewer, as the series intensifies, there are also incredible laughs to be found.Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves, but know, could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment!  I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning, it is the only place to start.  Buy season one, and just keep going!

"Warning: spoilers.  Young women are kidnapped and forced to fight each other to the death for the entertainment of others.  You've very likely seen this story done before  but never with the ill advised seriousness on display here.  Raze is filmed and scored with all the lightness and humor of a holocaust film  which pretty much drains every ounce of entertainment value from the pulpy material.The movie makes a fatal mistake almost immediately: At the start it appears that actress Rachel Nichols will be the lead, but the filmmakers pull a bait and switch  she is killed in the first fight and Zoe Bell becomes the lead character.  The problem?  While Bell, who was Uma Thurman's stunt double on the Kill Bill films, acquits herself about as well as you would expect during the fight sequences the more emotional scenes are far beyond her abilities, making it impossible to care one way or another what happens to her.  The filmmakers would have been much better off using Rachel Nichols as the lead and Zoe Bell as the villain  that way she could still do her thing in the fight scenes without killing the rest of the movie.The fight scenes are brutal but they become repetitive and dull very quickly.The only entertainment value in the entire movie is oddball character actor Doug Jones, who plays the L Ron Hubbard like cult leader who is behind the fights.  During the film's one and only truly effective scene a number of the woman are strapped down to school desks while he explains the higher purpose behind what they are doing.  Unfortunately, Jones isn't given much to play with beyond that one scene.Raze will undoubtedly appeal to people who like to see women beat the crap out of each other and require nothing more.

That's what the voting is for NOT if you agree or disagree with the reviewer. If you disagree write a review. The comments section IS for those who want to disagree.The second season of ""Heroes"" stumbled with its story arc involving Hiro traveling back in time to feudal Japan. FYI, that subplot IS tied into the main plot of the second season. The focus here is on the Shanti Virus a concoction that can take away someone's powers but IS often lethal. There is also someone targeting those who were involved in the founding of ""The Company"". As with ""Lost"" the introduction of new characters was problematic  fans were more interested in finding out what happened to their favorites from season one. The show recovers somewhat by midset unfortunately the show was interrrupted by the Writer's Guild strike. I have no doubt that the second half of the second season would have made up for the stumbling start of season two based on what we find out in the extras but that didn't happen.The show looks extremely good in its DVD presentation. The extras are quite good as well which does make up for the diminished quality of the show. We get 11 commentary tracks.

"Summary:  A group of 100 kids comprised solely of criminals are sent to the earth to see if it is survivable.The premise is really interesting.  It is really cool that a bunch of kids are sent down to see if the earth is survivable.  It stays cool as long as you don't think about it too hard.Darn, I started thinking.  While this is a cool setup for a start of a new series, the problems with this premise abound.Let us start out with the very initial part of the premise, the space stations.  There was a deliberate vagueness about how the people came to be in the space stations.  If it was done on purpose, they would have laid in an adequate supply of back up parts.  They would have also provided ships with sufficient fuel to ferry the survivors back to the planet.  All of these supplies would have taken up a lot of room, which would limit the number of people allowed on the ship.  There was every indication that people would have been sent purposefully to the arks, since food, medicine, and other essential supplies would have run out long ago.  Another interesting aspect was reproduction and old age.  Reproduction was vaguely touched upon.  It was obvious that each family was limited to one child.  It was also obvious that due to a limitation of supplies that a sick child or a child born with a genetic anomaly would not be allowed to live.  What wasn't so obvious was that these parents could not be allowed to further reproduce.  In a closed system, any genetic mutations could have serious repercussions for the system as a whole.  It was also obvious that adults would have an expiration date.  Old age is a suck on resources just like illness.  The reality is that they could have spent a little more time on the ship, and this would have been a much cooler story.There were also problems that were not touched upon.  Let us start with gravity. Artificial gravity fields take a lot of power to create, and since they do want to return to earth, they would have to make fields that were comparable to earth.  Also, it would be essentially for bone development and growth in their children.  Radiation would also be a problem.  What protects the earth from ionizing and nonionizing radiation that is present in space?  Can you say ozone layer.  While there would be some protection rendered because the ark is still in the upper atmosphere.  The ozone layer would be unlikely to afford much protection because the space stations would be outside of it.  No protection from the ozone means that this people are daily exposed to radiation from the sun and space.  They would have been more protected on the earth in a hole in the ground.  While these arks are a cool idea, they have a lot of limitations.  You can see why they would want to be vague about living in an ark in space.We find out that this mission is essential to jazzess the feasibility of returning to earth.  If the earth isn't survivable, the leadership on the ark will have to make decisions about who will be culled killed so that the ark will still be able to support life.  Hmmm.... their decision is to send a bunch of kids who are largely comprised of untrained criminals.  They send no supplies with them and no means of communication.  That is such an excellent idea (sarcasm font).  They are provided no Geiger counters or meters to measure ionizing radiation.  Just because you aren't immediately losing your hair doesn't mean the radiation levels are safe.  They have no food and no weapons, and they have no immediate means of acquiring them.  They are directed to an old bunker, but after 97 years, there is no way to ascertain if the supplies are still viable, accessible, or even present.  Let's be honest, only in fiction would you send a team that is untrained and doesn't have the best interests of their community as a motivator to succeed on a mission.  This scenario lacks plausibility.  The show is designed to appeal to young viewers.  It is not designed to be plausible.  It is also designed to have many opportunities for young angst.The question you have to ask yourself is did the show have to be so stupid just to appeal to young viewers.  Ultimately, the answer would be no.  They knew that they had an insufficient number of pods for the population.  This would immediately remove the right of anyone over reproductive age of going, so this would make the cut off probably around 35.  That would really be tough, but here comes the tougher part, the really young would also not be able to go.  If you are in a hostile land, small, crying children would be very dangerous.  This would make it unlikely that anyone 5 or under would be going.  It would also be likely that their parents would not be going as well due to their unwillingness to leave their small children.  And there is your 1200 people.They could have still had young people in the initial party, but they wanted to set up a scenario where there was a lot of mayhem.Here is the problem, mayhem and angst will only take a show so far, especially a show like this.  After a while, it starts to fizzle because you will only be left with the same mayhem and angst, and warring with the natives gets old fast.So they landed with no food, weapons, or helpful technology into a hostile world that appears to be rife with mutations.  Umm... if there were this many mutations in just a hundred years, it is likely that there is still a LOT of radiation.  Also, if mammals like deer are mutated, you would also be seeing mutations in humans.  You would also be seeing a LOT of new viruses and bacteria to which the little ark kids would have no immunity.  Oops, just another thing that was not addressed.Maybe the writers will be able to come up with a lot of new exciting scenarios to keep their audience transfixed, but honestly, I was starting to get very bored of the show.  By the time it had ended this season, it held no more excitement than the pilgrims coming to America and trying to survive.  And truly, the reason outlined for the fighting just felt forced.  Your ship killed some of our people.  I also am getting really tired of their romantic angst.",Hope they can introduce an exciting element for next season...because this was getting boring,1404604800,"07 6, 2014"
"The Glades, here and gone. Given, it's not as if the world were clamoring for more cop procedural shows. But, A&E;, did you have to cut the throat without resolving the Season 4 cliffhanger ending? And, okay, given, ain't much that's original about The Glades. Oh, the setting is sumptuous. Florida always did provide the lush, sun drenched visuals. But the formulaic mystery of the week certainly wasn't the gravitating element. The primary hook was Matt Pjazzmore, an Aussie affecting a credible Yank accent. He played Jim Longworth, formerly Chicago PD except he had to beat feet out of the Windy City, scandal in his wake, the captain's bullet in his butt.His fresh start is the fictional Palm Glade, FL. And he's still solving homicides, this time under the auspices of the FDLE (Florida Dept. of Law Enforcement). The premiere episode started off trite, ended up like gangbusters in the sense that it dropped a really tasty twist that made me want to see the second and third and fourth episode. But, no lie, watching the first few minutes of episode one, I wasn't feelin' it. Jim Longworth came off as smirky and snarky and obnoxious, and it took a minute to warm up to him. But his supporting cast had flavor, from his laid back forensic pathologist pal Carlos (Carlos Gomez) to the smart and sjazzy nurse single mom Callie (Kiele Sanchez) whom Longworth runs into and right away fancies.The crackling chemistry between Kiele and Pjazzmore is the engine that drives the show. The impression Longworth leaves is that he's this self contained dude, so it was nice to see him sort of obsessing over someone. You get the sense that Kiele Sanchez is a very capable actress who's likeable in whatever role she sinks her teeth into. Her Callie is a strong woman. She's not averse to putting Longworth in the friend zone. Her scruples won't allow her to push it beyond that. Callie's husband is currently in stir, and, as she confides to Longworth, she doesn't want to be one of those women who divorced their husbands while they were in prison. So, me, I was blas&eacute; about the corpse of the week. What I craved   and eventually got   was more development between Longworth and Callie.The Glades exudes a whiff of Carl Hiaasen. It's like CSI: Miami less the concentration on forensics and the wardrobe is a wee bit more relaxed. When Longworth and Callie aren't bringing the sizzle, the show is smart enough to partner Longworth up with Carlos, and their amusing interplay is always fun to watch. For me, one detracting element is young Uriah Shelton who plays Callie's 12 year old son. I'm trying not to blame the actor as I think it's the scripts that call for him to be bratty and vexing. Jeff is really the main obstacle to Longworth and Callie's taking it to the next level. The kid pines for his incarcerated dad to get with his mom again. This whole mess is a running sub plot thru most of the life of the series.My favorite Season 1 eps:  ""Pilot"" for that very unexpected twist  ""A Perfect Storm"" in which Longworth must solve a killing spree and attend a high school reunion (not his own) as a hurricane slams into Palm Glade  ""Honey"" mostly for Longworth's temporary partner, the muy sexy tribal police officer, Josie Tigertail (Morgan Hewitt)Ultimately, whether you're down with The Glades depends on your take on Matt Pjazzmore. Yes, his character is maddening and brash and frequently so callous. Longworth does possess mad investigative skills, but he's a maverick. His method of choice is pretty much poking that beehive to get a reaction. Longworth's saving grace, what makes him finally sympathetic, is that he genuinely cares for Callie. And everything goes from there. The Glades isn't the best crime drama. But I like its quirk and I really like the girl and I like eyeballing the bright splash of Floridian backdrop. But, man, that Season 4 cliffhanger kills me. We'll never know. It's like Now & Again, Space: Above & Beyond, the 1990's Spider Man cartoon, and Popular all over again.

"I wasn't thrilled by the movie. The dialogue needs a lot of work. It just wasn't that funny. The family was too much. I can't imagine the dad being unemployed six months, hiding it from his wife, being so broke and still going on vacation. I might be able to believe a shorter length of time unemployed and hiding it. But the dad didn't understand GPS yet could pull off hiding six months unemployment? The mom was the smart one yet she had no idea the finances of her family before a major vacation? She had no idea for 6 months her husband had no job and wasn't paying the bills off? The daughter wasn't even likable. I just didn't get this family and couldn't care about them or relate to any of them. I wouldn't pay to see this. I do think it may be tweakable though. Someone mention a budget Hawaiian vacation. I could see this being pulled off with the dad coming clean about where they are with his unemployment and finances. Then a budget vacation maybe being planned by mom and dad for the kids, who had been promised a trip to Hawaii. Once there, the dad gets caught up in the adventure of the stolen statue. It would be possible to make something from that but characters would need makeovers. Dad could be slightly more aware of technology like GPS, knows about it but is not really tech savvy so he bungles it. Mom could be a bit more savvy on the families finances but loves Dad enough to hide his unemployment and their financial state for one last hurrah for the children.

Sell a lot of books this way, do you? By insulting an honest reviewer, then demanding back up evidence? This is a REVIEW, not a doctoral thesis. The idiots who made this film have the burden   not I. Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU. And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of ""black"" names, not I. And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let down; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book. I've come to the conclusion that the appellation ""rogue economist"" (as Levitt calls himself) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia, the documentary's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments. Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word, stupid. Or, in another word, Wallywood. So here are the basic parts of this broken machine:REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS: Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home selling scheme. While I found it informative, it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN'S NAMES: This is about whether a child's name will affect that child's success later in life. It seems Levitt's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper's life. I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs. I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is. In any case, I do not need statistics to explain that to me: I am half black.However, Levitt (the apparent heavy lifter in all the fact finding) tells us more: did you know that among rich white folk, the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica, Lauren, Ashley, Sarah and Emily? Among ""the Wal~Mart crowd"" (their term, not mine), the most popular names were Ashley (""Trashley""), Jessica, Amanda, Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice versa, but there you are. Apparently, these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone ""is a black name."" I have news for you: it is not a ""black"" name. The only thing in the world that is ""black"" in this context is the skin of some people. And that's not ""black"", it's ""brown"".Gee, I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED: Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan. Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence. It's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion. This was a good segment, but a totally confusing mish mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture   which this documentary jazzumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES: These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates. How's that?   you may well ask. Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you have to have a baby NOW laws from circa 1989. Levitt found that about 20 years later, Romanian crime had skyrocketed. Coincidence?Based on this interestingly weak observation, Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. He claims he found crime had plummeted. Levitt jazzerts 50% of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals to be that were never born. Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use: Levitt freely jazzerts 50% of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade. He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that jazzertion.What is freely jazzerted is freely negated   any critics of my review familiar with THAT? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns, well, I don't have to do so. The burden is Levitt's. And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES: For me this was the most stupid segment: an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades. The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork. As opposed to getting out on the street, joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me. It is the usual pseudo intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia', and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts. Naturally, it deeply moves pseudo intellectuals. This film tries to be light hearted and humorous, but it falls flat.These ""experts"" are offensive idiots: they manage to insult the poor of all colors (is that funny?), the black community (oh, that MUST be funny), struggling parents (definitely not funny and most unwise) AND kids in dire need (just plain horrible and psycho). We can safely add that the authors film narrators in some odd way have made pro abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors' book. Since I have a little bird who tells me things, I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner ""read reviews"". Well, gentlemen, I hope you learned something from my review. The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms. Apparently, some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know: my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary.","These are serious subjects, not a clown show",1326412800,"01 13, 2012"

"Having worked in the animation industry as a composer for 30 years, and more recently as a writer of children's programing, here are my thoughts.The LookIt has a home HD quality to it. I&#8217;m not sure why. The camera lighting angles? The framing? The color correction saturation?The ConceptNot at all well established. The name &#8220;Maker Shack Agency&#8221; is not a compelling title and gives no strong clues as to what the show is about without reading the log line. It would have been better to start with the expositional main title sequence showing the boys in the midst of successes and failures with blue flame explosions and fumes pouring out their garage doors   then cut to the cafeteria.Think &#8220;Phil of the Future&#8221; as a model. Along with this, the main title song&#8217;s outlining what&#8217;s to come as well as establishing the character&#8217;s relationships would have gone a long way to set the context and sustain the opening of the show.The CurriculumA science show for sure but, the underpinnings are more intended to be humorous than inspirational, if barely functional. I&#8217;m never in favor of base potty jokes, so their &#8220;fart detector&#8221; was a demographically marketable add on for me.On the other hand, imagine if Wolfie had very bad gas and was about to go out on a date. How much funnier it would have been for him to invent and use a &#8220;fart canceling machine&#8221; while trying to conceal the device in the car. Out of his control it would have been &#8220;farts gone wild&#8221;.His date, &#8220;Wolfie, what&#8217;s that box. Is that a new invention of yours? Oh&#8230; you are soooo smart. Can I see it? What does it DO!?&#8221;The audience would know as does Wolfie, that the instant he loses control of the box a methane disaster awaits! The struggle between them and Wolfie&#8217;s lame excuses as to just why she can&#8217;t see the box would have been ripe for side gripping humor&#8211;especially if she lurches and grabs it out of his hands and fiddles with the knobs! Now theirs a scene that really stinks for you!So, the &#8220;science gone wild&#8221; was pallid for me as no invention, real or imagined solved any worldly problems. It&#8217;s &#8220;Flubber&#8221; with teens at the helm with the steering wheel missing.Plot   Story ArcIt seems as if the main plot, the Maker Shack, was the subplot. The focus was not clear as the &#8220;science&#8221; aspect was secondary to &#8220;teens revenge&#8221; themes and a preoccupation with farting. As for plot focus, think &#8220;Weird Science&#8221; for a parallel teen adventure movie.As a teen SitCom the humor that DID NOT involve farts was itself very self conscious. And though I am clearly out of THAT demographic, having been schooled by my own teenage daughters, I found the set ups predictable with a few exceptions.Then, given the obesity epidemic, I was troubled by a plot that involved a candy baron and&#8230; a candy peddler in the school&#8217;s cafeteria. That CANDY drove the storyline is a real negative in children&#8217;s media. Consider: Cookie Monster has been switched to broccoli!([...])That is certainly an indication that this is not the proper &#8220;teen sweet spot&#8221; (industry term) and is the wrong plot motivation for a teen&#8217;s show in this health conscious day and age.The CharactersFor me, the most serious problem is the lead, Wolfie, who if properly cast could have held the show more together. He lacked the over the top energy and charisma necessary to pull off some of the antics. His emotional tachometer seemed to idle at 2500 rpm throughout the show. The other characters seem more like stereotypical set pieces.The MusicIndy rock I suppose? Usually mixed WAY TOO LOW. As a backdrop to the action it was one dimensional and struggled to comment on the humor and antics.A Note on SoundPoor production sound and mic ing hurt the dialogue. The room tone was uneven and the dialogue seemed at a distance. Further, the &#8220;walla&#8221;(BKG chatter), street and cafeteria backgrounds were not handled well leaving many scenes unnaturally quiet and bare.ConclusionIn this technological hi tech age, the show never reached for the their inventions &#8220;wow factor&#8221;. It relied on more primitive wires and batteries, blinking lights and a laptop. The audience for this show will become much more interested if it can come up the something that looks like real awesome breakthroughs that gets the job done along with a boatload of clever set ups and humor.",A professional in depth review,1392854400,"02 20, 2014"

"The series is well conceived, well written, and well cast. I can nitpick a couple of things, but that is what it would be, nitpicking. At the heart of the story is the existence of the twins, Emma and Sutton.Sutton is the spoiled princess and Emma is the runaway from Nevada foster care, the pauper. Only a few persons know of the existence of the twins, and maintaining the secret of the twins is the motive force of the story. While this would not ordinarily appear to be much of a motive for all that occurs in the story, understanding the motives of all of the players helps.Ted, played by Andy Buckley, is hiding from his wife Kristin, played by Helen Slater, his identity as adopted daughter Sutton's biological father. He is also hiding this identity from the daughter played by Alexandra Chando. It is not completely clear why, but he might fear that the child would spill the beans.  Oddly, he does not know of the existence of the twin, Emma. Alec played by Adrian Pasdar, Ted's high school and lifetime chum, who plays the local District Attorney, arranged the adoption of Sutton the issue of an affair in the initial year of Ted's marriage to Kristin. When Ted learns of the birth of a daughter while his young wife is expecting and learns that the young and unprepared biological mother is placing the baby up for adoption, Alec makes arrangements for Ted to adopt his own daughter. This action is only plausible because Ted and Kristin are having trouble ""getting pregnant.""The adoption was all handled under the table. Ted only adopts one of the twins because he does not know there are twins, a secret maintained by Alec. Accordingly, after the adoption Alec's motive for keeping the secret of the existence of the twins is that not only was the adoption legally unnecessary (presumably the declared birth father could simply be given custody of the newborn), but it was illegal or at least shady as handled, bad business for a lawyer and for a District Attorney in particular. In splitting up the twins and not disclosing that there are twins, Alec has deceived his friend Ted for what in his mind are altruistic reasons. Of course disclosing the identity of Sutton's biological parents would be disastrous to Ted's marriage and could threaten Alec's legal career. Rebecca, played by Charisma Carpenter, the biological mother of the twins after seventeen years sets out to win Ted's affections and ""reunite"" the family. This setting is ripe for exploitation with lies and intrigue.The twins discover one another s existence, and the intrigue begins with the two girls switching places so that Sutton can follow up leads and find her still undiscovered biological mother. During Sutton's absence, Emma must jazzume the life of Sutton, a life of some privilege in situation and standing among Sutton's peers. As the story develops it becomes clear that twin Emma is more successful in her high school career than is even Sutton. This switch is supposed to last for only a couple of days, but it gets dragged out much longer.Alexandra Chando deserves a Golden Globe or other award for her work in this series, The Lying Game.  Chando's performance is masterful in playing the role of both identical twins, Emma Becker and Sutton Mercer. The viewer will love them both, but Emma a little more. As Sutton put it Emma is the improved version of Sutton. The Sutton character can show some spoiled meanness, but also show cute mischief. Chando appears effortlessly to move between the personality and temperament of Sutton Mercer and Emma Becker. At many places and scenes in the series, if the viewer could ""freeze frame"" Chando's nuanced facial expressions and study them, they would come to recognize what a true master of meaningful facial nuance actress Chando really is. I am not sure quite how the director handles the scenes involving both characters (although I can speculate), but even these scenes are believable. OK Chando, I concede that you may not think you are doing this effortlessly, but as long as you make it look that way you get my vote for the Golden Globe.

"As a sci fi fan I had to check this one out and usually I review after the first season is over, however I think in this case after episode 12 we have enough material to do a thorough review.Cast: 5 5  Nothing to really say here, they are all good looking, young, sexy actors who don't suck.Character Development: This is one of the main areas that the show fails for me. There is significant development in the characters, however, don't feel like the characters MATURE much.  In fact, I would say that several of them (you will know who I am talking about) who started out as mature, stable, and kind characters, devolve rather quickly into petty, arrogant, power hungry brats. Relationships are fluid, unstable, confusing, and shallow. Usually there are at least one or two characters that jump out at me and make me say ""that one is my favorite"", but this one the characters are all so ""lukewarm"" that I don't find that my interest stays glued to any particular one.Plot: This is also where I took off one star. The show keeps repeating ""We are at war"" every episode. Just to try to convince the viewers that there is supposed to be a serious plot going on, even though it's lost somewhere in translation and I just can't take the show that seriously. Every episode the ""Tomorrow People"" sit around chatting merrily and playing pool, having fun, while the leaders and the ""double agent"" are risking their lives to ...  I forgot. Yeah it's just that memorable. Even the scenes where they go ""grocery shopping"" to try to explain how they sustain their subterranean lives don't have any sense of urgency to it. Many parts of the plot are disjointed, and the ""inability to kill"" as a genetic trait is laughable. It invalidates the whole point of being at ""war"" and the plot holes such a device creates are big enough to drive a train through.Relationships: Didn't take off a star for this because as  confusing and muddled the relationships in this show are, it seems to be standard among almost all of the modern series, and so I will leave my commentary at that.Special effects CGI: Average. First time I have seen telekinesis represented as blue lightning bolt kind of blobs. Darth Vader was much more convincing and he didn't need visual aids to be scary, and the last time I checked telekinesis was not a visible power.Overall Rating: 3 5Don't expect any depth. This is an interesting show to watch but if you are hoping for something that will leave you glued to your chair biting your fingernails waiting for the next episode, this one isn't probably for you. If you want to see something averagely entertaining with an average plot with confusing contradictions and muddled relationships then this might interest you. There are many times in the show where you will do a facepalm and ask yourself ""if they could have done that in the first place, they would have!"", and this show would have been reduced to 1 episode.",Dwindling Returns,1394928000,"03 16, 2014"
"Martin, a doctoral student in mathematics, comes to Oxford hoping to snag the famous mathematician and philosopher Arthur Seldom as his doctoral thesis supervisor. He is rebuffed and humiliated. He decides to leave Oxford. As Martin enters the home of Mrs. Eagleton, from whom he rents rooms, he meets Seldom again, also entering. They both find the old lady dead in her chair. At first she seems to have died of advanced cancer. But then a small discrepancy points to clever murder.In The Oxford Murders, this odd sequence happens to two others... plausible deaths then slight signs of purposeful corpse making. Before Martin (Elijah Wood) and Seldom (John Hurt) fully realize the implications, they are joined together in a search for the serial murderer. One thing they realize soon: The murderer is almost as clever a mathematician as they are. And math, as it was nearly for me in high school, can be the death of a person.Here's what I mean: The theory of logical series, Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico Philosophicus, Bormat's (read Fermat's) Last Theorem and, of course, the divine number. Eventually we learn the truth...and a clever, twisted truth it is. For a good deal of the movie I didn't have any idea what Professor Seldom and Martin were talking about. Still, I enjoyed the movie much more than I thought I would. ""In real life,"" says Seldom, ""any decision has irreversible consequences."" I decided to watch and now I have a movie I learned to like.I liked The Oxford Murders particularly because the dialogue was dense. (A couple of skin scenes weren't bad either.) The audience was expected to keep up even if people weren't sure what they were trying to keep up with. There was a presumption of at least some intelligence, with numbers, symbols, verbal illustrations and philosophical questions for us to play with. Some might call this boring. I got lost within 15 minutes, but enjoyed every minute in the maze. Much of that pleasure was watching and listening to that extraordinary actor, John Hurt, with bags under his eyes as big as satchels and a face as wrinkled as a corrugated cardboard box. Elijah Wood was quite good, too, with those big, transparent blue eyes as weird as marbles.Two other actors stand out in relatively small roles. Anna Mjazzey is both sad and unlikable as Mrs. Eagleton. Dominique Pinon is notable as the father of a child who may die of cancer.Says Professor Seldom, ""Since man is incapable of reconciling mind and matter, he tends to confer some sort of entity on ideas because he cannot bear the notion that the purely abstract only exists in our brain. The beauty and harmony of a snowflake, the butterfly that flutters its wings and causes a hurricane on the other side of the world. We've been hearing about that darn butterfly for decades but who has been able to predict a single hurricane? Nobody! Tell me something. Where is the beauty and harmony in cancer? What makes a cell suddenly decide to turn itself into a killer metastasis and destroy the rest of the cells in a healthy body? Does anybody know? No! Because we'd rather think of snowflakes and butterflies. Or Pain? War? So why? Because we need to think that life has meaning. That everything is governed by logic and not by mere chance. If I write 2, then 4, then 6, we feel good because we know that next comes 8. We can foresee it. We are not in the hands of destiny. Unfortunately however, this has nothing to do with truth. Don't you agree? This is only fear. Sad."" You won't find this level of dialogue in movies about monkeys.In a happier mood, Professor Seldom also says this, ""The only perfect crime that exists is not the one that remains unsolved, but the one which is solved with the wrong culprit.""I liked this movie. Not many people did.","""We have an absolute truth: Everything is fake.""",1316995200,"09 26, 2011"

"Let's get the Blu ray business out of the way.  As you might expect, the film looks great.  Director Takashi Miike uses the camera to show great views of the mountainous Japanese landscape.  The small villages look authentic.  The sound is in both Dolby Digital HD and DTS HD so take your pick.  Both are fine but nothing special.  I was a bit surprised that for an action oriented film like this, we wouldn't get more from the surrounds.  Still, clear and focused.  Special features include deleted scenes, an interview with the director and a trailer.The film takes place in 1844 toward the end of the Japanese feudal era.  An evil...and I do mean evil...lord is about to ascend to power.  While he is despised by nearly everyone including his closest protectors, it is the way of life to serve the master cljazz.  A small group of samurai are called upon to kill him.  The leader of the samurai is Shinzaemon Shimada (Koji Yakusho).  He is reluctant to mutiny until he hears and sees evidence for himself.  In a ghastly scene, a nude teenage girl is presented to him.  Her limbs had been severed and her tongue cut out by the evil butcher.  Shinzaemon accepts the jazzignment.The first half of the film deals with the gathering of samurai warriors and their preparation to intercept the evil Lord Naritsugu as he travels to accept his Shogun promotion.  The small group of 12 encounters the 13th jazzjazzin in the forest, a peasant who is adept at stealth movement and with the use of a slingshot. He joins the band.  They are a mixture of seasoned samurai looking for one last fight and young men looking for acceptance.  While the photography is beautiful and the acting is fine, this is pretty standard stuff.  What comes next isn't.Expecting to encounter an army of about 70 soldiers guarding the lord, it turns out to be more like 200 as the lord has called in reinforcements.  In a calculated retreat, the samurai build up a ramshackle village they come across, setting numerous traps as they await the onslaught of the lord and his loyalists.  Once the battle begins it goes on for 45 minutes or so which must be some kind of record for a film.  This is not kung fu fighting or aerial ballet.  This is visceral, samurai sword fighting.  It is brutal but artistic, violent but resplendent and smartly choreographed.  We're talking about scores of combatants going at it and it all looks seamless.  The 13 extend the battle, not only because of their fearlessness and expert swordsmanship but because they had set traps to encapture the enemy in smaller groups.  This remake of Eiichi Kudo's 1963 film starts out a bit slow and predictable, but ends with one of the great hand to hand combat movies around.",3 1/2 stars for a brutal combat film,1324512000,"12 22, 2011"

"In all honesty, if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door, I'm going to shoot my television.  I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.

I think that it's a concept with GREAT potential.However, there's NO WAY that a whole TV show can be produced in quality stop motion animation. It'll either have to be crappy stop motion animation, or they'll do us and themselves a favor by abandoning stop motion animation.The show's best bet would be to go with some type of computer animation. I would suggest avoiding 3 D animation, since that looks too unintentionally cartoonish, and too typical for something SciFi ish. It could be awesome if they embraced a Southpark style cutout computer animation. That would provide some comedic dissonance for the SciFi theme, but still have the adult flare that the show seems to be striving for.",Lose the stop motion animation and you may have a winner,1367107200,"04 28, 2013"

Go Steelers or whatever! Sports! Manly things! Basically I'm a walking stereotype with little or no inner life. Check out my muscles!""Everyone in the office has to eventually sleep with someone else in the office. It's practically the law on this series. Bones and Booth are a boring pair. Emily Deschanel cannot force her body language or facial muscles into fooling the camera into thinking she is even remotely excited to be around Boreanaz's character. Even if she could, her character has been painted too far into a very unemotional corner. Nothing about it makes sense to me. I can see ALL the other couples on the show happening, but not those two. (Also, the wedding episode was so boring that neither of us could pay attention to the whole thing. It really stunk. A lot. Everything that makes the show worth watching was left in the dust.)The technical advising on computer internet related things is really bad at times. Pelant hacks the lab computers by arranging a crime scene in some mathematically significant way, probably based on an exploit from around 2005 where .jpg files could be corrupted in a certain way to cause problems. Of course, that exploit required modifying an already existing file. You can't just move stuff around in a room to cause it. Whoever researched that simply did not do their job, and then we had to groan as they wrapped us up in this giant plot hole. The Angela tron is similar: I'd believe it if the show was set in 2030, but today, all the money in the world can't make that happen. It's just not around yet.Nevertheless, the show is interesting enough, when we aren't being bombarded with blundering workplace relationships or plot holes. There is a fair amount of action and adventure. There's tension, meaningful problems are being solved (except in the pointless wedding episode), etc. And Hodgins blows stuff up sometimes. That's fun. They film outdoors in a bunch of different places so you don't feel like you're getting the same rehashed stuff all the time. If they had spent more time developing the Booth character, and if they had taken Dr. Brennan in a less ""high functioning autism"" direction, it would have been four stars. Maybe even five.","Flawed, but I keep paying for more episodes",1382400000,"10 22, 2013"

"The premise and plot line are fantastic and compelling. I want to watch another episode and find out happens next, but the characters are not likeable or realistic. Each one is some shallow combination of stereotypes and their actions are often plot driven rather than character drive. If the writers want our characters to do something or go somewhere, then it's going to happen no matter how weak the reason.So, where's the potential? The plot itself is interesting and there are a lot of interesting questions about why everything is going to hell (literally maybe?) and what our characters have to do with it. The story is peppered with little clues that a quick mind will pick up on (although not yet enough to figure anything out). The filming of the crowd scenes was very good and conveyed an emergency situation better than a lot of films I've seen.Hopefully, another episode will be filled with more character development. If that happens, this could be a great show.","Great-Potential, but not this episode isn't it. (No spoilers)",1393027200,"02 22, 2014"

"ZEN is now available on Amazon Instant View and if the opening episodes are any indication of things to come, then we have a delightful summer delicacy on hand. The series takes place in Rome and features a detective known for his integrity, a Venetian by the name of Zen (Aurelio Zen) played with understated cljazzy style by Rufus Sewell. Zen, who lives with his mother (Catherine Spaak) after his crumbled marriage is involved in defining the responsibility for some murders in the past which happen to mimic some recent murders   and in the complex process we discover that the Italian government wants to engage him on one side of the investigation while another somewhat shady source engages his for the opposite legal decision. There is plenty action and suspense and the uncovering of secrets about the house where the most recent murders took place   a mansion undermined with tunnels and caves and rapidly flowing rivers where a strange young girl Silvia (Cariddi Nardulli) hides from a society that has abused her. Zen perseveres in his intelligent search for facts, a search that happens to include some beautiful photography of the Italian countryside, a romantic interest in the form of the beautiful Tania (Caterina Morino) who is being pursued by the entire office of Zen's workplace, especially by one Vincenzo Fabri (Ed Stoppard), a team of bad buys out for vengeance against the police, and a host of other characters who suggest avenues this series may take.The cast is sterling though for the most part unexplainably British in this Italian set drama (Stanley Townsend, Ben Miles, Francesco Quinn, Anthony Higgins, Garry Cooper, Adrian Schiller and Cosima Shaw) but the key to the success of this series is the solid work by Rufus Sewell. While the winter and spring shows rest, this series deserves summer attention. Grady Harp, July 11",A New Class Act,1311552000,"07 25, 2011"

"update: ok, i've watched more episodes of this and my interest has dropped with each one. i like fox but sitting through this show is becoming excruciating so i will no longer be watching.  the biggest problem is that it is not funny and it is a sitcom.  i enjoyed him so much more in his roles on THE GOOD WIFE and RESCUE ME. he was outstanding in those. but they weren't comedies.  it is really too bad they simply didn't just do a spin off with his character from GOOD WIFE. i am dropping this to three stars.  i like him too much to give him any less.my original review follows:i've seen two episodes of this show and i would say it is promising.  it is the kind of show that needs to build its characters so it can find out which ones are working with fox.  then it needs to cut the characters who aren't working well with him. the only way to tell this is by trying them out on the audience.  fox himself is delivering but he needs to find those characters who will be the best comedy foils for him. i remember early episodes of THE MIDDLE, which is now one of my favorite shows.  there was a whole subplot with a car dealership and another with the mother's aged relatives.  those were cut and the focus tightened on the three children, husband and wife and became much, much better. presently fox has one heck of a lot of characters revolving around him. they are: a wife, three children, a sister in the same building, a network boss, a network jazzistant and an upstairs neighbor. so far my strongest positive reactions are to him with the youngest kid and his brew up sister. much as i love betsy brandt from BREAKING BAD, it will take me awhile to stop thinking of her as DEA agent hank's wife and begin thinking of her as michael j. fox's wife.fox plays a news anchor. the most successful comedies with news anchors have been played by Phil Hartmann and Ted Knight. both of these highly comedic actors made themselves the butts of all jokes though as egotistical and inept tv newsmen.  fox won't be able to play it that way, not with the strong parkinson's disease element to the show.  those two would clash horribly. he was great as the lawyer on THE GOOD WIFE and that might have been an easier profession to use.i will keep watching for now. i thin it is at least 50 50 on being able to pull it off.  however, it needs to go into another time slot.  it is up against robin williams as a comedically riffing adman.  that show is killing this show in the ratings. a show which heavily features a disease cannot go up again one of the most popular stand up comics of all time doing his thing.",not particularly funny although you like him,1380326400,"09 28, 2013"

"The 5th season of Castle did a couple things very well.  First, it brought closure to, but did not totally conclude the who killed Beckett's mother storyline.  We finally find out who was behind it all, but the door is left open for more story lines involving that person.  Secondly it finally brought Castle and Beckett together as a couple.Obviously in this kind of show there is always a danger in the series running out of steam when the couple is finally brought together.  That really did not happen this season.  Stana Kanic and Nathan Fillion have very good chemistry, and the writing around the characters did not get stale.  I also liked the fact that they did not go the predictable route and split them up shortly after getting them together.  The writers let the relationship play out over the course of the season.  There was tension in the relationship in the final few episodes, which provided a nice lead up to the cliffhanger ending.The standout episodes of the season to me were the Rear Window spoof, the two part episode where Alexis is kidnapped, the one where Castle is framed for murder, and the episode where Beckett is caught on a bomb.  That last one shows many of the great moments from the prior seasons through flashbacks.  The show also keeps up the tradition of throwing in references to Firefly, having awesome guest cameos, and overall a great mix of comedy, drama and romance.The show dos not fit into any one specific category.  Like I said above it is a blend.  It is not a comedy but is very funny at times.  It is not a straight up drama, but it does put characters you care about in dramatic situations, and there is romance but it does not dominate the show and is not cheesy.  All in all it is a well written, well acted series and definitely worth checking out. I would advise strongly against just jumping into the show this season if you have not watched the prior seasons.  While there is a story of the week element to the show, there are also multiple arcs that have played out and if you have not seen any of the previous episodes you may be lost at times.For those who do get the DVDs, there are a few bonus features.

"Let me clarify this from the get go: I'm not one of those reviewers who seeks to kick the stuffing out of `found footage' films.  All you need to do is peruse the reviews I've done here at Amazon or elsewhere to know that I'm entirely accepting of this sub genre.  I'd go so far to say that I enjoy them quite a bit so long as there is some quality story, development, and characters at the heart of whatever footage the producers allege to have found.  Granted, I do believe these flicks work best as horror upstarts, but that doesn't mean I won't appreciate a few dramatic turns here and there, and, to its credit, HOLLOW thinks it knows what it's doing in presenting four young folks   two couples, basically   enjoying a weekend outing in some romantic and spooky setting.  Unfortunately, HOLLOW should've known better.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)There's a tree on a hill in the middle of a small remote village that   rumor had it   has been haunted by a local legend ... for, in the hollow of this mjazzive, somewhat disfiguring tree, there lives a dark spirit that seeks out young lovers in the midst of some relationship strife and convinces them to commit suicide.Now, if you stop right there, I'd argue you have the makings of a possibly mystical thriller.  You have all the right elements   an evil place, an evil spirit, and an evil cause   that coulda, woulda, shoulda made for a nice picture.Unfortunately, then they made the film.Emma , a k a `the innocent one' (played by the lovely Emily Plumtree), and Scott, a k a `the alpha male' (Matt Stokoe), long for a weekend away from it all; and, hoping to share it with a few friends, they invite James, a k a `the jilted ex with a troubled past'(Sam Stockman), and Lynne, a k a `the slutty one' (Jessica Ellerby), to join them.  Emma's grandfather   the pastor for a small, country village   recently pjazzed away, and they're heading there to make use of the premises, despite the fact that it has no electricity.  Once there, they find themselves all equally creeped out by the legendary tree of local lore, and, before their weekend getaway is over, they may find out just how real and deadly folklore can be.Some `found footage films' clearly give `found footage films' a bad name, and HOLLOW is part of that growing group of flicks made clearly to capitalize on a sub genre but not provided enough spine upon which to build a perfect body.  In fact, all there is to HOLLOW is its twist ending   not all that big of a twist, and certainly one you can see coming from ten miles away.  These characters aren't given any legitimate depth   though I've read some reviewers who think the introduction of relationships and faithlessness accounts to `character development' (here's a tip: it doesn't)   and, instead, they're all archetypes plopped into a `locked box scenario' with very little hope of escaping.In that respect, much of HOLLOW works just fine.  There's a benign charm to some elements of the film   the introduction of the local church mythology surrounding the suicide tree, the fact that there exists more than ample evidence to support some paranormal phenomenon in the vicinity, etc.   that work well enough to establish the premise; however, when writer director Matthew Holt essentially delivers an ending an audience knew from their very first frame, why bother at all?  Why not, instead, give viewers a legitimate reason to hang around for 90 minutes by creating characters that mean something more than just fitting the stereotype?  These are four relatively self centered and stupid individuals who one could argue get just what they deserved for being so mind numbingly self centered and stupid.  Don't be shocked when they get their comeuppance.Sadly, a sense of `nothing new here' pervades so much of HOLLOW.HOLLOW is produced by (how fitting?) Hollow Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled through New Video.  As for the technical specifications ... well ... the video looks and sounds about as good as the next `found footage' flick, though I'm alarmed by the increasing use of a camera at night when the characters are running while essentially filming the ground.  Sound is good, but the herky jerky camera work really could've been improved.  Also, there's an awful lot of turning the camera off (to save battery near the end), but, boy, it's sure good that they turned the camera on just as something was about to happen!  (Don't give me that gobbledy gook about them ""needing the light,""either.  I didn't just fall off a truck.)  As for the special features, there's only a two minute ""story behind the scene"" wherein the director gives you his two cents about how and why they shot the ending the way they did; it's interesting, but it ain't all that special, nor much of a feature.RECOMMENDED only if found footage films are REALLY your thing because, otherwise, I'd be hard pressed to see what value one might find in HOLLOW.  It isn't that it's poorly made because, in most instances, the production quality is there.  While I wouldn't agree with some stylistic choices made, I strongly disagree with those who think there's a winning 90 minute story here because there isn't.  At best, it's a half hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out into 90 unnecessary minutes.  Once you experience the ""engrossing and effective"" ending (their advertising words, certainly not mine), perhaps you'll agree.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of HOLLOW for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","HOLLOW Is, Well, Hollow",1360540800,"02 11, 2013"

I gave the writers this season a chance and am actually surprised that this season is worse.I don't expect anyone to have the guts to change the title of the show since this is no longer The Walking Dead. This is just some very low budget bore fest using the name. The guy who created the show had guts but he apparently was the only one. Now on screen it's just a creep moping around in slow motion talking slow and oh look, now he is killing everyone and he's going to be the Governor again. Pitiful. No new ideas at all....even with all that potential. A sickness at the prison? Wow. What does it matter when there is no longer any clear reasons to live accept, like the zombies, to just keep on going? I guess the character of Carol was supposed to really embody that? Yawn.They are probably still at the prison just because of the budget but then why spend more money when people will love it whether they provide the epic ness of a cop riding into a city experiencing the ""zombie apocalypse"" on a horse or whether it's a bunch of nobodies hanging out in trailers getting picked off by the psycho? Whether it's a dynamic as hell character like Shane or whether it's some pouty faced manchild obsessed with commandeering a family. Who cares? Besides all that, if it is all about misery and degeneration then why bother? What is the point?I don't know what is worse though. The show that thinks the Governor is lead character material or reading all of these reviews of people talking themselves into thinking the show is great or those who feel that they need to respond to bad reviews and defend this mediocrity.",Pathetic.,1385424000,"11 26, 2013"

"Note to Hollywood and beyond: I've really grown tired with trick endings.  It isn't that I don't like then because, frankly, I do.  It's that most of them aren't done all that well any longer.  As a matter of fact, once you know you're trapped inside a motion picture that undoubtedly will have a trick ending (the first giveaway is that you can tell one's coming), then you begin w a t c h i n g the film yet you stop watching the story.  You find yourself glancing at shadows.  You listening for verbal clues to secret identities or dropped Easter eggs.  You're seeing that body over in the corner of the screen, and you're wondering, ""Hey, why is it the director never shows me who that dead guy is over there?""  At that point, it's stopped being a legitimately entertaining experience and started being an exercise in cognitive reasoning ... and that's not the reason I spun the disc in the first place!(NOTE: the following review will contain spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of character and plot.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're comfortable with a few hints of `things to come,' then read on ...)George (played nicely by the reliable Rupert Evans) is a down on his luck musician who   in order to make ends meet   takes a job as `chef' at the local insane asylum.  (Where did he get such a romantic background and why is it he can only find a job cooking at a virtual prison?  Ah, ah, ah!  Don't start looking so closely so soon, viewer!)  In order to make his existence a bit more palatable, he somehow manages to have all of the members of his band also hired at the said institution.  (Wait a minute ... how exactly does that happen?  Ah, ah, ah!  I warned you about thinking too much about the plot!)  But before you can say `twaddle,' a freak electric storm knocks out all power to the normally secured building (AND the back up generators?!?!), and George and his friends are left locked behind bars with time running out on their own sanity as the inmates seize control!  (Well, how in the Sam Hill is that even remotely ... FOR THE LAST TIME, DIDN'T I WARN YOU TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT?!?!)ASYLUM BLACKOUT didn't make much sense from the get go, but, to its strengths, it's certainly grounded in some solid work by all the players, a wonderfully moody atmosphere complete with all of the usual `locked box' scenarios, and some fine dark'n'gritty filmmaking.  Were that enough, I'd probably be willing to give it more than a respectable two and one half stars (most of which is solely for some solid technical and acting prowess); but, sadly, all of it revolves around a central conceit of the trick ending.  I couldn't tell you exactly when I started to suspect exactly ""What"" was going on   it's fairly predictable as a trick ending, I might add   though, based on my description of the plot, methinks you can tell it was early on.Narratively, it is structured very well.  It's a tidy 90 minutes, broken into clear thirds like a cljazzic three act play.  The first 30 minutes is set up of all the players; the second 30 is when the black out occurs and everything goes downhill fast; while the final 30 clearly begins pointing toward the ruse you'll probably see coming.  Suffice it to say, folks aren't exactly what they seem ... but the critical failure of the particular subterfuge of S. Craig Zahler and Jerome Fansten's script is that, by the final third, there's no room left for subtlety.  What should play out as mind games end up being something fairly close to torture porn   a plot device used way too frequently in horror films these days.To further beat the dead horse, the dodge they use makes little sense to the chronology of the film: the final moments are a book ended revisitation of the picture's opening segment, forcing you   the viewer   to suddenly realize what you may have just seen may, in fact, NOT be what you just saw.  While others might find this `genius' or `groundbreaking,' I found it more than a bit fraudulent.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED.  It's probably a one off picture for most people (meaning it's worth a single viewing).  The ultimate problem with ASYLUM BLACKOUT isn't in its performances or execution; rather, it's in its conception.  Given the nature of the story   think of a really good episode of `The Twilight Zone' that went too far   is that once you know the ending, you have to re evaluate everything you've seen heading up to it.  When you look too closely at the seams, then suddenly you realize you're W A T C H I N G a movie instead of being immersed in one   the way you are a really good book.  Instead of enjoying it, you realize that you've been duped   and not in a good way   only now you've wasted the last 90 minutes and can't get `em back ... which is kinda sorta like what happens to George.",2 and  Stars: ASYLUM BLACKOUT Could've Used A Bit More Bright Light,1356998400,"01 1, 2013"

"As my title says, ""Brake"" is a mixed bag in that it generates definite interest based on the atmosphere while adding some very implausible dialogue. A young cool professional dude is trapped in a clear rectangular box while we deduce terrorists want info on the US  president.I believe a greater fear would be upon most in this situation, and although there are people who are committed to their core ethics, they would be much less defiant not knowing what kind of further evil treatment would be forced upon them. A little too movie esque  for my taste. The film reaches into past ideas as it unravels it's true meaning which would be a spoiler here (as if some haven't done that already). The ""ending ending"" was actually satisfying and broke free of the predictable endings we have seen time and again. The last 15 minutes of the film were the best and held to realism that left an impression on me. It is unfortunate that the prior one hour and fifty minutes didn't equal it.Not a bad time pjazzer if your trapped in your own box (a motel room).",Mixed bag -- solid ending,1351814400,"11 2, 2012"

"Not unlike its predecessor, Pan's Labyrinth, this film is beautifully photographed on a dramatic shore with a lighthouse and an old orphanage that has now become home to a couple with an adopted son.  That the parents have kept the adoption and the boy's HIV status a secret from him, and that his mother had grown up in the orphanage, set in motion a chain of sad and frightening events when the ghosts of dead orphans tell the boy the truth.  There's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy; unfortunately, she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura, the mother, what she needs to know.The boy, Simon, disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.All of this ends with life after death; Laura, Simon and the others die, but they seem to be very much alive, with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older, and Simon is reunited with her as well.There is even a hint at the end that Laura's husband is greeted by her and the boy, though we will never know for sure.It seems to be a common thread in this director's work that the living and the dead, the reality and the fantasy, are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other.  I will be very curious to see what he does with The Hobbit.","Lovely, scary, and heartbreaking",1211846400,"05 27, 2008"
"Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before, the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind. The plots are awfully dull, even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times.

"I looked forward to this show as Las Vegas had been one of my favorite destinations especially the Fremont street area in the decades from the 1960's through the 1990's. I went to gamble and the Strip was not the place to do that sort of fun activity, poor odds and game rules.  So as I look at this show as regards the entertainment factor I can say it's OK.  Scripts were predictable, characters were cardboard standups, and overall typical bland TV pap.  Now I didn't expect this show to be historically accurate to the last detail but too many things were wrong.  This show was supposed to be taking place about 1961, but cars used ranged from Fords and Chevys from the mid 50's (OK) to the mid 1960's (not OK). Also some of the casino signs for casinos supposedly along the downtown area were from the Strip, i.e. the Stardust. It appears the producers raided the sign graveyard and used the signs in the best condition.  What broke my heart, because I once was an avid car collector, was the senseless destruction of limited collector quality cars. I'm sure that if CGI  was used it would have been less expensive and just as realistic as the destruction of the actual cars. Those scenes were on the screen a few seconds only.

"Controversial as this film already is (the critics hate it, those who have watched it either hate or love it), it is a solid stretch of cinematic art by writer director Nicolas Winding Refn. He is an artist who challenges audiences and takes enormous risks: his 1996 film, the extremely violent and uncompromising PUSHER became a cult phenomenon and won Refn instant international critical acclaim. That was followed by BLEEDER and the now cult cljazzic DRIVE. Each of these films is highly stylized and focuses on introverted reactions to outward situations. ONLY GOD FORGIVES pushes those traits even further: completely set in Thailand it weighs in on Asian symbolism, spiritualism and response to revenge or own hand rights. It is very dark, both in the cinematography of Larry Smith and in the ever present veneer of killing and death and mutilation. The entire film is a study in color manipulation, slow movement (as in Noh theater), minimal dialog, and even more minimal character development. And yet somehow Refn makes all of this work to his advantage to hold the audience, as though imprisoned, to examine the extents of evil.The setting is Bangkok. Ten years ago Julian (Ryan Gosling) killed a man and went on the run. Now he manages a Thai boxing club as a front for a drugs operation. Respected in the criminal underworld, deep inside, he feels empty. When Julian's brother Billy (Tom Burke) murders an underage prostitute, the police call on retired cop Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm)   the Angel of Vengeance whose other obsession is Karaoke singing. Chang allows the father to kill his daughter's murderer, then 'restores order' by chopping off the man's right hand. Julian's mother Crystal (Kristin Scott Thomas)   the foul mouthed nasty head of a powerful criminal organization   arrives in Bangkok to collect her favorite first son's body. She charges Julian to find his killers and 'raise hell'. Despite being beaten severely in a fight with Chang, Julian's inability to react to anything   even to the physical relationship with a strange girl Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam)   leads to mayhem that in many ways does not even seem to affect him.The casting is strange: obviously Ryan Gosling was hired for the role of Julian because of his works with Reyn in DRIVE. He is called upon to do very little and as a result we are not able to appreciate his motivation or his presence in the story.  Kristin Scott Thomas is a brilliant actress but here she is merely a source of filthy accusations and Kabuki like poses. The star of the film is Vithaya Pansringarm, and even though we loathe him and his malicious manner he alone gives us an idea of why he is doing what he is doing, framing it all with obnoxious Karaoke singing in a garish nightclub.  Everything about the film is slow and dark and yet for some obscure reason it works.  Grady Harp, July 13",`Time to meet the devil.',1374278400,"07 20, 2013"

"Today marks the first day I've ever seen this show.  This is just an off the top of my head review.The first scenario involved a husband who said his wife accidentally shot herself.  However, the forensics prove that she could not have done so.  The husband was a lawyer and he was having an affair with a judge.  That reminded me of the female astronaut who drove for eight hours wearing adult diapers.  The point is: people in prestigious professions sometimes do stupid things for love lust just like the way a Jerry Springer guest would.I watch ""Forensic Files"" religiously.  I immediately began comparing contrasting the two shows.  This show is twice as long, so I figured they must go into depth more.  However, they have two scenarios in many episodes.  So it's just like watching two consecutive episodes of ""Forensic Files"" which is ofte how it's aired on TruTV anyway.  In fact, the second scenario here was reported on ""Forensic Files.""  I could tell because they showed the white murder victim wearing traditional Japanese garb.  This makes me wonder if there aren't that many forensics saved the case fact patterns in the world.  However, that may be a good thing if that means the murder rate is getting lower in this country.  This scenario showed a theme often relayed on ""Forencic Files"": single women who leave their doors open or are just moving in and violating men take advantage of them.  Single women: please lock your doors and windows as much as possible!  I think Polynesian guys are hot and they had a Polynesian interviewee here.

"Aftershock (Nicol&aacute;s L&oacute;pez, 2012)Man, Aftershock got excoriated by both the media (as of this writing it has a 35% critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes) and the public (26%), hasn't it? Now, I will be the first to admit that I can be easy to please (though my movie reviews are pretty close to a bell curve, so make of that what you will), but, well, I kinda liked it. It wasn't Hostel, but then, the same week I watched Aftershock, I also watched Daydreamer, Order of Chaos, The Oxford Murders, Apollo 18, Five Dolls for an August Moon, and Appetite, and all got lower ratings than Aftershock. So it's not like I'm watching these things in a vaccum... it seemed to me that L&oacute;pez and Guillermo Amoedo (Retorno) took the seventies disaster flick and the naughties survival horror flick and combined them with pretty darn good results&#8212;nothing spectacular, but certainly not bad.Pollo (Que Pena tu Vida's Nicol&aacute;s Martinez, doing his best Zach Galifinakis impersonation) and Ariel (Promedio Rojo's Ariel Levy) are a couple of Chileans hanging out with a friend they affectionately call Gringo (Inglourious Basterds' Eli Roth). After some setup that really is one of the movie's weak parts, the three of them find themselves in one of Chile's sleekest nightclubs, a marvel of underground engineering...that is the worst place in the country to be when a mjazzive earthquake hits. (There have been tremors in the film previously, dismissed by Pollo as nothing out of the ordinary. Oops.) Also trapped with them are some lovely ljazzes the predictably socially awkward guys have been hitting on (there's an interesting romance subplot that begins to develop between Ariel, the non party guy of the trio, and the straitlaced older sister, but that takes a backseat to survival, unfortunately). However, once they get out of the collapsing nightclub, they discover that they might have been better off staying underground.No, there's nothing new here. But the combination of old is interesting, the characters are stock without being stereotypes, and there is real tension to be had in some places where it is unexpected. It may seem as if I am praising with faint darn, and that is accurate; I enjoyed the movie without being wild about it, so I'm trying to be restrained as much as I can while still saying &#8220;yeah, you should watch this and ignore what you're hearing from everyone else&#8221;. It's not breaking any new ground, hardy har har, but as far as being a mildly interesting disaster flick with survival horror elements, it fills the bill. ** ",Don't wait for your neighbor.,1396742400,"04 6, 2014"

The jokes are way too forced, 3 4 of the acting is bad, and I just don't see how they will pull off this premise for an entire season, let alone multiple seasons.  Let me guess; they'll have a difficult start to the season, lots of interpersonal relationship issues between the teammates and administrative staff as they struggle to find common ground with a female owner and a soft spoken boy next door GM who eventually win them over, so eventually they'll bond and somehow fight their way to the top.  And then what?  I could see it as a cheesy sports movie, but not a television show.  They're just trying too hard.

"This movie requires patience, but if you don't have it just fast forward till it looks interesting.  This is a decent thriller, but not overly thrilling.  I just couldn't get into the characters.  I watched it but I found myself fast forwarding which I don't do very often.  I think perhaps this movie needed better editing, there was to much footage of mountain scenery, parade, et cetera.  Had they trimmed there and developed the characters more it would have been better.  It doesn't take all that much to figure out what is going on, and they dragged us with all the extra footage.  There are some great scenes of them escaping the bad guys, but they needed a bad guy boss on the scene with some character.  The bad guys are okay but nothing made me think, oh those guys really scare me (see John Lithgow's great performance in Cliffhanger).  In fact I think they were made to look so cold blooded I just didn't care about them at all.  The five people on the mountain are decent, but only a couple I halfway felt I knew a little by the end.  The police that try to help are barely developed so once again they are okay.  They needed more screen time because I started to like the black cop, but didn't get time to really know him.  The girls father at the end was more interesting because you could feel his intensity.  All in all a pretty decent movie but it had a lot more potential had they developed more of the characters and spent less time on the surroundings. I love scenery and sets, but they don't make the movie, the actors and story do.  At this less than seven dollar price it is worth buying.Recommendations:Shoot to Kill,Cliffhanger, andThe Eiger SanctionCA Luster",A Lonely Place to Die [Blu-ray],1374192000,"07 19, 2013"
"We see it over and over again with Horror, a film with a decent storyline, starts out great, and quickly descends into a pointless mess of blood and guts. The Shrine was a film I really wanted to like. I was intrigued by the Netflix description, and had they stuck with that story, maybe this one would have been a winner, unfortunately they didn't. The Shrine starts out by telling us of a student backpacking through Europe, who goes missing in the small town of Alvania, Poland. Some reporters from his hometown get a whiff of the story and start poking around, only to find out that no one in the town is particularly interested in trying to find this kid, that's when the reports decide the only thing they can do is go there and look for him themselves. With films like Saw and The Offspring, the gore was absolutely necessary and added to the story, in The Shrine, it takes away from what was already a pretty good story. The small town was creepy and the story really played to peoples fear of disappearing without a trace, while on vacation. The film may have been a little bit slow moving, but it was very intense and interesting until the last forty five minutes. That's when it goes demonic and becomes nothing but one bloody body after another. For me, films like the Shrine are the most disappointing of all, because the writers didn't believe in their story and ultimately destroy it in order to get more viewers. The demonic slaughterhouse may have appealed to a larger audience, but it certainly didn't make this a better film.",The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]  - @tss5078,1371168000,"06 14, 2013"

"I loved it! At first I thought that the premise was a little unrealistic. I mean, really, four senators sharing a house? How probable is that. I thought that it would be much more realistic if they had used Representatives. That I could see.Turns out that the show actually has some strong basis in reality. If you Google search for ""senators roommates"", then the first result is a New York Times article ( [...] ) about two high ranking senators and two representatives sharing a house together: Senators Charles E. Schumer and Richard J. Durbin, and Representatives George Miller (the house owner) and Bill Delahunt (who must have left since then as he did not seek re election). The four are Democrats, but I'm guessing that the show writers and producers chose to use Republicans to avoid any appearance of using their stories, which could have caused legal problems. Well, that, and Republicans are so much easier to mock, since it's in vogue, and Republican politicians have to present themselves as extremists in order to stay in office. (BTW, I'm a Libertarian, so I can claim to be less biased then the vast majority of reviewers. This totally mocks Republicans, but the jokes are well deserved; I would say the same thing about well deserved jokes directed at Democrats; and even about Libertarians, if well deserved, since I'm really moderate for the party.) Another similarity is that the Miller house has two single rooms and a shared room, just like the Alpha House. I'm actually surprised that the show didn't have the usual B.S. disclaimer about any similarities to actual people is just a coincidence. Maybe the producers have admitted that they were inspired by the Miller house.I'm a little bummed that Bill Murray may have only been making a cameo, but I'm guessing that if his legal troubles entangle a roommate or two that we could keep seeing him pop up, which would be awesome. Although, I wouldn't be sad if they didn't bring him back because he was over acting quite a bit, but that's why we love him, right?Based on the cast and how professionally this was filmed I'm guessing that the show is already slated for a full season (maybe even already in production?), but that Amazon is just casting it as a ""test"" pilot in order to direct attention to their other actual test pilots.

"Everyone knew ""Liz and Dick"" was going to be a disaster as soon as it was announced. Two reasons why:1. It was being made by the Lifetime Network, with a TV movie budget.2. It starred Lindsay Lohan.The pessimism was not unwarranted    this movie is so bad that I'm surprised Richard Burton hasn't risen from the dead just to throw liquor bottles at the people responsible. I actually hoped that it would be bad in a hilarious, campy way, but instead it's just hideously awkward, cheesy and cheap. As Lohan croaks at one point, ""I'M SO BORED!""The story is narrated by Elizabeth Taylor (Lohan) and Richard Burton (Grant Bowler) from the afterlife. Apparently the heavenly host really want to hear the inside scoop on their relationship. It started during the shooting of ""Cleopatra,"" when Shakespearean actor Burton was unexpectedly cast opposite the scandal generating superstar Elizabeth Taylor.Well, despite a rocky start, they began a torrid affair. Their romance destroyed both their marriages (her fourth, his first) and caused an even bigger scandal than her previous homewrecking affair. Over the next twelve years, they lived in a whirl of fights, lovemaking, tragedy, alcoholism and gems    only to divorce, marry and divorce all over again.The story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton really needs a HBO miniseries, because it's impossible to cram twenty plus years of high drama into a 90 minute Lifetime movie. And the rushed pace is only one of the movie's problems    cheap looking costumes, awful greenscreen, and a choppy disjointed narrative.And yes, the writing is eye rollingly bad (""You do know I'm shagging him senseless, don't you?""), but not in a funny way. I hoped this would be an over the top, campy funny mess, but it was simply dull and fragmented.But the death knell for this movie is Lohan. I have literally seen cats who give better performances than her. Her performance in this movie is more Tommy Wiseau than Elizabeth Taylor    a doughy, puffy faced, larygngitic mess that croaks her way through unconvincing fights and crying jags, unable to even convey BOREDOM.And yes, she is even WORSE when she tries to convey some emotional depth (""I am your ocean, but he was your anchor""). For example, Taylor's ""suicide""    complete with prancing, posing and Bella Swan style ""despairisms""    is one of the worst scenes I have seen on television. EVER.It makes me feel sorry for Grant Bowler, who actually seems to be trying REALLY REALLY HARD despite Lohan and a dreadful script dragging him down. Despite the movie's awfulness, he does convey some of the tormented, hard drinking poet, when he isn't being saddled with dreadful dialogue. And David Hunt gives one of the few good performances as Burton's tragic brother Ifor.I hoped that ""Liz and Dick"" would be a movie that was hilariously, mockably bad... but no, it's just tedious and horribly written, with the worst cast Elizabeth Taylor EVER.",I (don't) want more,1353888000,"11 26, 2012"

"Redemption is a movie about a homeless and on the run from a military court martial,damaged ex special forces soldier (Statham) who is navigating London's criminal underworld and finds a way to seize an opportunity to jazzume another man's identity    transforming into an avenging angel in the process.I was surprised a bit at this movie as I have been looking for a good Statham movie since the original Transporter...a lot of his roles since then have been the same old..same old and frankly several have been disappointing at bringing nothing new but this was different than the standard Statham action movie playing the same character.  Some people might be disappointed as this is less action than the usual Statham action fare and actually brings a story with some heart and conflict at the same time.Whereas Statham plays the role of the mob thug in the movie trying to find a way back from the demons, this movie concentrates less on the action part and more on the conflict between the main character's demons and his conscious, provided in the nun who isn't sure what her own path is.Statham does a good job at playing the role and Agata Buzek excels as the nun who struggles with her own path in life.The movie starts a little slowly but does have action in the right places without muddling the story unnecessarily.One thing that made me like the movie as it didn't have your typical happy ending and did a good job at depicting the no easy answers to life and your demons message.Definitely one of the better Statham movies I have seen in a while and a worthwhile watch. 3 and half stars.",A different role for Statham 3.5 stars,1380585600,"10 1, 2013"

"Character development at its best. At first  I was reluctant, not wanting even to watch episode one, season one, of this series. In spite of my reluctance, the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends, and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests. I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting, of the film (filmed in 35 mm film), but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White, the protagonist of the series, is a high school, genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer. After being told that the cancer was inoperable, and sneaking a peek into his bank account, he realizes his financial situation isn't healthy at all, worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White. With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment, Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed. His brother in law, a DEA agent, spoils hims by saying a meth cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine. Being a chemistry genius, he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect, purest recipe for cooking meth. He wouldn't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business. He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the ""righteous"" act of providing for his family's future when it meant going to the dark side of money making by not selling, but actually making the drugs: cooking meth (a.k.a crystal meth, ice, clouds, crystal, gljazz, tik, catch my drift?). It felt wrong but somehow, the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use? It's used for ADHD, narcolepsy, and treatment resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there, ""the blue stuff"", Walter and Jesse (his partner, a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth cook) found trench after trench, failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product, which albeit highly addictive, always seemed to fall into the wrong hands. Fail after epic fail, they found themselves delving into the dark world of selling drugs, not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path. They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord, a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable, with more than just a great story line and more than just action and adventure psychological excitement. Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series: How a man in search of a path, once thought righteous and bittersweet, found that he, in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark side, embraced them  the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth. How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor, Brian Cranston, winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008, 2009, and 2010.In parallel with Walter's charter development, I also admire Jesse Pinkman's (Aaron Paul) devolution into a darker creature, more menacing, less tolerant and much less merciful. If he started out as a meth head, he slowly turned into an character of many layers, of half patched hidden depths. After having suffered beatings, the death of his true love, and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face, Pinkman becomes a man to fear, a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode, I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each, but hell, the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it, you're lured into its mind gripping world; you can't just shake it off. You'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes, divided in two parts. The first part was debuted last year, and the second part will be premiered in August 2013. It will surely be a blast as Mr. White's, Jesse's, Skyler's and Hank's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION:I've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode:Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug ""meth"" by amateurs in their own ""RV super lab""? Or could it, in the contrary, decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families?",Breaking Bad *spoiler alert*,1373846400,"07 15, 2013"
"Mediocre at best. The shoddy acting is really what holds this show down, but if you can look past that then there are a few good points in it's favor. It's really hard to overlook the fact that it's so obvious that the Hood is Oliver, until this episode he didn't even bother wearing a mask. I know, I know, he had some kind of greasy face paint that did NOT fool anyone.  Oh wait, it fooled everyone. While I am facepalming thinking to myself &#34;Is everyone in this show really that stupid?? Yes, apparently they are.The action sequences are very well done, the costume and the hardware realistic.  The plot (in my opinion) is fairly cheesy and cliche. Every new character introduction is a new love interest and will, unwaveringly, develop some kind of superpower. A superpower that will, by inevitable misunderstanding, turn them against the protagonist and an entire season will be filled with correcting said misunderstanding by fist or by politics.  blah blah blah  but watchable. If I was to write a detailed review it would be summed up as &#34;fun, but predictable and overly cliche&#34;.So in summary:  If you like a show you can fast forward to the fight scenes and still know what's happening, and what's going to happen next, then this show is for you.","Best series ever!

The adult son, controlling mother, cranky father was done before, and infinitely better on Everybody Loves Raymond.  The other thing that really hurts this show is the 1980's era laugh track.

"(Spoiler alert)When Rick and the Governor were locked in a final tussle, they were (unknown to the characters) battling for the entertainment value of the series. If one lives, the series stays awake, as it had been for two great episodes. If the other lives, it goes back to sleep. The trusty Gov' had already beheaded the second most annoying character in our cast; now he was on the verge of truly freeing us from earnest tragic overload...But they KILLED him off. When it began, ""Walking Dead"" was great fun, because it reveled in the things that a good horror story can do. The guy trapped under the tank surrounded by zombies was just what we want with our popcorn. But it slowly morphed into this preachy tale of whining, goody goody characters who are always worried about morality. These solemn, sermonizing bores. Horror is supposed to set us free, by loosing our demons. We want mayhem. We want people to do the wrong things for the wrong reasons. We want the savage battle of the instinctual. Let's face it, normal life is so stifling; we civilized folks have to hide our inner thoughts and desires, but in good horror stories they are given free rein and we can relax and laugh at how awful we just might be. The Governor was the only character who made this series feel alive. When he came back on the scene, we were enthralled, because we never know what he will do next   but we know it will be ruthless, amoral, and will serve his compulsion to defend HIS people against anyone else's people.So they kill him off, apparently because ""right"" must win. He should have mowed down the whole tiresome Rick community, taken over the prison, and then eventually been annihilated by some bigger force    either a more powerful ""Governor"" type or a plague of zombies. He can die in the end (like Mr. Hyde, like the werewolf in so many movies, like Dracula) but WHEN he dies, that has to be it. That's a wrap. Curtains. Instead we have the always sad, solemn, struggling, pathetic, moral, but above all boring Rick leading us into ever more maudlin pathways.The premise of the walking dead, after all, is preposterous. That brain tissue in this kind of dilapidated state, let alone starved for any nourishment, could animate a human body is beyond silly. And that's fine, that's what makes it okay to let our demons romp. But to try to stitch a serious story to such a premise is really inept. You can't have people agonizing over fine moral dilemmas and then going down to the fence to stab rotting heads with sticks. Please, writers, get it together. The premise just won't bear this pretentious level of drama. You have to keep a certain tongue in cheek.If I want Kumbaya, agonized soul searching, or a pep talk for the United nations, I'll watch a documentary or a drama. But this is horror.

CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER, although it falls short in either department. Writer Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on. This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all too familiar plot and predictable characters. CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels, but these are short lived. The added gore, claustrophobic sets, and winning make up designs do work to the film's advantage as well, however. With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain's near limitless powers, CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed, but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.

The visual effects and scenery are well done and the city detail was done very well but  the plot of the movie seems to be a combo remake of Gladiator and Titanic which seems to muddle both stories especially considering we all know the volcano blows up and destroys the whole city and everyone in it.The special effects are done well though especially when it comes to the volcano and the destruction of the city at the end of the movie.The movie is ok to watch with its disaster type situation that makes it interesting enough to entertain you but the generic love story and Roman versus Horseman subplot make this movie lesser than the sum of its parts.",Ok to watch,1400544000,"05 20, 2014"
"I love hate this show.  It's one of the best of the ID detective shows in that they don't use actors or recreations, the cameras are there following all the action.  That's very cool.  But it seems like half or more of the episodes are based on stories that weren't ready for prime time.  Like they didn't wait long enough for things to be resolved and just built up a big drama only to leave the viewer hanging in the middle with maddeningly little follow up, if any.  The episode ""Cast of Thousands"" is a prime example.  It's all builds up to ... nothing, and then ends abruptly.  They might say that's how things are in the real world and they're just reflecting the hard reality of it.  I think that's a lame excuse for not being more selective about what they air.  I don't think many people want to just be left hanging over and over again like this.  This was made in 2009, now it's 2013, can't there be better follow ups at the end of the shows at this point?  In one episode they actually built up a strong seeming case against somebody, and then the show ended with the statement that the case was dismissed.

"Disappointing English language remake of the cljazzic 1976 Spanish horror flick Who Can Kill A Child? about a young couple on vacation who land on an island that seems to be completely deserted except for some children.  Stephen King co opted the basic premise for his famous 1977 short story Children of the Corn so what seemed pretty novel and shocking in 1976 is much less so now.  This version follows the old Spanish flick very, very closely but where the original was extremely creepy this version is hamstrung by lousy acting (from the adult leads and the children alike) and never manages to generate any suspense whatsoever.  In this film the first victim the protagonist sees killed by the children is stabbed and bludgeoned with rocks.  In the original film the first victim was hung up like a human pinata while a smiling little girl slashes at him with a scythe.  Which sounds creepier to you?

"Even though I loved the show, there were great seasons and bad seasons. In ranking the seasons, there are several contenders for worst including season 4 when the show had gotten through its initial 3 season arc and was flailing around for stories when it seemed like it was on the verge of becoming stuck in &#34;whacky characters doing stuff&#34; tedium (with Sarah Chalke hanging out to remind us of Scrubs and what happens when that's the show) and barely moved to growth and development. There was season 6 with Zoey sucking the life out of everything.Still, this one is the worst for several reasons. The growth that the characters have gone through seem to be temporary at best. Even after Barney and Robin get engaged, there are episodes with Barney going back to the Playbook which had stopped being funny years ago. Abby Eliot plays a cartoonish shrew as Ted's last crazy girlfriend. This season also has the groan inducing episode where Marshall is arguing a case in a courtroom and everyone pretends to be tough in high school. The new joke about Robin always yelling at Patrice is only serving to make Robin unlikeable.There are some ok episodes, mostly when the show is pushing forth the Robin Barney coupling and when the show mentions the overall mythology.

"I really liked the basic concept    a brilliant but deranged serial killer has developed an army of sleepers who continue to execute his plan despite being caught. When you think about the potential of how warped it can get, it's a clever formula that pushes the boundaries of procedural cop TV drama.Unfortunately, rather than the main bad guy building a cult through religion or some political point of view, it centers around the writings of Edgar Allen Poe. Actually, it really centers around The Raven since the writers were too lazy to read anything else he wrote and have kept the references to what the average Fox viewer might have seen from a Simpsons Halloween special. And we're really suspending our disbelief here since our English teacher slash killer has brainwashed his followers into very complicated crimes based upon some lectures on some arcane analysis of Poe's literature. Seriously? I'll buy into Homeland's brainwashed military hero turning to terrorism just because it's great television but this is like suggesting that readers of The Oatmeal are going to start murdering badgers.That aside, the show has quickly descended into ""nutjob of the week"" territory and the overarching story line of the season isn't going anywhere fast. Bacon's tormented brilliant but alcoholic investigator character gets less interesting with every episode. The writers seem to have forgotten the alcoholism problem completely and now it's simply a cat and mouse game between the hero and villain who are essentially opposite parts of the same person. If Homeland became ridiculous when Carrie discovered she was crazy, The Following jumps straight into absurdity with the main character's supposed weakness.The crimes each week are really, really unbelievable. The followers show a near telepathic level of prediction when it comes to breaking into people's houses and being able to act on highly detailed maniacal plans despite the main architect operating from a prison cell. It also reruns every horror movie cliche to the point where you know there's going to be a killer behind someone when they close the bathroom mirror. Although the extreme gore is there to make all this look very serious, I find myself laughing at each plot twist since I have as much luck convincing you to steal a pack of gum with this review as the killer has of making any of this happen through his Poe obsession.Basically, The Following just reminds me how mediocre network programming is compared with cable shows like Dexter and Homeland.

"Vanishing on 7th Street's trailer looked decent enough.  Unfortunately, that's ALL it had going for it.  I have stated many times before that the audience in ANY horror thriller movie sometimes is asked to suspend logic, but I think ANY audience deserves a few answers  even fleeting ones.  None exist in this movie.It begins with four different main characters coming to the realization that they may be the only people left in this City because everyone else has vanished.  All that is left behind are piles of clothing.  That brought me to question one:  why did they survive?  They then spend a good amount of time stumbling and mumbling through various and sundry situations, which brings me to question 2:  was this the ONLY city that had experienced a ""vanishing""?  You are then treated to more and more scenes of utter stupidity and the constant chanting of ""I exist; I exist"" until they all start to be picked off by the ""shadow people.""  This led me to my next set of questions:  why couldn't they find some generators at a local store and have all the lights they wanted?  Why couldn't they light (and keep lit) a fire?  Why did they STAY in that City?  And last (but certainly not least) WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME?Other reviewers have hinted at this movie's potential.  I'm just not sure that it ever HAD any potential.  I didn't really care for the majority of the survivors and they all continued to make such stupid, moronic choices I was actually rooting for the shadows!Rated R for, hmmmmm, I don't know what for.",Go Away,1310428800,"07 12, 2011"
The Legend of Korra is an okay sequel to the Avatar.  It starts out a little slow but later episodes start to get better.  The animation is great and like the original Avatar the characters are written with depth if not sometimes a little too silly.

"Nine Things about The Canyons1. This movie was written by Bret Easton Ellis and directed by Paul Schrader. If you know those names, you will have a pretty good idea what this movie is about. If you don&#8217;t know those names, how about this: It stars Lindsay Lohan and porn star James Deen.2. Paul Schrader summarized the movie the best &#8211; it&#8217;s about beautiful people doing bad things in nice rooms.3. More specifically, it&#8217;s about a girl that wants to make a movie, and she gets her boyfriend cast in it by convincing the producer&#8217;s jazzistant that he would be a great choice. And they are all secretly cheating on each other. With each other.4. A lot of people, including myself, were looking forward to this movie. It could have been edgy, dark, and hip. The key term here is &#8220;could have been&#8221;.5. This movie is a mess. It turned itself into a parody of what it was trying to do. The acting is terrible. The story is ludicrous, which is especially frustrating to me because Ellis is one of my all time favorite authors.6. When I say the acting is terrible, there is one exception. Believe it or not, Lindsay Lohan did pretty well. She was the best part of the film. Porn star James Deen has the acting ability of, well, a porn star. Let&#8217;s just leave it at that.7. I do have to give the movie points for having the guts to show male full frontal nudity, instead of just female nudity.8. The movie is interesting on a meta level in that you can see how the movie was made. It was funded on Kickstarter and cast through a website. This is obvious. The budget is so low (reportedly, the actors were paid $100 a day) that you can actually see how the thing was put together.9. Fans of bad movies may find this entertaining. It tries so hard to be serious that it turns into a comedy. But as an actual movie, this was one of the biggest disappointments of the year for me.",one of the biggest disappointments of the year,1387756800,"12 23, 2013"

"I've said it before, and, if RITES OF SPRINGS teaches me anything, it's that it often bears repeating: almost anyone with an idea can write and shoot a slasher horror picture these days, AND almost any studio will distribute it.  The upside?  The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let's say ""less than good"" product, and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare.  The downside?  Well, because the dynamics of producing even a modestly thought out idea, video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Don't say I didn't warn you.After killing a local businessman's wife, a group of entry level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $1 million ransom.  Hiding out in an abandoned school, the team of criminals is surprised when a blood stained young woman stumbles into their hidey hole ... with a maniacal axe wielding killer in pursuit!  Forced to team up for safety, the criminals and the young woman realize they're in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unless they can cooperate, they're bound to become the lunatic's dinner ... or something.This is Dumb.  Yes, dumb.  With a capital `D.'(NOTE: unfortunately, there's no way to review RITES without some spoilers, folks.  So if you want to know my final rating, then jump down to the last two paragraphs.  However, if you're up for some laughs, then read on!)Writer director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill prepared slasher script I've watched in decades.  To his credit, there's some mythology here   apparently, the `barn creature' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring, hence the title   though it makes absolutely no sense.  See, he has a keeper who   for reasons never made clear   catches the women for him.  The `barn creature' can't do it himself (or herself?) because he's kept locked in the cellar of a barn (?!?!) for the rest of the year.Not only that, but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot looking women, though (again) we're given no logical explanation for that, either.  Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers' fates once we've seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual   Reynolds calls them ""rites"" for a reason, kiddies   has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.  Instead, the townies go about their business like nothing's ever happened, and you can what happens from there.Not only that, but these characters aren't fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac's blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife.  There's the bad criminal.  Then, there's the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he's $300,000 in debt.  There's that guy's good looking girlfriend (can you guess her fate?).  Then there that guy's mistake prone brother (can you guess his fate?).Not only that, but, technically, the film stinks of amateurism.  Here's a tip: when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand held camera of any sort, it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then.  I have nothing against the herky jerky documentary look of filmmaking, but, when you do it in a slasher film, you're constantly giving the audience the impression that you're seeing things from the perspective of the killer.  When that ain't the case, you're confusing the story!  And to complicate matters further, the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch.  Literally!  Guy goes into the abandoned school, and it's bright daylight; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later, and it's the dark of night.  Really?  Plus, as long as I'm piling it on, do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only?  I mean, maybe that's the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned, after all.  The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film's credit, it ends.  However, the way it ends, makes absolutely no sense, and I (seriously) laughed for about five minutes.  I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut, his crew took him seriously.  Stay tuned after the credits, though, because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs?RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight, Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in jazzociation with Vigilante Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should   not a bad thing, just nothing all that special.  A few sequences were poorly miked, but, when you're making schlock horror on a budget, you take what you get.  The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind the scenes materials, if you're inclined to check `em out.  Again, nothing special, but it's nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale; it's just too bad it wasn't in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you're a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh.  It isn't that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made.  To the contrary, the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way.  It's just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense.  It's as if writer director Reynolds had an idea   one based on a regular diet of slash and gore   and then he ran with it.  And why not?  Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit, if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review.","RITES OF SPRING Really Should've Been Called ""The Barn Monster of Rural Mississippi""",1353024000,"11 16, 2012"

"Like HBO's ""Deadwood"" series, ""Californication"" defies viewers to look beyond the obvious, coarse provocations that frame the show and look into the souls of its characters. In this case, it's egregious swearing, brazen sexuality and occasional drug use that are thrown at the audience, in this rough and tumble portrait of Hank Moody, a bad boy boho novelist who's made it to Hollywood only to lose his moral compjazz, and his marriage as well.Although the Moody character seems a little forced    he's a two fisted, heavy drinking thinking man's roughneck who sleeps with any gal that pauses long enough to make eye contact    actor David Duchovny invests the character with unexpected nuances and depth, and turns in a fine performance all around. Indeed, viewers like myself, who thought he was kind of a dud as Agent Mulder (in ""The X Files"") will be pleasantly surprised to find what a clever, funny performer he actually can be. Likewise, this show will sweep you up and ensnare you in its ribald humor, jaw dropping outrageousness and intelligent writing. There's great dialog, plenty of hot monkey love, a de rigeur skewering of vapid LA culture, and a delicious, fast paced soap opera scandal that will get you squirming in your seat. Yummy fun!

"This is a zomedy movie.  Not a zombie movie. Although it does of course feature zombies. In this case green moss takes people over and they become zombies.This is a campy movie and has scenes  which are pure camp with over the top things like ' banners that appear and say 'barachi brothers attack"".  etc. And of course our heroes , two arab dutch guys , and two black dutch guys and  blonde hot dutch woman battle the zombies and get lots of green slime on them and don't change into zombies. Unless they are bitten. So on that level , logic is thrown out the window. But this is not a serious movie. It's got lots of zombies that get blown away though and decent special effects , especially the cgi space station that crashes into Holland.  But serious zombie fans are going to be not too happy with this is they want a non comedy zombie flick. It's in dutch with English subtitles and if you can't enjoy a movie that's not in English , well that's sorta sad , just because you have to read subs?.  This film is often silly and meant to be. The gore and such are just part of the whole backdrop. ANd the ending is well really dumb. But it's a comedy so they just threw that in.

"In ""Maniac,"" Elijah Wood plays the (perhaps Ed Gein inspired) scalping serial killer, but you don't see much of him in this remake of a 1980 American cult horror film. The new film is shot in a first person POV style for the most part of it, and the face of Elijah Wood's character Frank Zito can be seen only in reflections.Directed by Franck Khalfoun (""P2"" ""Wrong Turn at Tahoe"") and co written by Alexandre ""High Tension"" Aja (with Gr&eacute;gory Levjazzeur), ""Maniac"" manages to create some stomach churning moments, thanks to the blood and gore special effects, but not much suspense because of the uninspired direction heavily reliant on the gimmicky narrative.What is really impressive about the remake is the nice, Giorgio Moroder like soundtrack music that is worth listening to, even if you are not particularly interested in horror genre. As to the film itself, it is a typical case of style over substance.

"This movie was boring.  There are some movies that brilliantly let the viewer experience violence, without the violence actually being seen, leaving the viewer to reconstruct the scene in his her mind, and or consider ambiguous plot details (who is the actual killer?).  Pulp Fiction comes to mind, at least insofar as most violence was just barely removed from the actual screen.  This film tries to recreate that approach, but it falls flat.  There has to be a strong plot connection for the actual violence implied violence to have an impact, and that connection is lacking here.  In most scenes, we come to realize that someone has been killed, but rather than having a strong emotional impact, its a simply ""so what"" event.  The viewer is never brougth into the antagonist's or protagonist's emotional sphere, so you never really care. You never feel like the protagonist (Luke Wilson) is actually threatened, so everything else has no impact.  Further, Luke Wilson, while decent for low brow, college level humor, is way out of his league playing this kind of role.  The movie is just flat and dull, not recommended.",boring,1344816000,"08 13, 2012"

"John and Dave are sucked in to an interdimensional time warp after taking a mysterious new drug known only as ""Soy Sauce"" that opens their minds to an incredible array of new powers. Now, these two unjazzuming slackers have become humanity's only defense against the otherworldly beings that look to take over the world! When it comes to strange, twisted tales of supernatural horror, no one does it better than Don Coscarelli, leaving no better choice to direct the off the wall Sci Fi Comedy JOHN DIES AT THE END. With JOHN DIES AT THE END, Coscarelli is once again left unrestrained by rules or logic thanks to the wild imaginings of David Wong in his original novel. While on the drug, the characters can communicate through time (let alone bratwursts), travel between dimensions, and even transcend death, which opens up an unlimited range of possibilities in this untamed universe. The problem is, Coscarelli starts the characters off in too many directions at once, and quickly loses focus as his signature form of non sequitur storytelling takes control. As a result, the failed attempt to wrap things up in the end feels rushed and unsatisfying, but the road leading up to it is both entertaining and exciting. Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes capture the satiric tone and irreverent humor perfectly through the characters of Dave and John, allowing the audience to overlook many other faults through their enjoyable performances. The smaller budget is also refreshing, since it forces the filmmakers to become more creative with both the outline of events and the special effects. There are more than enough stories to tell in this untapped universe, so hopefully the success of the film in the home video market will see JOHN brought back to life in a sequel!

"Frankly, 3 stars was gracious this season, but I like The Unit, and have great memories from a simpler time back in S 1 and possibly S 2 where the writers weren't trying to make some kind of metaphysical commentary on life, not to mention not trying to lure the 18 45 year old female demographic to watch the show with their boyfriends husbands.  I've always felt that when The Unit stuck to what it was good at, that being action based drama following one or a series of missions pertaining to a seasonal arc, it was not only a great show, but one of the best at what it was doing.  Its ensemble cast has always been strong, from Pedro Ceranno Haysbert to Max Martini's icy badjazzness.But this season, they went off the rails.Focusing more on the homelife (and the crossover fallout of using their wives as undercover operatives, what?!?!?!) Shawn Ryan managed to make a smart, at times funny, and always action packed show....well, cheesy.  I've always felt The Unit was at its worst when it tried to shift back and forth from marital life to battlefield because it detracted from the believability of both.  The wives get annoying fast, the kids even more so, and the mundaneness of life on base really couldnt be highlighted much without turning into a soap opera.Then, there is the whole Mack vision quest episode which was the turning point...strap the saddle on that shark, Fonzi, its time to ride!  And Betty Blue's love life arc?  Come on.  The Unit was always relatively believable, but with this season, this faded quickly.  Its a shame, because I think I'll probably purchase Seasons 1 and 2 for nostalgias sake.And while I'm at it, the opening theme ""Walk the Fire"" is the worst intro song I've heard since the 80's.  Replacing ""Fired Up"" (frankly, show opening perfection) in Season 3 could have been the start of the decline, I'm not sure, but it didnt help.

"The set up of a horror or thriller, such as ATM, is probably one of the most important parts of the film. You can expect a chase, gore scenes, some monstrosity's, and if time permits, character development. So here we have two seemingly successful people working in finance who leave a party to bring home a good looking woman, who also works with them. One of the guys needs to stop at an ATM to get money for his late night munchies.The film seems to be set in the city. New York City (or at least something like to NYC). But apparently the only ATM is on this remote street with no one around. Pulling up to the ATM, he parks, what seems like a half a block away. Why not just pull right up to it?? I don't know anyone that does this, especially at 1 in the morning. And so, between the car and the ATM hut stands the killer. And yes, they all forgot their cell phones in the car.I just get infuriated how people find themselves in situations like this. It could be argued on the other side that what are the chances of some crazy guy looking to kill some people locked in an ATM hut. But err on the safe side when the chances are higher that strange people creep around at night in big cities. Ultimately, however, it just seems too convenient for the killer to get into place.The film does not offer much other than high tension. As the other reviewers mentioned, the question of ""why"" is never answered. Clearly it is not supposed to. I am not sure if thats the question the film is offering either. I think its more stating that ""it can be done"". If we recall the opening credit sequence, we see maps and diagrams and coordinates. All of this for the killer as a challenge for technology.I am probably being more poetic than the film deserves, but its a measure of avoidance as the film has little substance to work with. Anything revealed gives away almost too much. I can only jazzume that the film was green lit based on a pitch and wasn't developed further.Now that I have my gripes out of the way, I will say that the film is well done and the drama is exciting and intense. The acting is credible and well executed, so that's a bonus. It is worth a rental, but not at the current price. I would wait for the actual DVD release. It was exciting and entertaining, but the lack of the depth the film has, I cannot merit it more than 2 stars.","I just can't justify 3 stars, despite it being entertaining",1331337600,"03 10, 2012"

"This movie is clearly intended to be a commentary on American's fear of Mexicans, with a particular slant arguing for the irrationality of this position.  I'm tired of having movies and media tell me how I should feel about this issue.  I'm even more tired of the attempt to cloak social and political commentary within a movie that's seemingly about conventional aliens.  District 9 was at least a highly engaging film.  I know Americans as a lot tend to expect fast paced, action filled films, but we do and so what? Right wrong or indifferent, Americans' general preferences align to these core values, with some exceptions here and there.  This film, unfortunately, doesn't fulfill.  While I appreciate its attempt to allegorically demonstrate the irrationality of Americans' core xenophobia, I'm sick of the message. Further, good satire, ironic or otherwise, derives its value from being a compelling story on multiple levels, including the simplistic, face value story presented, through its underlying messages.  This movie is just not that interesting on its face value level. It does a good job of making the key actors interesting and relatable to the audience, but their journey is much more matter of fact and devoid of conflict, that is just drags on without eliciting the emotional response the film clearly thinks it should drag out.  This is my principal complaint   the actual on screen action is widely disconnected from the message the story seems to be trying to convey.  I must say, however, that if you're renting this film, you'll likely not regret your decision, but if you buy, this will either end up on your ebay to sell list, or collect dust.","Interesting, but too overtly allegorical of current xenophobia",1297468800,"02 12, 2011"

"The Following is a suspenseful and complex thriller. The television series, which airs on Fox, is about FBI agent Hardy (Kevin Bacon) and a cult born from a notorious serial killer.Joe Carroll was arrested, and convicted, of several murders.

After a smart prison break, he sets out to finish off his work and utilizes the help of his ever growing psycho fan base.

"Parody of romantic comedies is a huge disappointment given all of the talent involved.  The idea was to do a meta romantic comedy that comments on all of the clich&eacute;s of the genre while also indulging in them  it feels like two thirds of the movie features the actors talking in air quotes.  Unfortunately with his focus on being clever writer director David Wain forgot to bring any laughs.  Seriously, I've seen god awful straight to video horror movies by The Asylum that were much funnier than this.Not that it matters but if They Came Together really wanted to parody Hollywood romantic comedies then Amy Poehler is miscast  she isn't pretty enough to be a lead in an actual Hollywood romantic comedy and would likely end up playing the sjazzy best friend.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, has the leading man good looks but he isn't capable of elevating weak material, which is what he's stuck with here.Some people may be able to get on the same wavelength as They Came Together but I found it to be an unfunny drag that was torture to sit through  I actually stopped the movie several times and pondered whether it was worth trying to make it to the end or not.

"As a fan of political dramas, I decided to give &#34;Crisis&#34; a try because it looked like a very interesting premise.  Plus, being an X Files junkie, I was curious about Gillian Anderson's return to network TV.  Those jazzumptions did hold...for about two episodes.  After that, unfortunately, the show turns into a standard crime procedural lacking any sort of &#34;new ground&#34;.After the first two episodes of &#34;Crisis&#34;, I thought that I had found the next great political drama.  A group of high society prep students on a school field trip (one being the son of the President of the United States) are kidnapped and held hostage.  It is very interesting to see the different dynamics between the students and how they all react a little bit differently to the situation.  Even the heavily advertised Gillian Anderson return is a hit, as her character adds a toughness angle to the show that seems intriguing.Sadly, that is where the innovation of this show ends.  For the next 3 4 episodes, it turns into a complete procedural.  It has the stereotypical &#34;one male, one female F.B.I. agent&#34; (played by Lance Gross & Rachael Taylor) premise, and follows a &#34;one parent of a hostage each week&#34; approach to storytelling.  It is sad, because had the show runners been able to focus on the relationships between the teen hostages themselves, THAT is where the interesting material was.  As soon as the focus shifted to the parents, it became tedious and un inspiring.  Even Anderson's character has been pretty much in invisible since those first couple episodes.I compare &#34;Crisis&#34; to a show like &#34;Intelligence&#34; on CBS.  Both shows had great kernels of concepts ideas, but instead of truly breaking ground with original storytelling, the networks instead shoe horn those interesting plots into tired TV storytelling conventions.  Both shows were also advertised as something almost completely different from what they turned out to be.  Much like &#34;Intelligence&#34;, I would be surprised if &#34;Crisis&#34; gets a renewal for a second season.

"Yes, the show is underwhelming. It's MUCH more low budget than what I was expecting. Hardly ever see a flying car or really cool special effects, but the show isn't all bad.I think Dorian is interesting. It's cool to see new things he can do as the episodes continue. And he's funny. Rudy is a good character, and he's also funny. Karl Urban as Kennex is sometimes just tolerable, and very wooden. But, in other episodes his performance is decent, and he has some good lines.Sometimes the plots are pretty good. The show is never awesome, but that's alright. A few episodes have been quite good. However, I was hoping for a stronger plot thread that continued through each episode. It's disappointing that there is not a stronger, continuing plot thread. This show has the potential to be a lot better than it is.I do appreciate that there are still some programs on TV that don't have loads of sex and gore.

"""Brake"" is another in a recent string of claustrophobic thrillers set entirely in one small confined space. Instead of the ""buried alive"" aspect, though, the hero of this piece is locked into a transparent box and held in the trunk of a vehicle. And as he tries to figure out just what is going on, it seems that the outside world is alive with terror plots and conspiracies. Just why is this guy locked up? Who is doing it? And what do they need from him? These are the questions that Stephen Dorff wrestles with as he remains the sole character on screen for the entire length of the movie. When the audience is trapped with the film's protagonist in a stagnant space, there is a tendency (if not done correctly) for the picture to get monotonous. ""Brake"" does a serviceable job of keeping things interesting, but mostly because it adds dangers that are patently ridiculous.Slight Spoilers:I mean really, who would believe that ANYONE would be carrying around a load of bees?And the box has the capacity to fill with liquid in the trunk of a car? Where's it coming from?End of Slight SpoilersReally, though, I didn't expect too much from ""Brake."" I just wanted to be entertained. The movie starts with an intriguing premise so I overlooked many of the wild plot developments because I was genuinely interested to see where this journey would take me. While not exactly riveting throughout, it made for a perfectly pjazzable popcorn movie. Dorff seems to be taking on more and more of these direct to DVD type roles (although this had a small release, it feels direct to DVD) and I'm not sure why. He's actually quite good here as he becomes increasingly unhinged. And he is the absolute center of the piece. Although the movie boasts names such as Tom Berenger and Chyler Leigh, they get but a moment of screen time. No, this is Dorff talking on a CB radio followed by Dorff talking on a cell phone followed by Dorff talking through a tube. I think you get the idea, it's all Dorff!The principle storyline revolves around a political conspiracy and, never for a minute, did I believe any of it. Still, I'd have rated this 3 (possibly 3 1 2) stars if not for the ending. You think the rest of the movie is silly? Just wait for the twists (there are more than one, that's all I say). Any goodwill I had toward ""Brake"" flew out the window with these nonsensical revelations. They turn this mildly engaging movie into one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in a while. None of these last minute twists can withstand even the slightest intellectual scrutiny and the definitely put the brakes on my enjoyment of the movie!

"When last year I saw the poster for this then yet to released movie at my local independent movie theatre, I was thrilled and really couldn't wait to see this, since I was such a fan of the book upon which this isbased. Then for whatver reason the movie never came to the theatres here in Cincinnati, so I recently checked out the DVD.""Freakonomics"" (93 min.) tries to bring onto the screen pretty much the same stories that the co authors brought us in the book. Most of the stories as brought in the movie actually are condensed and gloss over a lot of the details, in particular the data supporting the seemingly unexpected results from the ""hidden side of everything"". That proves to be a fatal flaw for the movie, even if the movie is not bad as entertainment.

"When was the last time this show was scary?  The biters have become mere pests. They are no longer a real threat. Little Carl is much more frightening.  By Episode 13 of Season 3, dealing with the Zs has deteriorated into a game. When the zombies are treated like gnats, it's time to play the theme from ""Jaws.""  Dudes, the shark has been jumped.And what's with all this yakking. Is this The Talking Dead?  Episode 13 seems to be where things are bottoming out. Not one real fright in the hour. Rick and the Governor, still battling it out for Who is Nuttier, are at a sitdown at the behest of Andrea, a woman who can't see the forest or the trees. Her boyfriend keeps his zombie daughter in the breakfront, has a collection of living zombie heads in the parlor, stages gladiator fights with zombies, and she doesn't get it that he's a little, you know, odd?Anyway, the episode starts out reasonably well: Old Herschel is along as Rick's protection because when the going gets tough, there isnothing like an elderly one legged man to provide back up, right?  But intriguingly, he has a gun and a knife strapped to his stump. Points for originality. And the Guv has a gun hidden under the sit down table.  Okay, looks like we are going to have some action...the conflict will be resolved and one of the boys won't be going home. Yeah...dream on.  Rick and the Governor stare at one another meaningfully.  For minutes on end. And they talk. And they talk and they talk. Come on...we are not watching this show for the dramatic insights into their characters, we know the governor is insane and is determined to wipe out Rick's people, so why watch him pretend otherwise for most of the episode?  Enough dialogue...we want action, chills, terror. Otherwise we'd be watching some hip Indie film with Steve Buscemi and Christopher Walken. And when some Zs do show up, dispatching them is almost an afterthought.  Enter the shark.In addition to Rick and Guv's talk fest, other even more boring characters are highlighted.  Maggie and Glenn do their best to turn this into As The Zombie Turns as they examine where their relationship went wrong and then have a little gratuitous sex to keep those teenage boys tuning in.  Glenn is my least favorite character. He gets everything wrong and, when left in charge of the prison, decides to abandon his post and have a make out session with his galpal instead.  Ah, young love.  If a zombie singles him out, I will gladly provide condiments.Merle, the one armed psychopath, is the only one who makes sense, wanting to take out the governor by sneaking up on him and whacking him. But the politcally correct Glenn won't stand for this. Another reason to dislike the little squirt.The show is becoming painful.  Let's have some more chills. I want the Walking Dead to scare me to death, not bore me to death. For a show that started out so well...the first episode was enough to induce nightmares, it's now a parody.  Please, please, scare the daylights out of us again. Make the biters scary again, not just little flies to annoy and be swatted away.  This may be the problem...the make up people have so many great ideas for creating rotted corpses, they have overdone it. Too many zombies and we get too used to them.  One zombie shuffling toward you in the dark, arms outstretched, coming at you slowly  but inexorably as you look around and see no way out...that's terrifying. But endless swarms of them shambling along and getting their poor little noggins busted over and over and over again?  Not so much.  Give us the Horror.

"O Happy Day! As presented in widescreen, here's Season 2 of Bones. The great news is that there's no slack off at all from season one's most excellent run. Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama, humor, pathos, and tenuous romance. Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth (David Boreanaz) continue to dazzle as television's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person, Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark. She remains dispjazzionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail, the truth. As always, her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases. As ever, the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the, to her, bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum. Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones' supremely confident exterior. She and Boreanaz are magical, and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode, but that doesn't keep me from being sofa ed in rapt attention. This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth's: ""Keep talking. I'll catch up."" The mysteries are compelling enough, but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements, it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more. The squints, while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks, are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters. The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky, bolstered by this season's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal, Stephen Fry, and the wonderful Patricia Belcher (as no nonsense attorney Caroline Julian). It must be noted that T.J. Thyne (Hodgins) and Michaela Conlin (Angela) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls, beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan (Taylor) as Brennan's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute, with whom Bones instantly clashes. Then mix in some office romances (except the one we're hankering for). Offer up a serial killer or two. And, thru all the cases she works on, Bones still fixates on her mother's unsolved murder and her father's disappearance. On this, some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are ""The Truth in the Lye"" (Tub of goo!! So cool tub of goo!! To quote Bones: ""Even for me, this is disgusting.""), ""The Woman in the Sand"" (Booth goes ultimate fighting and, Omigawd, Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress!), ""Aliens in a Spaceship"" (Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out; raw emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel), the nerve wracking ""The Blonde in the Game"" and its equally harrowing follow up ""The Man in the Cell"" features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season's ""A Man on Death Row"") and the season ender ""Stargazer in the Puddle"" (Bones learns more about her mother).Special Features include optional episode commentaries on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" (with Emily Deschanel) and on ""Stargazer in a Puddle."" Boreanaz doesn't commentate this time; perhaps, his effort last season was deemed too loopy. Disc 6 offers ""The Memories in the Season"" featurette; ""Visceral Effects: The Digital Illusions of Bones"" featurette; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers; and the gag reel.By the way, the episode commentary on ""The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House"" reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season. Does that mean there'll be 23 episodes in season 3? One hopes (but doubts).","""Talk to me, squints. As close to English as possible."",",1190073600,"09 18, 2007"

While there though they discover she isn't what she seems. This woman is actually a visitor from another world. Slowly she begins to believe that she is actually a human and this feeling begins to change everything for her. This is a very difficult movie to explain. The best way I can do it is to say that this is a version of Species as if it was directed by Stanley Kubrick.  There is very little dialog and the movie is very deliberate in its pacing.

"Nashville, as the name implies, is a Nashville based fictional drama television series about up and coming, and, already famous country music singers. It airs on ABC.Season 1 introduces some of our favorite characters and the first bits of trouble and drama. Connie Britton is amazing as country sensation Rayna James. One of my top two for this series. Rayna is an established artist, mother of 2 and daughter of the Mayor all while remaining very grounded and stoic. She struggles with folks at the label, whom she feels is stifling her career.Then there is energetic and always stirring up something Juliette Barns played by Hayden Panettiere. Juliette is a young, country pop star, so to speak, and she is ready to have legend status. In her ambition she is always leaping without looking first. Then forever trying to live down an event she really isn't bothered by to begin with.Deacon Claybourne (Charles Esten) is Rayna's long time front guitar man and former flame, though she is married to Teddy Conrad (Eric Close.) There is always some tension between the two as they vie for her time and attention. Rayna will have to make some changes to hold peace in her life.A few of our newcomers in the world of country music include Scarlett (Clare Bowen), Avery (Jonathan Jackson) and Gunner (Sam Palladio.) And yes, there is definitely some heat and friction with these young people out there trying to make it. The drama is there, but these kids always go back to the music. I think it is part of what makes them endearing.I really enjoy the acting on Nashville. Especially that of Britton and Esten. I feel they make their roles so believable and interesting.

"A Little Bit Zombie (Casey Walker, 2012)Okay, I admit it: I'm a sucker for stupid zombedies. You make a silly movie and you put some corporeal undead in it, and baby, I am there, with bells on. And I'm not going to tell you that A Little Bit Zombie is the best of its breed, but if you're looking for a zombedy and you've seem all the cljazzics one too many times, dialing this one up will not disappoint you in the least.Veteran TV director Walker's first theatrical feature gives us soon to be married couple Steve (Without a Paddle: Nature's Calling's Kristopher Turner) and Tina (Insomnia's Crystal Lowe), who have rounded up their wedding party and dragged them to a remote cabin so obsessive Tina can put everyone through their paces. Problem is, there's a zombie outbreak in the area. Professional zombie hunters Max (The Dark's Stephen McHattie) and Penelope (jPod's Emilie Ullerup) think they've got it contained, but a mosquito bit one of the zombies just before it got dispatched, and when it subsequently bites Steve, he starts feeling a bit peaked, looking worse, and developing a craving for brains (which, conveniently, can be fed by local grocer Cap'n Cletus [X Men's George Buza], who happens to be a cerebrum gourmand himself). When Max finds out about Steve's ""condition"", he's all for dispatching the groom to be with a shotgun to the skull, while research student Penelope believes Steve could be the means to cure the zombie plague once and for all.It's predictable, it's dumb, and it's funny. If you're a fan of the zombedy, this is going to be a hit; if you're not, you can safely pjazz on it without feeling like you're missing much, but some surprisingly good acting (Buza's scenes are comedy gold, every one of them), solid comic timing on everyone's parts, and the always welcome presence of Stephen McHattie, who's just started getting noticed as the fearsome talent he is in the past five years or so, make this one worth your time. ***","Predictable, but fun.",1365292800,"04 7, 2013"

"""Klondike"" is a six part miniseries that aired on the Discovery Channel over three nights. From executive producer Ridley Scott, I had very high hopes that ""Klondike"" would be the must see dramatic event of the television season. I have heard many people completely dismiss the program due to factual errors and or inaccuracies. These complaints are, perhaps, more valid since this appeared on the Discovery Channel which is not known for scripted programming but for documentary like productions (in fact, this was touted as their first scripted miniseries endeavor). I, as a casual viewer, was not particularly bothered about the precise factual details presented but was willing to accept this as a purely fictional entertainment loosely based on real life events. So that is how I am judging ""Klondike."" As the series begins, I thought that there was enormous potential in the storyline and I really enjoyed the set up. For me, though, the longer the show progressed, the less I liked it. There are plenty of good elements (notably the filming location and several strong performances), but I found the plotting and characters to be very inconsistent  almost maddeningly so.As the series opens, we meet our intrepid hero Bill Haskell (Game of Throne's Richard Madden) as he and his best friend (an effective Augustus Prew) decide to embark on an adventure to make them rich beyond their wildest dreams. Near the turn of the century (late 1890's), they join the fray of fortune hunters exploring the uncharted Yukon Territory. As they make their way across the vast wilderness, the scenery is impressive and ""Klondike"" is absolutely captivating. Eventually, they reach their destination and face challenges that are both unforeseen and somewhat nefarious. This is an untamed country and the settlement exists in a survival of the fittest mode (think Deadwood with less grit, believability, or expletives). I was all in on the first two hours of ""Klondike"" despite its flaws because I wanted to see what was going to transpire. A devastating event rocks Madden's world and his existence turns to finding justice in an outlaw land.In my opinion, it is this development (no spoilers here) that largely derails ""Klondike."" Instead of being a grittily realistic depiction of a harsh life, the series seems to want to hedge its bets by adding a mystery component as well as the requisite romance. The remaining four hours have Madden playing amateur sleuth as opposed to focusing on the gold rush elements that should have been central to the plot. It's a big miscalculation, because Madden is supposed to be our entry point into this world. Many of the supporting players are ill defined, even great actors end up in one dimensional portrayals. Tim Roth (who can do no wrong in my book) gets a showy role as a villain, and while it may be fun, it lacks any real depth. Sam Shepherd plays the local clergy, but it never feels particularly integral to the plot. Abbie Cornish is, perhaps, the show's second lead and she can be quite good. Although the screenplay puts her into some soapy situations, she is one of three characters that get real development. I also liked Tim Blake Nelson, who ends up working with Madden.In the end, nothing about ""Klondike"" really gelled for me. The Yukon Gold Rush is such a great setting for a compelling story. But this mix of fact and fiction really never capitalized on the potential. ""Klondike"" does look great, but it left me emotionally disconnected. If it was half the running time, I might have enjoyed it more. But in six parts, there is just no reason why the characters couldn't be developed more adequately. I wanted to love ""Klondike,"" but I just wearied of it and never felt that the time commitment had the dramatic pay off that I was looking for.

"Cowboy Sheriff, based I'm presuming on a series of books.Likeable cast, plots ramble all over the place.  See the town is close to an Indian Reservation and they manage to bring in some Native Indian rituals, superstitions, etc. at least in the first two series.(Basically murder mysteries, makes one wonder the size of the graveyards in these towns.  I always wondered how the graveyards in Cabot Cove (Murder She Wrote), must dwarf the size of the town...  Getting to be the same thing here.  Although they do burn the bodies in above ground Indian Crematoriums, so there's that.).Anyway, sometime in the past the Sheriff's wife was killed;  He indicated to the townsfolk that it was death from cancer, but instead it was some sort of stabbing.  So, a lot of the plot slowly (and I do mean slowly) rotates around that base mystery.Acting, not the worst, when it's got it's game on (about 3 4 of the time) the plots manage to make sense, and have a bit of surprise in them.  Character development is an on going affair.It's like waiting for the race car to leave the starting line.  You suspicion it is a fine car, could win a race, but so far it's been in neutral with someone revving the engine every once in awhile.Slow paced (did I mention that?), and from that perspective sort of relaxing and enjoyable.

"At the age of 34, Aaron Paul is quite the accomplished actor &#8211; at least on the small screen.  You may catch him here and there in various roles, but for the most part, Paul is best known for his outstanding performance in the AMC drug drama, Breaking Bad.  For five years, Paul portrayed the quirky Jesse Pinkman, and earned himself several prominent awards, along with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor.  However, with Breaking Bad having reached its conclusion, it only seems like a natural decision for Paul to try his luck on the big screen.  However, not every successful TV actor translates well to the grander stage of film.  And, if Need for Speed is any indication about the direction of Paul&#8217;s future in film &#8211; he might want to start rethinking his character choices&#8230;Directed by Scott Waugh (Act of Valor) and based on the popular Electronic Arts video game, Need for Speed stars Aaron Paul as a garage owner and former racecar driver, Tobey Marshall.  He, along with a handful of his closest friends, run the garage &#8211; but Tobey has a hard time finding the money to keep it open.  He occasionally takes part in street races for side money, yet it&#8217;s never enough to maintain a level of financial comfort.After successfully winning his latest street race, Tobey and his team are approached by Tobey&#8217;s old rival, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper) &#8211; a famed driver and car tycoon.  Prior to his death, car creator Carol Shelby had been working on a special, supped up version of the Shelby Mustang, however, he wasn&#8217;t able to complete his work.  Brewster enlists Tobey to complete the Mustang, at which point he will pay them a quarter of the car&#8217;s worth &#8211; between two and three million dollars.  But, egos get in the way and during a street race between Tobey and Dino &#8211; tragedy lands Tobey in jail for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit.After doing time in jail, Tobey openly breaks parole and heads from New York to California &#8211; but not before enlisting the help of high end car dealer, Julia Maddon (Imogen Poots).  She is able to lend him the same Shelby Mustang from his partnership with Dino and he plans to use it to race Dino in a private, invitation only winner take all street race &#8211; coordinated by an internet racing guru, Monarch (Michael Keaton).  Tobey also has revenge on the mind and plans to prove his innocence while taking Dino down in the process.In the spirit of the Fast and the Furious franchise, Need for Speed attempts to establish characters with a heavy dose of racing in their backdrop.  Unfortunately, Need for Speed doesn&#8217;t present a substantial alternative to the Fast franchise, featuring generic individuals that supposedly have credibility, egos, and reputations &#8211; but only because they are force fed to the audience without substantiated proof.  Even the dialogue between the characters is bothersome, as they spend far too much time and effort rattling off bland one liners and partaking in soap opera ish melodrama.For someone as talented as Aaron Paul, he is terribly under utilized in the lead role of this lackluster plot.  In fact, I dare say Paul is not ready to be a lead actor based on the result of this film.  He goes from a supremely popular television drama to a disappointing undertaking &#8211; and it&#8217;s hard to imagine a role of this nature helping him further his career.  His character comes off as a bit of fraud &#8211; and at times, his delivery is terribly fake.  Even Paul&#8217;s alleged rivalry with the film&#8217;s villain, portrayed by Dominic Cooper, is dependent on false, over embellished egos and the chemistry is just not there.  Obviously, most of us know Paul is a credible actor, meaning the writing is where the fault lies in this presentation.Meaningful character interaction is completely sacrificed for the sake of adding a near endless about of car chases &#8211; inevitably causing more cut scenes of which the eye is able to keep track.  There are quite a few outstanding cars worth your admiration in this flick, including the decked out Shelby Mustang GT500, plus the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento, and Koenigsegg Agera R.  But, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be a racing movie until they were all prominently wrecked at high speed &#8211; except for the Koenigsegg, which is ridiculously important to the outcome of the far fetched story.Regardless of how this film plays our, the countless holes in the plot are undeniable.  In one particular scene, Tobey&#8217;s team is traveling next to him in a truck in order to refuel his car, so he doesn&#8217;t have to stop and lose any more precious time (as if it takes more than just a couple of minutes to fill up).  In any event, mere moments later Tobey and his pjazzenger, Julia (who apparently has nothing better to do than to go on joy rides with convicts), randomly stop for gas.  Before, time was of the essence, but now it&#8217;s okay to stop?  Come on?  Seriously?  Naturally, there&#8217;s a police office just happens to be in the gas station parking, who predictably chases them around for a few minutes.  Go figure.Overall, Need for Speed as downright ridiculous in every possible manner of thinking &#8211; even more so than the Fast franchise.  In the real world, Tobey Marshall would have been quickly apprehended in OJ Simpson fashion, but the odds of him going to jail for his alleged &#8220;crime&#8221; in the first place is next to nothing anyway (since there&#8217;s traffic cameras everywhere these days).  This terribly scripted film does a marvelous job of making decent actors look like daytime television actors &#8211; not to mention there is absolutely nothing about this film that drastically ties itself to the popular video game franchise (and video game film adoptions have a history of being terrible to begin with).  About the only reason you should see this film is if you&#8217;re a diehard fan of Aaron Paul or simply like to see eye popping, ridiculously fast cars.GRADE: D+FNDNreview.com",'Need for Speed' a poorly structured melodrama,1394841600,"03 15, 2014"

"The film opens with people screaming and running around getting killed by an off screen slasher. After that brief teaser opening, 5 girls take off to go camping. Kate (Zara Phythian) is five days back from Afghanistan (guess how her training plays in this). The girls drive, then leave their convertible with the top down to go hike and camp several hours away. The girls are armed with shorts, boots, back packs, and military issue undergarments that can double as a swim suit. It isn't long before they meet some cute boys and become flirty.If you were awake the first few minutes then you know where this goes.This is a &#34;me too&#34; woods slasher. It offers nothing new.

"The premise, a couple of future slackers become unwilling minions of the evil galactic conglomerate, is so clich&eacute;, so uber PC, so lefty Hollywood snarky inside joke stupid it might have been funny. Except that the jokes fall flat or are flat out distasteful (""I'll get you a hooker with five vaginas""). For heroes we have a fat, dorky stoner and his friend, an even more pathetic, down on his luck looser who is looking for love. Hilarity does not ensue. The highlight of the episode, and the stand out in the cast, is the rebel chick. Unfortunately she comes with a stereotypical self absorbed, narcissistic pretty boy sidekick  a total poser who loves to get stoned and quote Chairman Mao. Instead of being witty Dark Minions is banal; instead of being edgy it is foul mouthed; instead of being good it is simply bad. What makes shows like Big Bang Theory geeky and good is they have real science jokes and plot devices, matched with sympathetic characters possessing depth and believability. This pilot has none of those characteristics.","Needs work, alot of work",1367193600,"04 29, 2013"

"I wonder who teaches the male actors, the guy who plays the Shane character especially, how to do facial and head acting? My point: This guy Jon is pathetic with his dipping his head, cocking it to one side, his body postures   and no, this is not the character, but Jon's acting. Jon was so overwhelmingly melo dramatic that I comsidered him a rookie given a chance at the big leagues. His silly acting got in the way of the story. Too many of the actors are too obvious in their stud acting. Superiors actors could have made the series worth the money spent. Superior actors, though, would not have participated. I suggest that one pay $1.00 per episode. No more than $1.00. But, be prepared for silly acting too often from Jon who plays Shane. The director created a silly and immature character in the boy, so much so that it is impossible to believe. Therefore, a primary character of the final several episodes are fluff. I say that about 50% of the episodes are worth watching, which is saying that the other episodes are fluff to make up some extra dollars. The fluff will make one laugh though.

"While my over view of the series stays the same as my previous review of the first season I was somewhat amazed at myself on finding the series to be entertaining enough to get the second season set and for the price pretty affordable too.  I can't say if it's the actual fact that they are filming in Hawaii instead of downtown L.A. like half of CBS shows are some of the episodes have gotten to me but still the scenery and action in half the season does make you want to continue to watch the series.  I still say it's a clone of the previous shows that have come before it CSI NCIS Criminal Minds but it looks like the writers have started using their higher brain functions in a few of the episodes and especially with the dialogue which has improved from the first season. So if you already got the first season I say for the price the set is going for now the second season is a pretty good add on to your t.v. show dvd collection.  Also after watching the first episode of the third season I've already decided this is the last set I'll get of this series, while overall it can be entertaining after seeing how the story seems to be going through loop after loop with the characters and their situation I can tell this is fast becoming CSI:Las Vegas 2 and for that small smidgen of enjoyment I'm getting from this series I have to stop it at this season sadly before I become more disillusioned then I already am with the series.",While Still Campy Actually Have Begun To Enjoy It Somewhat,1348272000,"09 22, 2012"

They were never 'really' married, it is just an 'arrangement'. After 20 years, during the Reagan presidency, the sleepers are asked to stop sleeping. Much action happens.

"In 1972, Linda Boreman, better known to the world by her stage name, Linda Lovelace, took the adult film industry by storm as the first adult film actress to hit the mainstream.  Even though she only spent 17 days in the industry, she still became an overnight sensation, earning so much attention that she also appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.  However, her most notable contributions came long after her career was over, writing several best selling autobiographies, including Out of Bondage and Ordeal   both chronicling her life and the events leading up to her brief adult film career.  In the years that followed her brief stint, she become a spokesperson for the anti pornography movement, and traveled across the United States giving lectures, speaking out against pornography and spousal abuse.  The events of her life are the bases for the new bio picture, Lovelace.Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, the writers and directors of the bio picture, Howl, both write and direct Lovelace, starring Amanda Seyfried as Linda Lovelace.  Based on a true story, the film begins with Linda living at home with her parents, Dorothy (Sharon Stone) and John (Robert Patrick).  Still a young and impressionable woman, Linda meets Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard), a bar owner deep in debt that she eventually marries, and whom also persuades her to start a career in the profitable adult film industry.  After her adult film debut becomes a mjazzive success, she decides she wants nothing to do with the pornography industry, as this film depicts the events that took place before, during and after the release of one of the highest grossing pornographic films of all time.  Juno Temple, Adam Brody, James Franco, and Hank Azaria also star in supporting roles.There's no doubt the story of Linda Lovelace is a series sad and unsettling events   jazzuming things went as depicted in her books and in this film.  However, this film tells a story that paints Linda Lovelace as a completely innocent bystander, which is difficult to believe and even harder to relate to.  At no point over the course of this film will viewers look at the main character of this film and believe for one second that she was forced into a life of (apparent) sexual slavery.  There have been plenty of individuals and news stories over the years that have disputed Linda's version of these events, painting her as anything but a tragic figure.  Clearly, it's difficult to conceive that she was completely unwilling to partake in the events that thrust her into the spotlight.  While this information may not have anything to do with this film, it does share a great deal of intel about the person writers and directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman wanted Linda Lovelace to be portrayed as over the course of this film.Outside of the questionable events, Lovelace is a quality bio picture, which manages to tell an interesting story about a young woman that received an abnormal amount of attention.  Amanda Seyfried's performance as Linda Lovelace is above average, yet severely lacks the emotion of someone that is supposedly being forced to do something against her will.  The evolution of this character is apparently in the cracks as this film jumps from year to year on a whim.  Lovelace's first husband, Chuck Traynor, is captured as a much more believable and emotional figure than Lovelace herself.  Traynor, portrayed by Peter Sarsgaard, is a far more interesting character, filled with anger, rage, and greed.  Although his actions are deplorable in this film, he was clearly in touch with the adult film industry, managing Lovelace and later Marilyn Chambers   who many call the second biggest porn star of the period.Lovelace features an ensemble cast, most notably Sharon Stone as Linda Lovelace's mother, Dorothy.  Stone is basically impossible to recognize (unless you already knew it was her) as the strict, unforgiving mother that could have easily helped Linda, yet decided to turn her back.  Other noteworthy performances come from James Franco, who makes a brief appearance as Hugh Hefner.  The Playboy mogul also apparently had a pulse on the adult film industry, and quickly took a liking to Linda Lovelace and eventually had her posing for his magazine.  And, while the cast is rounded out by a handful of familiar faces, including Robert Patrick, Juno Temple, and Hank Azaria, the most amusing and entertaining portrayal of this group comes from the former star of The O.C., Adam Brody   who does his best impression of the fructuous adult film performer, Harry Reems.Overall, Lovelace manages to pull off a believable 70s flick, reminiscent of a films, including Boogie Nights and 54.  Like much of that era, Lovelace incorporates the ""sexual revolution,"" mixed with drugs and individual exploration.  Unfortunately, bio picture films have a way of telling a one sided depiction of real life events, and while Linda Lovelace did make a career of speaking out against the adult film industry, she was a willing partaker in her 17 days of poor decision making.  The odds of most movie goers finding any sort of enjoyable substance in this film is negligible, meaning this film will hardly garner anyone's attention   outside of current porn stars and people familiar with Linda Lovelace.  Yes, the acting is enjoyable to an extent.  However, the story is not.  Odds are this film will turn out to be nothing more than a desperate rental for a small few, while its potential for being a future (and severely edited) Lifetime flick is great.GRADE:  C+FNDNreview.com","'Lovelace' provides an interesting, informative biopic",1376870400,"08 19, 2013"

It is obvious from those of us watching that Mari does not want to have another child but is too much of a coward to come out and say it. We keep hearing about how money is so important to them, but each wife has moved into a McMansion. Kody continues to be useless except to knock people up. Although, if the wives want to start a business, they might want to think of Kody hair care products. I keep waiting for Kristine or Janelle to say ""I'm outta here."" The kids are coming across as complete brats. To top it off we got the creep factor of having to hear about Robyn's 'first time."" Can we say too much information!!

"Quick Overview: After a nuclear crisis the human race took to space for hundreds of years. Running out of resources they have quickly developed a one strike rule for criminals.

"I don't know of any heterosexual man who is not a Scarlett Johansson fan, but I could be wrong.  This may be rare, but I buy watch movies based on the actors actresses rather than the plot.  Obviously, it's hit or miss since not all can be blockbusters.  This one was definitely a miss.  As some posters have already mentioned, there is very little dialogue, a whole lot of SJ looking blankly into space, heavy Scottish accents, and unfortunately a lot of nude men scenes.  The only consolation was that SJ displayed herself in all her glory in a few scenes.  I understand that the female alien role, that SJ played, had a self awareness awakening towards the end, but the journey getting there was excruciating and the ending landed with a dull thud.I must add that the Scottish landscapes and other scenes of life in the UK were spot on.  I lived in the UK for 5 years and it brought back many memories of the mostly dismal weather and the Mom and Pop grocery stores complete with bland food   God Bless America!Unfortunately, I'm not an indie movie fan and cannot recommend this movie even for rental.

"First thing  I want to say regarding the new Universal Soldier movie is that it deserves credit for ripping off Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darknes"", if you're gonna steal, steal from the best, and stealing from Conrad takes  a lot of audacity. Now, of course, this is not Apocalypse Now, it is Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning, what are you expecting, surely not Coppola.The fourth in the popular, and admittedly superior action movie franchise. This is a departure from the previous entries. It actually tries to tell a story, something that it unfortunately fails at from time to time, but at least it tries. It comes across murky and confusing at times, but at least it dares to try something different.Up and coming martial arts film star Scott Adkins appears to be taking over the franchise as a wounded soldier  with amnesia who's family is murdered by Luc Deveroux (Jean Claude Van Damme). He doesn't understand why any of this happening or his involvement in the universal soldier program. So he goes down river, I mean he goes after Deveroux in search of answers and finds the once great action hero, a Kurtz like figure for the know awaken unisol soldiers.Making Van Damme something of a villain is into itself an inspired idea, like Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West. we are caught off guard. This is just part of the new darker approach to the series, which I full heartedly welcome.Directed by John Hyams, who helmed the worthy previous entry, he seems to have more ambition as a filmmaker than one might expect. He is a good craftsman, and here he shows real promise as a budding auter, at least in the action genre. Future projects, of which I don't know any, from him could be interesting, his father, Peter Hyams is a respectable action and thriller movie technician.Universal Soldier: Day of Reckonimg is full of brutal fights, that may turn off some viewers. The action is exciting and well paced, thogh. Adkins makes for an amiable  hero, and is at least as good as Jason Statham, he deserves a really good star vehicle, this isn't it, but it comes close.This franchise, like the universal soldiers themselves, seems to never die, and with so many lousy action flicks out there, a strong series like this could be rewarding for the correct audience. If your not that audience, don't bother you know who you are, but if you've been waiting for a good guns and fists action movie since the Expendables 2, this should fill the void, and it actually manages to do something a little different even approaching a respectable dramatic film.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",heart of darkness,1362441600,"03 5, 2013"

"We're only two episodes into this new NBC drama and it's already fallen apart at the seams. The show opens with Cuaron's directorial trademark of a technically clever tracking shot and after that it devolves into an incredibly dull series of totally unbelievable chases with absolutely zero character growth or plot development.The girl is blessed with some sort of telekinetic capability that she uses whenever the plot needs an escape catch. With this superpower, she should be the least vulnerable human on the planet but instead succumbs to an inept series of bad guys who can't decide whether to capture or kill her. She also seems to &#34;sense&#34; people's problems to get the B plot of the week going so she can run around helping people in between the good guys messing things up.The writing is on par with a first draft from a mediocre screenwriting student at a bad film school and it's almost inconceivable it was used for production. Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script (&#34;You're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution.&#34;   &#34;You were trained at Quantico and now you're working on the Tate case&#34;). Hardly anything is said that isn't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm's way, except when they use their own near telepathic knowledge to protect her. The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it (hey, there's a bag of money on a  fire escape in New York that's still there) and gives the audience no idea of where it's going beyond &#34;we're going to the safe house&#34; or &#34;we're going to Philadelphia&#34;   why not let's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun? Oh, and then major characters disappear   the laughably bad jazzjazzin from the pilot presumably didn't test well with the audience, even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys, bad guys (Kyle MacLachlan phones it in) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere. They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we're at the end of the episode. And there's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer thin plot forward so very, very slowly. There hasn't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden, the dialog is stilted, the fight scenes are horribly shot, there no tension, there's no suspension of disbelief and there's no plot. How can it get any worse? Cuaron just won an Oscar but I suspect he's now lending his name like &#34;Steven Spielberg Presents&#34;   take away his and JJ Abrams' writing credits and here you have a show that would otherwise simply never be aired. It's a total train wreck of irredeemably poor writing and production that's reminiscent of the worst days of the Glen A Larson's factory weeklies.

"Okay, ""we're not supposed to be here""...  we get it.  Too bad the producers didn't take the advice of their own tag line and reconsider ever creating this ridiculous show.  I wonder how many devout Stargate fans would have been willing to make a monetary contribution to MGM for an episodic solution to SGU. Specifically, if the Wraith were to ambush the Destiny and life suck these miserable characters right out of the Stargate franchise. Please be aware, this is not Stargate; it's Stargate trying to be Battlestar Galactica trying to be Lost and ends up being just more mindless drama except that it's in outer space.I'll give ya a couple of examples how this series differs from the other two.  In SG1 there was an underlying sub plot through most of the series' 10 years, involving serious emotions between O'Neil and Carter which tragically, they were unable to ever satisfy due to military restrictions against fraternization.  SGU flippantly adds a scene in the first five minutes of the first episode with one of the principal characters shagging a fellow officer in a broom closet.  That's one thing about the two original series, having served in the military myself, they always tried to portray the airforce with dignity and as much realism as sci fi can afford.  Another example is that SG1 and SG Atlantis never really discuss the matter of religion however neither did the writers feel the need to casually insult it and at one time Teal'c even questions his team whether they'd ever read the christian bible, which he had and apparently found to be rather profound.  SGU, on an early episode, cheerfully shows a catholic priest in the role of an abusive, chronic alcoholic.I wonder if the producers ever considered for one second that just maybe, Stargate fans liked a more positive and upbeat universe and for their characters to be compjazzionate and kind of heroic while not taking themselves too seriously.  Did they ever think that just maybe some people aren't interested in tuning in week after week to watch a group of angry jerks vying for power in a seemingly hopeless situation while being filmed by an apparently, paranoid camera crew.Gonna be completely honest here and say I only made it about halfway through season one because after watching this show for a few weeks I eventually gave up hoping it would all get better and just sank to the ground (kinda like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes) and railed at MGM: ""You maniacs!

"I felt that the new show &#34;Life&#34; was interesting. The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime. He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department. He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted. His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict. She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still, I found that the show was not compelling. I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little. Everyone loves a good mystery!Dani Reese's (the woman agent) emotional responses were confusing. On one hand, she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode, protecting him. She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others. She is a recovering addict. I would have disclosed Dani Reese's addiction history maybe a bit later. The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well, if he was going for the quirky Zen guy. But, the way he speaks (an attempt by the writers to make him interesting) is not that compelling. He has no censor and that's ok. But, the writer's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews (the main character played by Lewis) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress, why they would recast her is beyond me.",Meh,1191542400,"10 5, 2007"

"From a technical perspective, Steven Silver's ""The Bang Bang Club"" is a film that seems easy to love. Filled with grittily realistic action, earnest performances, and a topic that is inherently fascinating and dramatic  this had all the potential in the world. Covering the true story of a notorious group of photojournalists that immersed themselves in war torn South Africa during the violent post Apartheid era, these correspondents lived their lives on the front lines as the country unraveled in preparing for free elections. The danger, the pain, the thrills  it was a world unlike any other, but they thrived and excelled in the environment (two won Pulitzer prizes for their photos). But it also took a toll. The moral questions that arise when you report on atrocity but do nothing to stop it is certainly one of the weightier issues that might be explored in a biographical picture of this sort. And yet despite this fantastic source material, Silver's film seems strangely muted and impersonal.Without a doubt, I think this subject matter might have made for one of the most harrowing and powerful films of the year. Ryan Phillippe plays the lead, who begins the narrative as a new freelance photographer to the area. He immediately makes his mark as, against all better judgement, he wanders into a Zulu encampment and captures some incredibly intimate photos from the inside. His recklessness and bravado endear him to an established group of journalists, and they become fast friends. With Taylor Kitsch (Friday Night Lights) and Malin Akerman as the other more known names in the cast, everyone does well with the material that they are given  but something is missing. The screenplay never really lets us get close to the protagonists. What a tremendously fascinating group of people, but I still have no idea who they were as individuals. It's an incredibly disappointing oversight  because by remaining distant from the characters, the film lacks the devastating impact that would have made it unforgettable.Kitsch gets some of the film's more effective emotional moments, and is surprisingly convincing. Phillippe never really alters his demeanor and, without any character insight, tends to come across as one note. The other two members of the Bang Bang Club (as they became nicknamed in the press) are likable enough but are never developed with any sort of intimacy. You really want to understand these guys  what drove them into this life and this world and sustained them. But the film maintains a hands off approach to any psychological exploration. The movie is about the club and, yet, they remain aloof. I wanted to know more and I wanted to love this movie! But the lack of character development and insight diminishes the film's power. Still worth seeing, particularly if you have an interest in the topic, the movie might have been a devastating must see for adult audiences. As is, it is a rather impersonal (but well made) document of the times.

Sadly, I have reached the end of the line and was a little disappointed by the fact that they cancelled the show where there were still quite a few things to look forward to.In this last season, they changed a little Cal's character. Basically, he becomes a little more aggressive and obnoxious, which works great and Tim Roth has the ability to keep shining with his portrayal of the mesmerizing deception expert. I also liked the fact that they moved away from the FBI cases from season two and went back to the basics.There was some weird stuff going on with Loker, but that part of the story never went anywhere. Towards the end of the season we get introduced to a new character with quite a bit of potential, but I guess we will never find out if this is realized.

"I appreciate any effort to highlight racial and religious hostilities in a comedic light.  It's a difficult high wire act to address sensitive, and potentially offensive, topics through humor and so the fact that ""The Infidel"" does so overtly and aggressively was a pleasant surprise.  Absolutely terrific in conception, I was wholeheartedly with ""The Infidel"" at the beginning.  Played for over the top laughs by mining (almost cartoonishly at times) ethnic stereotypes, the film starts fast, funny, and unapologetically wrong (in a good way).  It is, however, a frenzied and challenging pace to match and soon the picture began to wane as the comedy becomes a little forced and the sweetly accepting message starts to materialize.  It's tolerance as preached by The Three Stooges  with its slapstick antics and requisite learning moments.The basis for the film is absolutely inspired!  A riff on social politics and an identity crisis comedy, we meet Omid Djalili as a Muslim family man.  A modern Muslim, to be sure, but not progressive enough that he can help getting into a feud with a Jewish man (Richard Schiff) at the drop of the hat.  As his son wishes to marry the daughter of an extremist leader, Djalili and family must prove their devoutness.  But this couldn't happen at a worse time because Djalili discovers that he is adopted and Jewish!  So funny, and played for big broad laughs, these are some of the finest moments in the film.  Naturally, much cliche'd hilarity ensues as he tries how to learn how to be Jewish from Schiff in comedic montages.  From here, the film ventures into love and understanding mode before wrapping things up with a rather tidy bow.  Not a particularly revelatory journey, when all is said in done, but amusing throughout.Everyone in the cast works very hard to pull off ""The Infidel.""  The performers are a talented and appealing bunch  no more so than lead Djalili who has learned his buffoonish bluster from the masters!  Ultimately, however, that's what it started to feel like for me  work.  Everything was in overdrive and, as they say in the theater, played to the rafters.  The outrageously funny moments gets watered down and become repetitive the longer the movie progresses.  And the ending, with its easy and convenient denouement, erases any conflict with some magical plot constructions.  I won't deny that seeing Schiff and Djalili spar isn't amusing because it is.  I did think that this terrific idea of a film, however, relied too much on obviousness and not enough on cleverness.  I look forward to the filmmaker's next effort as I think he's got much to say  but ""The Infidel"" (for me) started with a 4 star punch and ended in a 3 star, and very expected, finale.

"I've really enjoyed this series and especially this season, seeing the characters develop. I was only so so about the Inspector Morse series that preceded it.  Morse was just a little too much of a curmudgeon for me to warm to.  I suppose he was engaging, in his own way, but that series lacked the depth of the Inspector Lewis series that followed.&#34;Inspector Lewis&#34; carries on with the best elements of Inspector Morse stories, and Lawrence Fox's character brings a sweeter wit that takes the edge off many features he shares with the Inspector Morse character.  Fox's character's additional introspection is especially brilliant.The stories sometimes edged into such lurid areas, I was repulsed.  But, of course, crime should be repulsive.  That's where crime related TV shows have to walk a fine line between entertainment and integrity.Some episodes in this series (not just Season 2) were better than others.  However, the way the story concluded in 2013.. that was tremendous.  I was astonished when I read that a 2014 series was planned. I'm eager to see how they'll bring the cast back together, and if the show will continue its tradition of rich, challenging mysteries investigated by a bright, interesting team.Inspector Morse (with Lewis as his jazzistant) was endearing.Inspector Lewis (with Hathaway as his jazzistant) is charming and far more engaging on many levels.

"I really began watching Apt. 143 with some trepidation since I've seen some pretty bad POV found footage movies. The &#34;Bake street haunting&#34;, rushes to mind!  This was very different.  We don't have to wait patiently for 90% of the movie before the actions starts, it begins almost straightaway.  The acting is really above par for this sort of movie, although I'm not sure there was enough sympathy for any of the 'haunted' characters, but we're more involved with the paranormal investigators; at least it seemed to me we knew them better and had more insight into them as people than the films victims.  I viewed the father as weak, but then had a change of heart, he was just worn down, tired of dealing with so much drama and tragedy.  Even the strongest can have weak moments.  The children you will decide for yourself, I found the small boy cute and the teenager needing some 'old school' therapy.I loved the 'set', the apartment itself, very cool.  I found myself redecorating, painting and washing windows to the outside and the great french doors.  It was very turn of the century which for some will be creepy, the long, solitary hallway with rooms feeding off of it, the tall ceiling, arched in a few rooms gave great depth and atmosphere.  Everything was just a bit dingy, the wallpaper dated and dirty and the badly 'updated' lighting harsh, so all in all it put you on edge.  I would give the creep factor of this movie a solid 8, and overall scariness an honest 8 1 2.  It isn't bloody, no nudity or sex, some f bombs towards the end, and good honest performances with a satisfying ending mean you could do much worse than watch Apt. 143.

"After not watching a rotation of Survivor since the All Stars edition of 2004, I had some free time on my hands this fall and decided to jump back in.  After the initial excitement of watching the show again faded, I was quickly reminded of why I dropped out in the first place...until the final few episodes, when the drama kicks up to cljazzic levels.The &#34;gimmick&#34; of this season revolves around loved ones.  One returning player this time brings along a loved one to play with against depending on the tribal alignments.  Redemption Island is also brought back for this season, as is the hidden immunity idol.The trouble overall with this season is that its first half is quite bad.  It is all tears and whining.  The loved ones angle is (IMHO) a step back for this series, as it just leads to more contrived drama (something this show now produces enough of on its own).  I felt as if the &#34;what will my loved one think&#34; angle was beat over our heads time and time again.I also didn't like Redemption Island (this was the first season I've watched that featured its &#34;second chance&#34;).  The concept is novel, to be sure, but I liked the sheer drama of &#34;the tribe has spoken&#34; at each tribal council, with the voted out party not being able to return.I really began enjoying this 27th season in the final four or so episodes, when all the chaff was cut away and it turned into the Survivor I remembered from years ago.  Thus, it turned into at least an &#34;okay&#34; season.  2.5 stars would have been my exact rating, but I'll bump it up to a three due to the final few hours of drama.Basically, I felt that there was just too doggone much going on in &#34;Blood vs Water&#34; and all the craziness overshadowed a show that even to this day can produce some real drama.  I hope that cycle #28 goes back to all (or mostly) new competitors and favors a more traditional show structure.  Go away from Redemption Island in favor of more inventive reward challenges, and just lighten things up again.  Survivor is always best when focusing on the human drama.

"What was up with this season? They totally changed the hard work put into season 8 and changed everything! The whole Andy as the manager got threw out the window for some reason and he was gone for half the season. Then, his relationship with Erin got messed up in the process. Their characters were made for each other for like 3 seasons. They liked each other at different times secretly, and when they finally got together in Season 8, that was amazing! Now, in Season 9, they just threw away 3 seasons of hard work into the trash. WTF?Pam and Jim was pretty much a boring topic storyline in season 8, so there wasn't that much to talk about, but in season 9 they were constantly being shown. I didn't really care for their story as Jim and Pam had problems with their relationship and work. In this season, I would say 75% of it was about these two characters, trying to figuring about themselves so this is your A story right here.Now, your B story would be about everything else. Dwright is always in every show and I think it is because Andy was missing for half the season. Dwright is looking to become a family man and I thought this was the most interesting story that I liked this season. He wants to be with Angela, but she is in the pretend marriage with the senator. This goes on for a long time, until Dwright gets a new girlfriend and possible wife material. Then, at the end, he finally has to choose between his girlfriend or Angela. I would had chosen the new girl, because Angela is such a Bitch. But, okay, I could see why Dwright chose Angela.I didn't like Erin as much as I did in other seasons. Manly because her character got changed so much and Andy wasn't there and some other younger guy liked her. Those two as a couple just doesn't make any sense to me. Erin is a somewhat older than this young guy and she is at that stage were she going to get married soon. (I thought Andy was going to marry her.) The young guy is at that stage were she having fun and meeting a lot of girls still. Well, anyways, everything fall apart after one episode were Andy figures out a plan and to try to break make them feel bad about them being together, and after that they weren't really ever mention as a couple ever again. So, that story arc just closed off.I didn't really like the last episode. It wasn't as good because they needed to make Michael Scott do more than have him there and not say or do anything. All he did was smile like a crazy person and didn't say anything and it looked really weird. They should of had him do something funny, while he was there.I wouldn't recommend this season to anyone that actually liked season 8.

"The Magic of Belle Isle is one of those quiet movies that sneaks up on the viewer and captures one's attention, not letting go till the final credits roll. I only watched this yesterday, though I can't fathom why I let so much time lapse after its release before watching this stellar production. I absolutely love this film   it is beautiful, has an excellent cast, and touched my heart and soul.Morgan Freeman, one of my all time favorite actors, plays author Monte Wildhorn, a widower who has seen better days. Grieving the death of his beloved wife, Monte has not written in a while, and drowns his sorrow in drink. He rents a lakeside cabin for the summer in the lovely picture postcard town of Belle Isle, where his sole purpose is to wallow in self pity. Even his nephew, Henry (SNL constant, Kenan Thomson) can't seem to lift Monte out of the doldrums, and leaves him to his wallowing.Monte soon learns that he may want to shut out life, but life has other plans, in the form of next door neighbors comprising a single mom, Charlotte O'Neill (Virginia Madsen) and her three daughters, teenager Willow (Madeline Carroll), nine year old Finnegan (Emma Fuhrmann), and Flora (Nicolette Pierini). Charlotte is facing some challenges given her newly divorced status   her ex husband is never seen but viewers get the sense he is not a loving or engaged dad and teenager Willow rebels, acting like a brat and being mean to her mom and siblings.Despite himself, Monte is drawn to the O'Neill family   Finn pushes her way into his life after discovering Monte is famous for his Western novels, and pays him to teach her how to be creative. Charlotte senses Monte's underlying loneliness and invites him to dinner where Monte discovers Charlotte's talent for playing the piano. Gradually, these individuals form an informal family of sorts and Monte learns that life is certainly meant to be lived with purpose.This is a 'quiet' film   it moves at a leisurely pace but never feels like its plodding or meandering, there is a sense of purpose to every scene, even when secondary characters fill the screen, like the young mentally  challenged boy who befriends Monte and whom Monte takes under his wing, taking him on his weekly jaunts to the local grocery store, and being a real friend to someone who is so easily deemed invisible by many others in society .Both Morgan Freeman and Virginia Madsen are perfectly cast in their roles. They share a credible, heartwarming chemistry that is just warm and beautiful. The actress playing the role of Finn shows promise and delivers a spirited performance.There is a hint of romance here, but it is so subtly portrayed it never comes across as contrived, but as credible and oh so sweet. It is as much a tale of finding one's self as it is a story of two kindred souls, and I for one will be placing this on my ""worth repeat viewings"" list.",Lyrical and beautiful family drama,1352419200,"11 9, 2012"

"This outta be the typical review the lovers of this show are probably used to by now... surely enough, I love the movie, SG 1 & Atlantis... but cannot stand this one.Why? Well, I can't put enough emphasis on the word BORING. It sums up most of the shows. The first episode looked promising. The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy. There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies, attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens, and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate, they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart. From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of. The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast. Being that she looks 16, no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either... so it's a losing situation either way. Not to mention, she seems to be a BLEEP (rhymes with bore) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything, because I just don't care if they end up together or not when he's focusing on her during every waking moment he's not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad. In fact, no one is good at all. A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities, Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return, the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men, who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies, which the colonel does himself when he's not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan's and porking his missus. We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis, O'Neil, Carter, Sheppard etc... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you. I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1's team over everyone in this show!The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series, but i'm at the end of the first series now, and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season. So I just don't care if anyone new comes in for season 2. It blew it's chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I'm not sure it even comes down to bad writing, I think it's the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed. The biggest thing that's making it boring is the humor... or should I say, the lack of humor. This show has little to none at all. It's mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re route power to shields, weapons or  a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain. (it happens, sigh). The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining, winging and arguments between them, taking most of the focus off of any sci fi elements... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets, aliens, or interesting new technologies. There was something for everyone, old and young, sci fi fan or not in SG 1 and Atlantis, this SGU version, it's the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between. Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances, it just does not make the show better. Everything about it is wrong. It's not just the lack of humor, or adjusting to new cast members, it's the entire atmosphere of the show. With SG 1 and Atlantis, you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode... but watching SG U, you know what's going to keep happening, and the new things that do happen, all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro. Repetitive, boring and no imagination. You know from the first few episodes it's always going to be Eluid hacking this, Rush's new theory on that, whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is, moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest, and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom's put net nanny on their computers.I really can't say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be. Nothing at all worked. I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG 1 and Atlantis up. The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows... quite frankly, if it does get made, I couldn't care less if SG U has anything to do with it, as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe, the actual universe, not the show with that name.And another thing... the music and soundtrack. The film, SG 1 and Atlantis had amazing scores, full orchestras that provided music that even if you didn't pay much attention to it, it never interfered with the scenes, it built up intensity, set the moods for action, or made you feel emotional when it needed to be... yet this SG U show seems to have none of that. Not even a decent title sequence theme. It copies the dumb formula from Grey's Anatomy and inserts some stupid, depressing song, and plays it in it's entirety... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea? And the so called ""creative"" and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises. One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room, never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show, but if this information I've mentioned already doesn't convince you this show sucks, or you can understand why I'm far from being alone on hating this show, then nothing will.",SG-Boo  ( &#865; &#860;&#662; &#865;)&#65279;,1400198400,"05 16, 2014"

"And there's nothing wrong with that, since Jonestown is a singularly disturbing incident in human history and Ti West does horror.  But what exactly is Ti West trying to communicate or do in this movie by (very skillfully) re enacting the events of Jonestown, except take an already horrific event and exploit it to make a movie with barely any fictitious elements in it at all?In short, the move is thus: a brother is concerned about his sister who is drowning in a cult.  That cult is a dead ringer for Jim Jones' cult. If you've ever read anything about the Reverend Jim Jones, the fictitious town of ""Eden"" is precisely the same as the Peoples Temple.  He brings his two buddies and, incidentally, a camera.  This is a disturbing movie but I see very little point to it at all.The reason I give it three stars is for Gene Jones'!

"A game British cast and co writer of Sacha Baron Cohen movies in the director&#8217;s chair, led to this movie described as a &#8216;reverse rom com&#8217; by some.  It&#8217;s laudable to attempt a spin on the worn out premises rolled out time and time again in Hollywood rom coms, and the cast seem well suited to their roles.  We have the central couple who we see at the start embarking on their marriage, their bitter and unhappily married friends, a best friend   best man who reaches new heights of inappropriateness and lack of social graces, and an ex girlfriend of the groom.  As the movie rumbles on, with some blackly comic moments which may bring a guilty smile to your face, we are gradually introduced to the idea that this couples marriage is keeping them from the romances they really should be in.  As the conclusion becomes more inevitable, sadly, blackly inventive comedy becomes just irritatingly condescending and insulting. Counselling is portrayed as a ridiculous waste of time,  and the lies the couple tell each other are poked fun at.  Perhaps the worst indictment of a romantic comedy is that none of the leads are particularly likeable.  It&#8217;s really hard to care about whether they find their true love as depicted in the movie, and if anything we the audience have more investment in the marriage, flawed as it is, which leaves a sense of disappointment that they need to take the easy way out for the movie to reach its pat resolution.  And therein lies the insult.  The idea of a couple fighting to save their marriage is seen as futile, insulting all those who have succeeded in getting over their difficulties and finding happiness together, and the idea of a divorce is seen as a romantic light throwaway moment, insulting all those who have experienced directly or indirectly a divorce.  So yes, there are humourous moments, and Minnie Driver&#8217;s scabrous friend whose answers during charades give away everything but the answers is a highlight, but the humour always feels at a cost, and ultimately the movie does nothing to make you feel good and ultimately the laughs are hollow.Of course, there is always an audience for a movie.  For this movie, if you have a cynical streak about romance, believe that divorce is a worthy goal and that marriage is a singularly failed institution that kills true love, then this IS the movie for you.

"""Lovelace"" is an extreme waste of some talented people.  Amanda Seyfreid plays the lead of a movie supposedly based on the book ""Ordeal"" written by now infamous porn starlet Linda Lovelace.  Ms. Lovelace's claim to fame was her ability to perform a certain sexual act that most people (apparently) did not know existed.  The trouble with the movie is there's just nothing to it:  just several scenes strung together by the flimsiest notion.  No character is given a chance to appear human.  I guess Seyfreid does a so so job of portraying Linda Lovelace.  Lovelace (who is now deceased from injuries suffered in a car accident) has been out of the spotlight for about 40 years, so unless you are familiar with the back story here, you might be left scratching your head in puzzlement.The movie would have you believe that Lovelace  like so many other girls who ""fall"" into the porn industry  was misled by her mean old boyfriend, who exploited her every chance he got, sexually and mentally abused her, and she was this complete victim.  Welllll....if you do a little research on Ms. Lovelace, you'll find she was not all that innocent, and that only confuses this more for the viewer of this film.  She supposedly did a few ""loop"" films (16mm porn films), and she was involved in beastiality in one of those.  The cameraman on that film was interviewed and stated she ""was a very willing participant"" when she made that film.  I also remember her interview with ""Playboy"" wherein she talked openly about what kind of sex she preferred and in what order.""Lovelace"" tries at break neck speed to cover all the bases about her life:  how she got started, how she met her boyfriend who got her started, how she SUPPOSEDLY only made the one porn film, i.e. Deep Throat, how she abused drugs, etc., but the film only manages to scratch the surface on EVERY subplot.  Seyfreid's supporting cast includes Chris Noth, Sharon Stone (in one of the WORST fright wigs I've ever seen), and Robert Patrick.I don't know exactly what the director was going for here, but whatever it was, he certainly missed the mark.

"Horton Foote (1916   2009) ) was an American playwright and screenwriter, perhaps best known for his Academy Award winning screenplays for the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird and the 1983 film Tender Mercies, and his notable live television dramas during the Golden Age of Television. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1995 for his play The Young Man From Atlanta. His last original screenplay as MAIN STREET: it is fortunate that he didn't live to see it produced.  MAIN STREET seems to have something to say   that the economic crisis has devastated small towns to the point of making questionable decisions out of desperation about improving their near ghost town status; that lessons from around the world (Chernobyl and Fukushima, etc) about toxic waste too often go unheeded; that flight of youth from small towns merely to seek change is not always emotionally convincing a decision: that family history and the accoutrements of same don't necessarily guarantee survival for descendants. And out of these plausible concerns could come a decent story, but here the result is flatline. In his film debut as a director John Doyle (known for fine productions of the operas Peter Grimes, The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, and the musical comedy Company) he fails to show a grasp of the use of film to tell a story and we are left with a stew of separate ingredients that seem almost immiscible.Durham, North Carolina is the setting   a town shrinking by the year because of lack of jobs and crumbling businesses   and the major (Isiah Whitlock Jr.) is desperate, deciding whether to schedule or move or cancel the annual parade from Thanksgiving to Christmas due to the town's lack of interest and depression.  Enter Gus Leroy (Colin Firth) who has rented a defunct tobacco warehouse from a town widow Georgiana Carr (Ellen Burstyn) to store canisters of Hazardous Waste awaiting transport to Vernon, Texas for burying: Leroy's apparent Ecology informed company offers the Durham city council the opportunity for economic resurrection.  Georgiana has misgivings about the rental and is faced with the fact that her trust fund form her wealthy father is depleted and she must consider selling the mansion in which she has lived since her birth.  She seeks advice form her niece Willa (Patricia Clarkson) who at first objects but on meeting Leroy falls for the man and the project.  As a sidebar another family faces changes: young Mary Saunders (Amber Tamblyn) is under the spell of her boss (Andrew McCarthy) but still loves her high school sweetheart Harris (Orlando Bloom), a young cop who is studying law at night and living with his depressed mother (Margo Martindale), urging Harris to 'go steady' with Mary and forget law school to stay in Durham.  The human factor enters: there is an accident of one truck hauling canisters (and event that changes the outlook of the wannabe entrepreneur Leroy), Mary's boss is married, and the concept of 'progress' in the decaying town of Durham changes along with the changes in the folk involved in the story.Aside from failing to involve the audience in the story or the characters, the conundrum is why would such a stellar cast of brilliant actors (Colin Firth, Patricia Clarkson, Ellen Burstyn, Orlando Bloom) sign on for such an obvious box office disaster (it is yet to be released)?  One can only jazzume that it was an homage to the memory of the brilliant writer Horton Foote.  It is a shame this screenplay is the last note of the legacy he left us.

"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if  death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended?

"&#34;If you can make it through the first year of marriage you can make it through anything.&#34; Nat (Byrne) and Josh (Spall) have known each other for 7 months when they decide to get married. What starts off happy and exciting quickly turns into something neither of them are sure it will last. When Josh's ex comes back into the picture and Nat's client arrives their relationship is tested to the breaking point with neither Nat or Josh wanting to give up. Judging by the preview I was expecting a laugh out loud comedy and I was looking forward to this. Stephen Merchant and Minnie Driver are really the best and funniest parts of this movie. Their dialog and timing are great. As for the main characters and main story line I found myself more disgusted then I found myself laughing. Nat and Josh really aren't likable and as far as Guy went I really hated him. This movie is nothing more then two married people bordering on cheating on each other with people who are willing even though all parties involved know the situation. If you have seen the movie Closer then you have seen a better version of this. There were funny parts in this but really the movie just made me more upset then anything. Overall, Stephen Merchant and Minnie Driver are great, the rest of the movie not so much. I give it a C+.",Stephen Merchant & Minnie Driver are great.

"This movie is a failure on so many levels.  Let's tackle the mundane first: It is boring, slow, and barely has a plot.  It milks the kid's sickness like a farmer on meth  to the point of mind numbing nausea.  Melodrama anyone?The acting is terrible.  You may ask, &#34;Really? Even Kinnear?&#34;  Yes.  You know why?  Because these actors know that they are participating in a fraud, a money making venture that is exploiting an attention starved child to support his overzealous Christian parents.Jesus rides a rainbow horse.  Everybody has wings in Heaven.  The Holy Spirit basically looks like BooBerry.  Come on, now.If you think the movie is full of nonsense, read the book.  It will blow your mind that anyone gets away with this.  Really.  Colton's dad is going to fight in the end time.  It's going to be just as Revelation claims!  Literally.  Monsters and all.This movie is really about the father and, to a lesser extent, the mother.  Two poor Christians looking to make a spectacle of their child in order to bring in the cash flow.  The movie is less obvious than the book, but their true selves shine through.  This is not about a child's trip to Heaven.  It is about a father's manufacturing of an experience to excite complacent or bored Christians into coming to church and tithing like ATM's with food poisoning.No?  Look up how long it took for this &#34;experience&#34; to be revealed reported to the world.  About as long as it takes to write a novel or two.Disgusting and heart wrenching.  This child only wants to be loved and recognized and accepted as he is.  Yet he needs to jump through hoops and participate in an unconscionable fiction to gain his parents' attention.  This movie is an excellent eye opener for the religious.  Stay home with your children more days than you go to church.  Maybe those prayer meetings can be skipped to show love to your child.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Certainly do not PAY for this tripe.","Heaven is Real, But This Movie is Hell",1405987200,"07 22, 2014"

"Child's Play (Sidney Lumet, 1972)It is exactly thirty eight minutes into Child's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy, slow moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film. The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys' school where the entire film is set. Robert Preston (The Music Man), who plays Joe Dobbs, the headmaster of the eleventh grade cljazz, an English teacher much beloved of the school's pupils, is standing at the front of the chapel, facing the altar. In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley (A Touch of Larceny's James Mason), the headmaster of the senior cljazz, who teaches Greek and Latin and, as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools, still has the nickname ""Lash"". Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film, at least the bits that haven't already been set up. And I can almost imagine Lumet, at the end of that scene, smacking his fist into his other palm, pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges, the other main actor in this movie, then pointing to Preston and yelling, ""THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots!""He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot: We open with Paul Reis (Bridges) as a senior at the school, on his way to see the headmaster, Father Mozian (They Might Be Giants' Ron Weyand), for the very, very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley's chalkboard. He's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs, who cautions young Reis that, while such actions may be amusing, they're not likely to get him anywhere in life. The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis' head  it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls ""one of the nameless rabble of victims"" in A Christmas Story. Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives. Fast forward nine years. Reis is now a phys.ed. teacher who's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there. He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off, as great friends. Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley, but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother's imminent death, which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous, harrjazzing phone calls, and jazzaults on his own character (which include, but are not limited to, pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home, as well as notes being pjazzed by the students  it is never explicitly stated, but made obvious nonetheless, that all of this is homosexual in nature). We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year, but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job, but in fact an agent of Satan himself (he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines, notes, calls, etc.). Reis walks into the middle of this, and while he's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side, his unexpected, and unlikely, ally Father Penny (King of the Gypsies' David Rounds in his first feature appearance), the oft tipsy religion teacher, warns Reis that it's going to happen eventually, no matter how neutral he tries to stay. While this is the main conflict, there's also the ever present bullying that, as we know, Reis is all too familiar with...but this cljazz aren't just bullies, they're sadists; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness, by the time he manages to pull the children off, their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye. A second victim is mock crucified, at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits  which would, almost immediately, cause the school to shut down, as they comprise half the senior cljazz (and thus, half the senior cljazz' tuition). Assuming, of course, the authorities don't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here, and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm (which, admittedly, takes thirty eight minutes). Mason, Preston, and Bridges, of course, were all known commodities by this time, and was there ever any question they were up to the material? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings on at a boys' school, a generic slice of life drama, this would have been a darned good movie. But the final twenty minutes, which turn it into something very different indeed, take it from ""good"" to ""blow the lid off."" In the hands of a lesser director, or performed by lesser actors (and to be fair, there's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line), this could have come off cheesy, if not unintentionally hilarious. But it is meant to be horrific, and it succeeds. This is tragedy of Greek proportions, with the school's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans, and had the first thirty eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour, this would be Lumet's second five star film in my library (Dog Day Afternoon is the other). Even with that considered, this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet; the brilliance of the last sixty two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused, muzzy quality of the first thirty eight. **** ",Lumet's neglected masterpiece,1364169600,"03 25, 2013"

"I'm usually down for a good film based documentary, so I decided to give this one a try as it looked like such an interested concept.  While it was indeed a very intriguing subject, one has to truly be a hard core film buff (the technical stuff) to really get into it.The topic of ""digital film"" vs ""celluloid film"" truly is a fascinating one and deserves a documentary like this.  Whenever a medium change is about to define any industry, it is always a turning point filled with pros and cons that must be discussed in order to obtain some sort of understanding.  That concept is the high point of ""Side by Side"".Sadly, I wish they would have made this doc a bit more ""user friendly"" to those (like me) who wanted to see the comparison ""in action"".  There is far too much ""talking"" and far too little actually comparison of the two film methods.  Clearly, this was a doc made for not just film buffs, but more towards camera buffs who really get into the technical stuff.The choice of Keanu Reeves as narrator host is also a terrible one, as his dry, bland story lends nothing towards the excitement factor.Thus, ""Side by Side"" will be a great little doc for those internally fascinated by film.

"By now, it should be safe to jazzume that the majority of us have either seen or at least heard about the new space thriller, Gravity.  Arguably one of the best films of 2013, it's safe to jazzume that (in the not so distant future) there will be a steady flow of space dramas coming our way in a cheap attempt to cash in on the mjazzive success of Gravity.  Naturally, it's no coincidence that the independent space drama, Europa Report, was released on home video just days after the release of the Bullock Clooney blockbuster.Directed by Sebasti&aacute;n Cordero (Rage, Chronicles), Europa Report stars Embeth Davidtz as Dr. Unger, the head of a corporation that privately funds an outer space mission, Europa One, to investigate potential life on one of the moons of Jupiter.  In a documentary style format and using various camera footage shot aboard the space shuttle, Unger tells the story of six astronauts that successfully land on one of Jupiter's moon and attempt to research the surface, which is made partially of ice   a sign that the moon may inhabit life forms.  Anamaria Marinca, Karolina Wydra, Michael Nyqvist, Daniel Wu, Sharlto Copley, & Christian Camargo also star in supporting roles.Since Europa Report was conveniently released (on home video) on the coattails of Gravity, it warrants a quick comparison to the buzz worthy blockbuster.  If we use the opinion of James Cameron, who called Gravity ""the best space film ever done,"" Europa Report could easily be called the worst space film ever done.  Much like the great unknown of outer space, these types of films obviously thrive on the simple premise that anything that could wrong will go wrong.  Feel free to look for an outer space flick in which everything is all hunky dory for its entirety   and in the event that such a film did exist, it would most likely be the equivalent of watching paint dry.  In any event, while Gravity thrived largely due to beautiful visuals, above average thrills, A list actors, and an easily understandable plot, Europa Report nearly fails in comparison in each and every category.It's painfully evident that Europa Report lacks a clear and comprehensible direction in regards to who the characters are and what their particular purpose is over the course of this film.  Obviously, Daniel Wu portrays the captain, but at no point does he ever appear to be in command of anything.  These actors and actresses are completely devoid of emotion, dimension, and for lack of a better word   interest.  If the point of this film was to be a documentary style flick in which viewers were not supposed to care about the characters within it, then it was a smashing success.  But, as far as the entertainment value of the character development, this film is absent of potential.  These characters, portrayed by completely unrecognizable actors and actresses, simply go through the motions of the script, which is nearly a full hour and a half of bumbling around a space shuttle.The most bothersome aspect of the film is the constant jumping from bad camera view to bad camera view.  Unfortunately, this style of film making deprives the film of a smooth delivery, directly stemming from the space cams, which take away the experience of watching a movie and turn this film into an outer space version of big brother.  One minute you'll be watching the crew eat dinner and then you'll suddenly be viewing a swing arm and solar panels in outer space   as if they will eventually come into meaning (which they don't).  In a noble act, this film sticks with the documentary style of storytelling, but just when scenes attempt to pick up, they are quickly broken up by random analysis from spectators (presumably on Earth) who attempt to explain the fallout and existential circumstances of the Europa One mission.  When you combine aspects, they make for a frustrating viewing experience.While the film's execution is overly frustrating, the story is still on the money in terms of how humanity might one day approach space exploration.  To be honest, there's nothing sexy about this film and is a far cry from some of the sci fi flicks moviegoers have been spoiled with in recent years, like Prometheus, Star Trek, or Moon.  Still, the authenticity of Europa Report is admirable   as it clearly aims to depict a film that would dwarf the magnitude of the moon landing.  The significance of this story is there, but the emotion is years beyond comprehension, because when if the day comes that life is discovered on another planet, people might just look back on this film and make a distinct comparison.Overall, Europa Report is a dismal and disappointing movie to sit through.  Realistically, all you need to know about this film is that six astronauts land on a moon orbiting Jupiter and then fast forward to the last twenty minutes   where you'll finally ""see the light.""  You'll miss absolutely nothing of relevance, regardless of what happens to the characters along the way.  The climax of this film is it's only saving grace, thus preventing it from earning a complete failing grade.  For a film that's supposed to be thrilling, one could only jazzume that the most thrilling portions of this film were left on the cutting room floor.  Any other explanation would lead you to believe that the writers and filmmakers suffer from sheer incompetence when it comes to making an entertaining film.  Do yourself a favor and don't even bother giving this film a chance.  The brief 90 minutes of your life which it would cost you to watch this film (along with money presumably) will surely be better spent doing absolutely anything else.GRADE:  D FNDNreview.com",'Europa Report' struggles to find life,1381276800,"10 9, 2013"

"Excuse the cheesy line, but I'm Not Jesus Mommy isn't a good film. The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she's not capable of having children. The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation, 9 months after that, then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost. The story really doesn't bother explaining much. It's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible. Kimberly, the mother character, has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful to watch performance, she has some potential though. Also, if you watched the teasers trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen, but it really has only a few similarities.However, I did enjoy the music in the film a lot.

"I encourage the creators (Matt Shumway and Company)  to continue creating Sci Fi movies. This Sci Fi movie had a lot of potential and for an independent film; ""excellent"" set design and good use special effects!However, the ""acting"" delivery of the lines could of been better. It sounded like they were speaking from the script. As an professional actress (who has worked for independent film makers in the San Fran   Bay Area); I can tell by their line delivery.I think there needs to be more rehearsal time and work allowing actors to ""be in the moment"". The quality of the acting could of been a whole lot better. A lot of film makers  directors totally do not get that.The story writing was ""ok"" but not sure if the intention was to ""cheese out"" towards the end. Also the VIP prisoner ""fight scenes"" did not make sense. If she was that dangerous, she would kill, not think, and move toward her next agenda. So those fight scenes felt empty.The story also seemed rushed. Nothing more captivating than, allowing the audience ""to be in the moment"" considering the films set design supported it.Sci Fi if done well is one of the most difficult and rewarding art forms an film artist can accomplish. Like Horror; it is also one of the most difficult genres to be successful in.Sci Fi is one of the most highly desired genres that people seek to watch and if you have the set design then take advantage of the ""environment"" that you have created. Sci Fi is about tomorrow and the unknown. Its not about being scary; it about humanity and non humanity in the future.This movie didn't give us any of that. It was a rushed story with no background for us to hold on too.If you look at ""high budget"" TV shows like Stargate SG 1. You will notice that this movie (Enigma) had a great ""Sci Fi set design"" to work with (similar to big budget Sci Fi TV shows) and a decent baseline story to work with.Low budget does NOT = rushing the storyline or trying to finish the film in one day.For the next film you guys make: Please allow actors to fully understand the scene and the environment in which they are working in and also....please put more energy into the ""story"" itself.Lots of promise for you guys to hit it big on the SyFy network one day!!",Dear Shumway Brothers:,1403913600,"06 28, 2014"

"Robin Williams is good in this role, and it's not the first time he has balanced a bit of humor with a serious subject.  But, since I can't give it 0 stars, I give it what it deserves, because even though there is a laugh or two, in reality it is a HEAVY drama with tragic story lines.  So don't watch this expecting laughs like I did, and maybe you won't be disappointed.  It is extremely depressing, and if I had watched this while depressed, this movie would have made it much worse.And, by the way, to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie doesn't live up to expectations, I say this:  It is described as a COMEDY.  Not dark humor.  Not black comedy.  Not even ""intelligent humor"" as another reviewer said.  If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing, with ONLY a laugh or two, I wouldn't have been expecting one of Robin Williams' comedies.  I'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama, but I don't like to see a ""comedy"" movie about suicide, accidental or otherwise. (and BTW who knows for SURE it was accidental anyway???)  There is NOTHING funny about suicide. Chances are pretty good that I would have pjazzed it by had I known it was so dark.

"This is a very watchable film and it held my interest throughout.  Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and the rest of the excellent supporting cast are what makes this film go.  This is a financial thriller right out of today's headlines.  Richard Gere is a financial magnate who has made a large and unwise investment that has threatened to take his firm down.  He is groping for a financial lifeline, and therein lies this interesting story.  This is a thinking person's film, but it tells the story very well.The problem with the film in my opinion is the unsympathetic nature of most of the characters.  Gere comes across as an unlikable hypocrite and his wife is no better.  The rest of the characters are swept up in Gere's amoral and immoral schemes, and somehow mostly come across as unsympathetic saps.  Well, that was my take on it; yours may be different.

"something happened circa 09 11 01. This show kinda soured. I used to think this show was hilarious. And since 9 11 the episodes were bad. Not even funny. It was kinda nostalgic to see this in 2012, which is why I give it 3 stars  when it should have gotten 2. And for that I think it is worth seeing by anyone who used to enjoy them. But the story was not really funny and they are all just old. Even Bubbles looks like an old woman trying to play a young woman  clownish or even a parody of her character. Kinda sad I think. But the grandmother looks well and her age. She doesn't seem to age much I don't think. Anyway how many story lines can they make about drugs? I never thought that was funny in this show or any movie for that matter. I guess there are people who do . . . from the laughter I hear sometimes in the movie theatre.  But because they obviously are limited at this point in what they can come up with they just made this entire episode about drugs. It kinda in a strange way reminds me of Lucille Ball and I Love Lucy. She should have just stopped after I Love Lucy.

"One good thing about the anthology horror &#8220;V H S 2&#8221; is that the sequel is much shorter than the original. The &#8220;frame story&#8221; gets tighter and more coherent. The main section has more variety in the subject matters and approaches than that of the first one.&#8220;V H S 2&#8221; has a similar opening to its predecessor, with a private investigator and his girlfriend looking for clues to a missing college student. What they stumbled upon in the student&#8217;s room is, of course, TV sets and VHS tapes.The introductory part is followed by four segments, each covering such topics as &#8220;ghosts&#8221; &#8220;zombies&#8221; &#8220;cult rituals&#8221; and &#8220;aliens,&#8221; with the &#8220;frame story&#8221; serving as a sort of interlude. The &#8220;zombies&#8221; part is more like a low key comedy with a POV camera attached to a zombie. Probably the most impressive (and shocking) one would be the third segment about a documentary crew investigating a mysterious cult leader. All I can say is it is VERY gory.As far as storytelling goes, the second installment is an improvement on the first one.

"""A Little Bit Zombie"" is what happens when fans of a movie make a movie.  Look, we all love ""Evil Dead""   or to be precise, we all really love ""Evil Dead II"" because anyone who watches the first installment and expects the hilarious humor of the sequel is in for the shock of their lives   but there's a fine line between an homage and a lame copy.  Unfortunately ""A Little Bit Zombie"" is a little bit in the latter category.The plot, such as it is, centers on HR manager Steve (Kristopher Turner) who is marrying salon stylist and high maintenance fianc&eacute;e Tina (Crystal Lowe).  There's just one problem: Steve's sister and maid of honor Sarah (Kristen Hager) hates Tina, and it's easy to see why.  Fortunately, Steve's best friend Craig (Shawn Roberts) is also Sarah's husband and is there to provide moral support. Things take a turn for the hilarious when Steve is bitten by a zombie mosquito and slowly begins to turn into a cannibalistic brain eater.  Hunted by a magic orb wielding hottie Penelope (Emilie Ullerup) and crotchety shotgun wielding Max (Stephen McHattie), it seems our fun foursome are about to experience a very bad weekend in the woods.The cast is a problem. Turner is pjazzable as a normal guy just trying doing his best to avoid nibbling on his friends' brains, but Lowe is pretty bad in a role that requires her to carry much of the humor.  Her inability to keep up with Hager of ""Being Human"" fame is apparent   the roles could easily have been reversed, as there's more chemistry between Hager and Turner than there is between Turner and Lowe.  Ew.The zombie hunters aren't much better. McHattie plays Max as a psychopath who will blow anything up at a moment's notice, which is probably supposed to be funnier than it is.  For a great example of McHattie's talent put to good use against zombies, see ""Pontypool."" Blonde bombshell Ullerup speaks her lines with her usual wide eyed wooden acting   if you've seen her turn as Ashley Magnus in ""Sanctuary,"" you know what to expect here.Fortunately, ""A Little Bit Zombie"" doesn't take itself too seriously.  Yes, the homages to ""Evil Dead"" are over the top, from the shed scene to the chuckle worthy evil point of view cam, but the film's heart is in the right place even if it the script doesn't hit most of the comedy beats. The ending is appropriately off key and at least ironic enough to make it worth sticking with the film.""A Little Bit Zombie"" isn't very gory, isn't very funny, and isn't very good   but then it isn't trying to be.  It's just a little bit of all three that makes it a pjazzable entry in the zombie humor genre.",Like 'Evil Dead' only not as awesome,1362268800,"03 3, 2013"

"I didn't really have high hopes for this apparent Paranormal Activity wannabe since I'm not a fan of camcorder style horror flicks to begin with, but this didn't even live up to my already low expectations.  The first actor you see onscreen when the movie starts is Rick Gonzalez, who was a regular on the television series Reaper.  I've never seen one of these movies with a recognizable actor before because that ruins the illusion that what you are seeing is real, which is the main point of the camcorder style format.  But Apartment 143 turns out to be more like a bad episode of Sea of Souls than a Paranormal Activity knock off, and the camcorder format is basically a misguided and unnecessary gimmick.  The basic premise of the movie is that a team of researchers sets up shop inside an apartment where a family (father, teen age daughter, young son) are experiencing what appears to be a haunting.  There are phone calls with nobody there and ringing doorbells with nobody at the door and strange noises but even in real life this stuff would be more annoying than scary.  Nothing remotely scary happens in the movie until nearly an hour in.  The biggest problem with Apartment 143, though, is that it has a very lousy script.  The researchers are supposed to be experts in paranormal activity but the idea that a poltergeist might be the issue isn't brought up until nearly two thirds of the way into the movie  but given the presence of an angry teenage daughter in the home that should have been one of the first things that occurred to all three researchers.  Then in an amazingly laughable scene the head researcher suggests that the teen daughter might be suffering from the onset of schizophrenia  because nothing says schizophrenia like furniture flying of it's own accord across the room and characters levitating Exorcist style on their own.  Ugh.  There are a couple of decent shocks involving the daughter but otherwise this movie is a talky and poorly written bore.

"Season one of Boston Legal was dazzling. The writing was clever, witty, and intelligent. And Alan Shore as the maverick lawyer was as memorable a character as I have ever seen on a TV show.  Then, something happened.  The insightful social and political commentaries became heavy handed, and by season five they were nearly incomprehensible.  (In ""Roe"" Shirley Schmidt accuses China of a ""Holocaust"" against women. Last time I checked, women, even Chinese women, were in no danger of extinction.) But the worst decision the producers made was to give ""Hands"" Espenson center stage.

"You may like it or just hate it. Whatever your reaction to ""Take This Waltz"" may be, you will admit one thing: three time Oscar nominee Michelle Williams's great acting skills. It seems she has been doing ""serious"" movies these days   remember she was in a comedy ""Dick""?   and ""Take This Waltz"" is no exception, a romantic story with serious themes including boredom in marriage and life. That's fine with me, but as to Sarah Polley's sophomore effort as director, I think something is not right with the film. Or, in short, I was not convinced.Michelle Williams is Margot, a happily married woman writing for travel brochures. Her husband is Lou (Seth Rogen) writing a book about chicken recipes. While travelling abroad, Margot meets Daniel (Luke Kirby), an aspiring young artist, who happens to be living across the street. Now you know the rest of the story.Michelle Williams's emotional acting, in itself impeccable, is somewhat at odds with Sarah Polley's direction that tends to be too smart. Some of the dialogues and scenes are self conscious of their importance, attempting so hard to serve as a metaphor or a clue as to what is going on in and around the characters, such as Margot's remarks about being ""afraid of plane connections"" or Daniel's muscular body when driving a rickshaw. In one scene the camera keeps going around two characters in a room, symbolizing the lapse of time (and perhaps their inability to move on). Some people would find these things thoughtful and intelligent. I think they are just pretentious.I see the point the director is trying to make, but in spite of (or perhaps because of) the stunning performances from Michelle Williams (the opening sequence alone is enough to prove her talent), the film looks artificial and unnatural. The film is often very emotional, to be sure, but the emotions come from her superb acting.Some films are called a ""character study."" ""Take This Waltz"" is a study of emotion, and as such it is fascinating, perfectly capturing various phases of love.

"To go along with all this cheesy acting.I didn't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end. I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt. It goes from ""Okay,to Interesting, to Good, to Terrible, to Great, to Completely Awful"" and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series. The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show. Sometimes there's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop. It's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors. Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you didn't waste your time to watch it all. Then complied into that is the acting, and how bad it is. There are maybe but a handful of ""good"" actors on this show and they are all Villians. With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines. It's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show. The acting is completely all over the place.For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2. Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show. I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon. Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he's just running around town nagging people with the same ""I want to help"", ""your a story book character"" it just gets old and quick. Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner! and I know ""he's just a kid"" yeah and a terrible actor. I wouldn't cared much or have said much if they didn't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show. No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it's ruined. I don't even understand this kids story. So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch. She's nicer than 99.9% of the mothers out there.Unlike his real mother she didn't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother. I mean think about it she feeds him well, buys him toys to play with, drives him to school, takes him out eat, I mean what the heck. She's a great mother but this kid can't stop complaining about her. For what? Pampering and spoiling him? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic. If this show stuck to the point and didn't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching. Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.and by all means do bring the thumbs down. Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is.

"Putting aside that this was another film with unlikeable characters doing dumb things in an unexplained end of humanity non plot, I was still hoping the Blu would have some stellar extras and picture quality (with all of the darks and shadows). Unfortunately, the special features are some of the worst inclusions I have seen on a film like this, and the only thing giving this some higher marks was the 7.1 DTS.The story follows four people wallowing through their idiocies in trying to survive some unknown catastrophe that leaves a city (played by Detroit   which was a better character than everyone here) devoid of people. Some bad CGI shadows follow them around trying to gobble them up sans their clothing. I would have to say some typecasting has to occur here when you have Hayden Christiansen walking around with a hood barely showing his face for several sequences, followed by someone holding a long green glow stick baring resemblance to a certain weapon Hayden might be carrying in some other franchise. But anyway, the supplements are all in lodef and I listed all of the bad ones first:* Alternate endings, 3 or 4 at 8:20 minutes. Please take my advice and skip these. They are no different except for one alternate camera angle and a different sunset   nothing changes from the film.* Revealing 7th Street (making of), 7:04 minutes. Talking heads & really bad insight by the cast on the film and story.* Creating the Mood of 7th, 7:04 minutes. They essentially took the cuts from the first one and made this longer one, but with reasons for why they chose Detroit. Which I have to say I am not sure if all of the reasoning made Detroit seem worse (""gothic"", ""Dead"" etc.), or they just didn't realize they were saying it.* Behind the scenes montage, 2:11 minutes. Several identical cuts from the other two quips, with no dialogue. Would be best as a workbook for the staff of the film, otherwise a complete skipper.* HDNet Promo, 4:19 minutes (In HD). The standard trailer length plug.* Fangoria Interviews, 2 @ 31 minutes. This was actually an insightful and thorough interview process and was better than the commentary. Thankfully, Brad takes up 22 minutes of the set and will be worth the watch for his fans. Jacob's lasts only a few minutes and the rest is clips of the film.* Dig Copy, not disc dependent.* Commentary, see Fangoria interview instead.I was not impressed with the film, the bad effects that shined through on BD, or the ending being given away on the cover art (so no surprise for me, that ending sucked anyway) but I was impressed with the 7.1   maybe only getting used by the creature sounds at various times, but a nice immersion. English and Spanish subs, region A coded. Not worthy of a purchase but maybe a renter for the Hayden fans. 1.5 stars for the film, and 1.5 for the sound and Fangoria set.",Overall disappointing film & BD production,1305244800,"05 13, 2011"

"I watched ""Burn Notice: The Fall of Sam Axe"" with a fair amount of expectation and anticipation. I have watched the ""Burn Notice"" series from its inception with my spouse and I think that it's fair to say that it is one of our favorite weekly programs. Add to that, I have been a tireless devotee to the brilliant Bruce Campbell for more years than I care to recognize in print (decades!). So, this made for TV movie seemed like a can't miss proposition. And, indeed, it begins on a decidedly whimsical note as Campbell faces a military tribunal for an escapade gone wrong. With his trademark bluster, Campbell challenges authority like no one else! His character has become a fan favorite over the years due to his verbal interplay with his series's co stars Gabrielle Anwar and, most notably, Jeffrey Donovan. Donovan directs this tepid prequel and puts in a cameo, but its just long enough to highlight what's missing from this incarnation of the Burn Notice saga.As much as I liked the comedic stylings of the present day military sequences, one would expect a terrific, funny and larger than life episode to showcase Sam's outrageousness. In fact, the jungle exploits between a corrupt military junta and a ragtag band of rebel fighters just seems far too easy and conventional. In a set up used in countless other films, Sam is sent as an observer to a third world nationality and discovers that all is not as it seems in their plight with rebel forces. Soon Sam is in the thick of things protecting an altruistic hospital (sweet) and its strong and dedicated American Canadian doctors (no language barriers here!). But it is a sjazzy rebel orphan who really seals the deal in this film. Painfully unreal and contrived, the girl exists to personalize the story  but is just one more example of a character construct as opposed to a real person. That's right, the great Campbell's principle foil is a precocious teen  uggh!The strength of Burn Notice, as I mentioned above, is in its verbal pyrotechnics. The characters play off one another with rapid fire dexterity, and Campbell is an integral part of that success. Here, the script lacks the savvy and the smarts necessary to make this must see entertainment and Campbell's big persona fails to have a match in the likable, if forgettable, ensemble of the film. Another part of the series' charm comes from stylish adventure and a palpable sense of danger. Here, the action is straightforward and lacking the visual flair we'd expect from the show. And as for danger, there's never a doubt as to the outcome of this fairly generic tale. As a Campbell enthusiast, I prefer his campier film forays and as a Burn Notice fan  this only hinted at the elements which distinguish the show. I watched it, it was pleasnat enough, but I can't imagine a second viewing. If you don't watch Burn Notice, though  you're missing out. I suggest you start there!

It is very alluring and would make his character Dracula more alluring in the process.  Maybe if he develops a relationship with Mina, he can show his true accent come out with her.  It would give the audience a break from boring American accent he is using.  I like the actor for Dracula, but I do not like the slicked back hair style.

"Although I watch the first episode with a huge grain of salt (the topic seemed a bit of a clich&eacute; for the sci fi person), I was immediately caught by the acting, the nuances, flaws, and chemistry of the characters in themselves and interacting with each other. Dorian, the humanoid cop, is fantastic, surprising, and emotionally compelling. His human pal, detective John Kennex, plays well the conflicted, not too good at communicating detective, who is more sensitive, good hearted, and compjazzionate than his thick skinned, damaged cop surface shows. The two of them working together are a pleasure to watch. So are the characters around, all rich and intriguing. Lily Taylor as Captain Maldonado is just royal. Detective Stahl is more than eye candy, and the in house robotics expert played by Mackenzie Crook, is fun. The tough to annoying cop Det Paul, is right on the note as well.The big problem is that while casting and acting are top notch, the writing seems often an afterthought. The fascinating world in which the live is hardly delved with. The terrorist group that has costed Det Kennex his leg, his men, and a broken heart, are not a thing that one can pin down during season 1. The crazy criminals and crimes they pursue are always too superficially addressed. No topic grows or is a thing except the friendship between Dorian and his human colleague. The central topic    what  is to be human?    is hardly addressed by anything else than Dorian's moving reactions to some crimes and use of androids by humans. The chances offered by potential conversations between him and others androids (Danika in the finale for instance) are cut by action scenes that often seem too long. The pischo who killed people to get more views for his game was just one more villain to get obsessed with John, as if there were not other humans in the city. The writing is so superficial, inane, and clich&eacute; that you can often write the plot of the entire episode after two or three scenes. A shame. The show has great potential.

"It's amazing to see how many people recommended this movie and give it a five star vote. Maybe it's because I went into it after reading reviewers comments and they hyped the movie up more then it was, but I went in expecting something mind blowing, and all I found was disappointment in what I would hardly call anything more then a science fiction movie re inventing what you think about Trolls. It's definitely not a horror movie, nor a thriller.. it's not scary, unless you are a complete wuss that is afraid of your own shadow, and the re invention of Trolls as large monsters that the Norwegian Government don't want people to know about is just plain silly.::Plot::3 College kids are out and about looking for something to film, as they haven't got much else better to do. They find a town where there is a dead bear that has supposedly been shot, but some of the people they interview beleive it was not shot, as no one has laid claim to the kill, and tracks around the bear look suspicious. The trio end up following a man who they think may be a suspect to the bear shooting. They follow him into the woods and end up running away from a strange sound caused by something big that is chasing them. They team up with the man who they where following, who just happens to be the #1 and only Troll hunter in Norway who explains to them that he doesn't mind them filming what he does, as long as they do exactly what he says. He also explains that the government know about the trolls and that he is paid to hunt them down if they go outside their territories nearer to human populated areas. He also explains that he doesn't care if they film this secret, because the government pays him very little, which I found hard to swallow, but OK. The Norway leaders only need one guy to hunt these things... sure. Okie Dokey then. Anyway...The 4 of them go on a hunt of trolls, learn how trolls are tracked, their species, and how to get a blood sample of one for a veterinarian.::End Plot::With everyone saying this is a must see movie, and how scary it is, It makes me wonder what other movies those people have been exposed to so far? Because this movie, it's not all as great as it's being hyped up to be. It's kind of like Blair Witch style but they are on the hunt of large mammals that either explode or turn to stone when they are exposed to ultraviolet UV rays.Sure they CGI is not bad, but that does not make a movie brilliant. I was drifting in and out of consciousness by the end of the movie. I dunno, maybe I prefer my scary movies to make sense or have a more interesting plot going on, but I didn't find this movie as gripping or compelling as some others have been saying it is.

"This is a very strange movie. It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget, the characters are ultra quirky marginals, and there's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not, and what is really wrong with the 'woman', why can't she be in love? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film. And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century. Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director, writer, and lead female is Marianna Palka. Jason Ritter (John Ritter's son) is the lead male actor. The film meanders back and forth between Marianna's apartment, the video store where Jason works, and Jason's car where he lives. In the opening montage, Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section. She quickly chooses four movies. Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one, and she should not take that movie. He leaves off renting her the fourth movie, she leaves with the three films. Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic, the apartment is small, Jason over stays his welcome, the two end up just too close to eachother, the car where he sleeps is tiny. The only place that is somewhat open is the video store. Both of these characters have strange habits. She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD's, she hates to have her hair washed, she collects trash in her apartment, and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason. Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch, he has a regular job but can't afford a place to live, he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains, and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters. It was as if the director   screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange, like outcasts, outsiders; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood. And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna's distaste for genitals, male and female. The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother, well that was reasonable.Technically, there were some problems. The audio was absolutely awful, the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded. This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters, sadly the dialog was frequently muddy. This was a simple shoot, very few locations or sets; the video store, the car, the apartment complex entrance, and the apartment. The director did not use framing to her advantage at all, Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story; but yet she ends up in random frame positions. There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt. Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming, butted up against a jump cut to a much later time. The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm. One moment the camera is in the apartment, the next in Jason's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers, oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included. A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I've ever heard. This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes, the movie is a bit long. The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard. The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers. Oddly, there is virtually no nudity in the film. Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film; write, direct, star in, and over play a not so bad love story.

"At least that's what they attempted.  But it doesn't really scare and it doesn't really make any sense.  Now, I'm thinking my rating may have been too high.  Is it a government conspiracy?  Is it a love story?  Is it an extra terrestrial takeover? Is it a story about a phobia of toy dogs?  Yeah, it was watchable.  And this could have been a really good movie had the writers taken one of those ideas (maybe not the toy dog phobia) and stuck with it.  Bascially something falls from the sky into a storage center.  Conviently, the people at the center are locked into it because of a malfunctioning chain link gate.  And now the story gets falls off the rails.  Starting with the silly woman walking her dog who decides to investigate the fallen metal container.  Men in Black in cars suddenly show up, only to never be seen again.  Oh, nothing happens to them, the writers decided not to use them anymore.  So we're introduced to the love broken guy from Dr. Who and his best friend, who he finds out later... well, you'll see.  Throw in an old coot who's squatting in one of the storage pods, a creepy basement, toy dogs and fireworks, air ducts (a la ALIEN), a twist in the love story, and a creature that looks like a cross between the Predator and a dinosaur.  Actually, something you might see in a more intelligent version of Dr Who.  And at the end, you're waiting for the good Doctor to show up to rescue you from whatever is the new plot that the writers have devised.

"I've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book, and even when I could understand the differences between the two, I knew that for the most part, Thor and Loki got along. Unlike the Greek gods, the Norse gods could die, but they never grew old    and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak. So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pjazz on this. True, Loki's actions in regard to Balder's pjazzing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death, as well as Thor's, Odin's and the other gods, but he wasn't the cackling super villain  depicted in these ridiculous cartoons.

"There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review. If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn't follow along with the mjazzes, then don't read this.

You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am. Likely, you will want to pick apart every word of my review. It may be an attempt to mirror how ""harsh"" one person called this review, or how ""brutal"" another dubbed its author. At this point, I don't even care*.

It's either this or the Backyardigans (although I think the latter is better conceived). Pick your poison.*When I say I don't care, I don't mean that I don't think other opinions are valid. I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not so subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don't care about.The review:1) Aang's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko's hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra's story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcjazz. If you don't like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can't learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra's story did not need to follow Aang's exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mjazz transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it's innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, ""necessity is the mother of invention"". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang's science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist's coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire ""Facebook Developers"" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand ""likes"" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don't care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it's the best thing you ever saw, ""like"" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did.

"There is something strangely fascinating about the casting of a downward spiraling Lindsay Lohan as screen icon (and two time Oscar winner) Elizabeth Taylor. Lohan is an easy target, to be sure, so I entered into the Lifetime original movie ""Liz & Dick"" with a reasonably open mind. It's true that this TV movie was lambasted critically, but it also became one of cable's biggest ratings hits of 2012. So, if nothing else, the Lohan factor created a certain curiosity. In that way, Lifetime came out the winner. That said, I might not have expected greatness, depth, or insight out of ""Liz & Dick,"" but I did anticipate a bit of fun. With a history of cheesy and over the top movies, I thought this might be a genuine guilty pleasure. Highlighting the tempestuous relationship between Taylor and Richard Burton (played by Grant Bowler, now on SyFy's Defiance), there was lots of room for campy fun. Alas, this never comes to fruition. Too superficial to be truly enlightening and too serious to be much fun, ""Liz & Dick"" doesn't make much of a mark at all.The movie is centered, for the most part, around the Cleopatra shoot that put Burton and Taylor together for the first time. Not much in the way of introduction is done for either, so hopefully you know something about each career wise to put the story into context. Taylor is a diva, Burton a charming boozer. Both are married, but are somehow drawn to one another. Looking at the movie, however, there is nothing to establish this as a grand pjazzion or a legitimate romance. There is a mild opposites attract flirtation and suddenly they are dissolving their marriages. They get together only because they're supposed to, to heck with demonstrating any real drama or relationship building. This by the numbers biography is so vague and unenlightening, they try to add content by staging interludes where Taylor and Burton reminisce in spare interview sequences.If you are familiar with Burton and Taylor, ""Liz & Dick"" offers absolutely no new insight into the pair. Chances are that if you have a preexisting knowledge of this film era and a love of movies, you are already smarter than the film's screenplay. I feel like this was made as an introduction to those who have zero exposure to the actual back story. But if that's the case, the movie doesn't dig deeply enough into the dynamics of the relationship or provide anything that defines this couple as the Hollywood royalty that they were. As for the performances, the great Theresa Russell is completely wasted as Taylor's mother. Bowler is likable enough, I suppose, but doesn't have much to work with. And Lohan lacks impact as a woman that could captivate the world. Truthfully, though, it is the tepid screenplay that makes ""Liz & Dick"" so dull. As I said, this didn't have to be great but it should have been fun!

"Contracted (Eric England, 2013)While I am relatively certain based on the poster art that the opening paragraph remarks below are not really a spoiler, but I will put this up here just in case. The following could be considered spoilers for the film.Zombies have been used in film and literature for almost a century now as allegories for pretty much everything you can imagine that an author or screenwriter can find wrong with society. Mindless obedience to one's masters? Check. Rampant consumerism? Check. Religious fervor? Check. Sexually transmitted diseases? Check. ...okay, that one's new. Contracted takes that tack, and while it misses a few points and you have to, how shall we say, willfully blind yourself to a few things, it does so in an amusingly gross way that I found somewhat delightful.After an opening scene that was obviously inspired by Nacho Cerd&aacute; (even down to the lighting), we are introduced to Sam (Dawning's Najarra Townsend, much improved here). Sam, formerly a sexually confused heroin addict, has finally gotten her life together. As we open, she is sitting in her car, about to go to a party thrown by her friend Alice (Alice Macdonald in her first feature appearance), and is calling her girlfriend Nikki (Madison County's Katie Stegeman) to find out if she's coming over after work. She gets voicemail, and you can tell from Sam's hesitancy in the message she leaves that all is not right in relationship ville. Nor is it at the party, where in quick succession she runs into Riley (Among Brothers' Matt Mercer), a &#8220;nice guy&#8221; who's kind of dangerously close to stalker territory, often hanging out at the restaurant where Sam and Nikki work; Zain (Rubber's Charley Koontz), her former dealer; and a very, very drunk Alice, who proceeds to talk Sam, who was planning on staying sober, into doing shots. Fast forward to 2AM, Sam is very drunk, and she meets someone else&#8212;BJ (You're Next's Simon Barrett). Not a nice guy; he ends up date raping her. When Sam wakes up the next morning, she jazzumes she has a hangover, but there are a few symptoms that don't feel too hangover like. But man, when the second day rolls around, that's when things really start getting weird...There are two things you should really know before going into this movie that, perhaps, should have been made clearer by the filmmakers. The first is that while the movie is structured as a standard mystery thriller, with Sam's zombification as the Big Reveal, I do not believe for one second that what is happening to Sam was meant to be a surprise. Did you really not get it from looking at the poster? That is a strong indication to me that the journey was more important than the destination here. (Think about the opening scene of American Beauty, where Kevin Spacey's character announces he's dead, as a cognate.) The second, and by far the more important one, is that Contracted is not a horror movie. It is above all a drama, a character study of one former addict whose life is spiraling out of control after a traumatic incident that happens to use zombification rather than alcohol or drug use as its method of depicting Sam's downfall. Because of the zombie aspect, England (Roadside), who also wrote, was able to incorporate black comedy elements into the script as well, and he did a pretty good job with those. Are you serioualy going to tell me you didn't laugh when Sam's boss, George (Larry Crown's E kan Soong), tries to pjazz off her symptoms as pinkeye? The movie has taken loads of flack for the characters being blind to what's going on with Sam. If this were a horror movie, they would be right. In a black comedy, those things make perfect sense.On the other hand, the one criticism I see flung about messageboards regarding this movie I do have to agree with is the stupidity. Not of the other characters&#8212;like I said above, that makes perfect sense if you regard the movie correctly&#8212;but of Sam herself. Her initial dumb decision, to not tell anyone she was date raped, is understandable in present day American culture, where date rape still carries a huge stigma (and even more so in Sam's case, for reasons the viewer discovers towards the end of the film). But the farther on we get and the more radical the stupid decisions Sam makes, the less tenable the movie gets. How far would you be willing to go to conceal the fact that you'd been date raped from your girlfriend? I'm pretty sure Sam crosses every conceivable line by the end of the movie. That's what I meant up top when I said you've got to willfully ignore some stuff about this movie. But if you can, and you are willing to go with the gross out scenes, this is a fun little movie. Worth checking out. ***",Venereal,1399939200,"05 13, 2014"

"Bo is a supernatural, extraordinary girl with psychic powers. The problem is many groups and authorities are after her and each one of them wants to use her for their own devices wither it's evil or good. Now, Winter the closest thing Bo had to a father figure has been trying to protect her from falling in the wrong hands. In order to do so, he frees Tate an ex convict from Prison and asks him to guard Bo and make sure she stays safe.And so they hit the road, except it's really difficult for them to stay unnoticed considering how the police are looking for Tate and they are also looking for Bo. There's a lot of twists and turns into the story and it's only been 4 episodes out so far.Personally, this show isn't all terrible, it has it's decent moments it could be entertaining on a boring school work night. However, the characters are so unlikable it's daunting and the plot isn't all that solid to compensate for that fact. Bo especially is the worse, she's very annoying and I have no idea why she even needs to be protected by anyone. Every single time they get into trouble or Tate gets almost caught by the police she seems very capable of helping herself and everyone around her out of the situation with her magical super powers. She also is extremely obnoxious and a know it all.Tate on the other hand is your typical bad boy image who is everything but ... I think the producers failed on creating that one. He's a criminal so obviously that gives him a sense of danger but he was also wrongfully accused and to be honest he seems so lost in the whole thing. Like he just doesn't know what he wants to do with his life.Winter is also annoying. He spends most of his time protecting Bo and he even quits from his job, isolates himself from his family just to protect Bo from those so called evil organisations that want her in their team. A bit too extreme? don't you think maybe he could've sent her some other country away from all of this instead of having to follow her around till eternity?

"TWO LOVERS is an intimate film that requires that the viewer can identify with or at least care about the characters it depicts.  Otherwise this is a pretty dark film with few moments of light to redeem the rather depressing story.  It is a verismo style contemporary tale of choices made by vulnerable and rather weak people living life in a closed world.Brighton Beach, Brooklyn is the shadowing decaying setting where we first meet Leonard (Joaquin Phoenix) making a delivery for his father's dry cleaning business, deciding instead to jump off a bridge in suicidal dejection: Leonard is a lost soul, bipolar to boot, a wannabe photographer who has just been crushed by the end of a relationship (both partners decide that marriage won't work because they both carry the gene for Tay Sachs disease, a fact that would prevent their having healthy children).  Salvaged by pjazzersby, Leonard proceeds to his parent's (Isabella Rossellini and Moni Monoshov) apartment, the setting for a careful preparation of Leonard for taking over the family business.  A potential buyer has a daughter Sandra (Vanessa Shaw) and  the plan is to have Leonard marry into the new family for business reasons.  At the same time Leonard meets Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow), a young woman caught up in the throes of an affair with a married man.  Leonard must decide between the beautiful Michelle and the available Sandra and the film deals with all the problems of this critical moment in the life of Leonard who is ill equipped to make any semblance of reasonable decisions.Many viewers will want to endure this dreary love story simply to see the 'last film' of Joaquin Phoenix, and while the performances are uniformly good, the story itself is the problem.  Life is bumpy, yes, but there are usually occasional moments of light to relieve the tension.  Grady Harp, July 09",The Dark Side,1246752000,"07 5, 2009"
"I was so looking forward to this show, mostly because of Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  I couldn't think of a better actor to play the part.

"I feel like this isn't the right venue for Dark Minions, but then again, I'm not sure what would be. It's not quite off kilter enough to be an Adult Swim comedy, though it does have moments of very Robot Chicken sensibility; It's too weed cursing focused to be a show for adolescents, though I feel like with a little adjusting down, this would go over very well with the 12 15 set; It's got a little too much plot to be a video game, though I think a Ratchet and Clank esque platformer with these characters would be pretty funny and have endless options for gameplay. Given that 75% of the show is still in animatics, it just screams unfinished, but I think that extends to the thought about the show as well. There are some great laughs in there, as a Galactic Overlord dealing with normal people needs and (to even greater success) bureaucracy is just inherently funny, but the weed jokes are lame (as they are most of the time), and something about the format (both claymation and the storyboard animatics) just doesn't play well to most types of humor.

"ANGELS CREST is not a perfect movie: there are so many undeveloped sidebars that keeping everyone in a place where they seem to fit into the tale is difficult.  But there are some powerful performances here and some cause for reflection that makes the movie very worthwhile watching. Based on the novel by the same name written by Leslie Schwartz, adapted for the screen by Catherine Trieschmann, and directed by Gaby Dellal, the story deals with numerous interactions of a small town populated with alcoholics, drug abusers, adulterers, and other strange types and how they deal with a tragedy that makes no sense.Nate Denton (Ameko Eks Mjazz Carroll) is a 3 year old son of Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekkar in a breakout performance that deserves attention) who awakens one morning in his pathetic home to tell his beloved single dad that it is snowing.  The father son bond is strong and Ethan dresses them both to go out to view the beauty of the snowy countryside in their old truck.  When they arrive at a perfect spot, Ethan turns to the backseat to take Nate out to make snowmen, but Nate has fallen asleep in this safety car seat.  Ethan makes the truck warm, locks the truck and walks out to view the spectacle of winter, the deer, and the eloquent mountains.  In a few minutes he returns   and Nate is gone!  Ethan is terrified, begins shouting his son's name as he searches for him.  The town is alerted and a search party begins.  Nate's mother alcoholic mother Cindy (Lynn Collins) is notified of Nate's missing and begins her tirade on every person she meets.  After an overnight search for Nate, Ethan discovers Nate's frozen body and is devastated. Ethan is taken into custody for a death stemming from negligence and the townspeople form sides as to Ethan's guilt.  Among them is a waitress Angie (Mira Sorvino) and her small daughter Rosie (Emma Macgillivray), Ethan's friend Rusty (Joseph Morgan), a lesbian couple (Elizabeth McGovern and Kate Walsh), Cindy's preachy  mother (Barbara Williams). and the local police.  The town brings in the District Attorney (Jeremy Piven) who obviously has secrets of his won that mirror Ethan's crisis.  The story is resolved in a strange and tragic manner, leaving many crises unsolved.Thomas Dekkar gives such a fine performance that we are able to see inside his heart and head and soul.  The supporting cast conveys the small town response to a tragedy among their own   who is guilty of what and how could the incident have ever occurred.  There are many ideas created by the writers and the characters that are never realized fully, but the sense of human response to an accident is staggeringly real.  There is much more to this film in retrospect, after watching it, that haunts the viewer.

"Iris (Brittany Snow) has a brother who needs a bone marrow transplant. The creepy Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) offers to pay for it if she wins a game of a sadistic &#34;would you rather,&#34; one that we quickly discover is played to the death. 8 people are jazzembled in a dining room and forced at gun point. Since Iris is the only person we know anything about, everyone but Scooby Doo can figure this one out.Amy, played by porn star Sasha Grey, is an aggressive player who immediately plays to win. Shepard has an obnoxious son (Robin Taylor) who insults the players.There is a fairly decent intensity factor with this film, but it really doesn't stimulate the grey matter. The whole set up is rather inane. If you like the &#34;ten little Indians&#34; style movies with slasher elements, this one is satisfactory as long as you keep your expectations low. Perhaps 5 stars on a Red Box rental scale.If you liked this film you might also like &#34;Truth or Die&#34; which I thought was superior.Parental Guide: F bomb, no sex or nudity. Attempted rape.

"Thanks to Amazon Prime, we watch many films.  Some of them are quite forgettable.  This one was not.We are interested in films purely as entertainment.  The acting talents of Ciar&aacute;n Hinds made this film special.  We are less impressed with Aidan Quinn, but perhaps that came from the sleazy character he played so well. How is it that we had not zeroed in on Hinds years ago?  His name was barely known to us before The Eclipse, and we are not sure how we failed to notice his portrayal of Dumbledore's brother in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  We'll even pull Jane Eyre out and watch that one again, now that we know who played Rochester.In this film, my wife and I &#34;discovered&#34; Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, quite belatedly.As the film itself, I am one of those people who want a clearly defined ending or at least a strong implication that one is imminent.

It's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good, others rather stupid, even if you accept the premise of a comic book world. The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson, each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show; it wouldn't do to have the characters change and grow.I'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season.",Wooden Acting,1358899200,"01 23, 2013"
"The Orphanage (Juan Antonion Bayona, 2007)I was thrilled with The Orphanage just after I first saw it, and was all set to go round comparing it to Pan's Labyrinth like everyone else is doing. But then I got behind and didn't start writing this review for a week, and when I sat down to do so, I realized I'd forgotten a great deal of it. It took some serious brain wracking and a consultation of a plot synopsis for me to start remembering scenes from the movie that had impressed me.Laura (Mar Adentro's Belen Rueda) moves back to her childhood home, an abandoned orphanage, looking to refurbish it and start a smaller, more intimate home for disabled children. She and her family aren't even settled in. however, when her autistic son finds himself some imaginary friend   but just how imaginary are they, and what do they want with him? Distressed by this turn of events, Laura turns to paranormal investigators to find out what's going on.I think my problems with remembering the film have to do with my seeing Saint Ange last month, which riffs on many of the same themes and is, simply, a better and more memorable movie. Still, Bayona's first big screen feature film does outdo a number of recent Spanish supernatural flicks that have made it over the Atlantic (viz, the awful Darkness). A second viewing reminded me what I liked about it the first time   the acting is mostly solid, the atmosphere is well done, the pacing and direction are both first rate. Definitely recommended, but I'd suggest watching Saint Ange around the same time for a compare and contrast session. *** ","Not Pan's Labyrinth, but not bad.",1219190400,"08 20, 2008"

"It's always the same: writers at this level never do seem to overcome the contradictions of their own creations.Marseillaise, being a vampire and having the power to change people's minds  wants to go out with a gal he knows, a human. So, why not just gaze into her eyes and convince her she's in love with him? Or, that she's horny and wants to have sex with him? Having the power to convince people by a vampiric mind meld precludes any wants of that sort. Ok, so maybe he wants her 'true love.' But why wait for the first date? Just, you know, make it happen. It's these types of things that make me yawn.However, after two episodes, and I've never read any Ann Rice  although I did see an Ann Rice novel turned into a Broadway show I watched in person in NYC, and it was quite engaging and thought provoking  but the writing is on the level of a cheap soap opera, because that's what it is. It's marginally as good as Sanctuary, and no where close to Star Gate Atlantis or Star Trek Next Generation Deep Space Nine, or Enterprise. Yes, those can be cheesy, but the writing is coherent.I know there are a lot of people here who have followed this series from the Dairies. I have no truck with you. You most likely watch the these types of series for other reasons than I do. I watch them for consistency in plot, character, morality ethical philosophical issues that make me think, and tactical strategies that make logical sense. So, when I see contradictions, I lose a little interest until after too many, I simply stop watching. This is what happened after  ""The River in Reverse.""I just finished ""The River in Reverse."" Same thing again, and after this last episode, I've figured out where the writers are coming from. It's a Vampire Soap Opera. Or, put another way, a soap opera with vampires. Or, put another way, no way to make sense of what people do.The main point of watching soap operas is to get your emotions yanked by people doing stupid things to each other. Case point: Nickolaus can't be killed. He can't even be subdued. Really? How about this: Instead of wrapping some chains around his arms and then having a couple of weak flunkies hold them, why not fire a few iron harpoons through him like whalers use to do to whales where the loose ends of the chains are brewed into 10' x 10' concrete blocks, then dump him in 20 feet of solid concrete? I have another idea. Why not cut his head off? Oh wait, here's another more modern solution, a 30mm cannon round in his head (If he lives, well, ok, but that 30mm round is going to vaporize half his body. Maybe they could call the next episode ""The Torso w o a HEAD!""). Really? This is stupid. And then at the end of the episode, we're suppose to feel sorry for a psychopathic murderer? Please! This is 8th grade mentality, people, with a dose of unbelievable tossed in to make sure your completely brain dead. It's really sad too becsaue the acting is great and the idea superb.Overall impression:Acting: Pretty darn decent. Actors are believable. It would be nice is casting would work on getting some normal looking people as I doubt all people are as beautiful as they are in these types of series  which is really non reality. Conversely, in Game of Thrones, you get all sorts of people, not all pretty, which makes the entire series feel more real and emerges you into the plots.Writing: As stated. A sell out to a lower mentality who needs cheap thrills by having their emotions yanked again and again, no matter how idiotic the ideas get to yank them.FX: Good. Nothing cheesy about the FX.Plot: Well, it's all about power, hubris, and emotions. It would be nice if the writers had enough skill to pull that off. Instead, they go for cheap emotional thrills, much like a bad horror flick goes for the cheap adrenaline rush.Conclusion: If you're looking for cheap emotional thrills at the expense of coherent story line, and you like soap operas, go for it. You'll get your fix almost every 3 minutes. However, if you have more than an 8th grade mentality and you need your brain challenged on a critical level, in that you need some semblance of coherency in plot, you'll really be dissapointed. This is purely a soap opera where the writer's goal is to simply yank your emotional chain with unbelievably incoherent events unrelated to any real thought process. Think cheap horror flick and you have it, except the goal here is to give the viewer a cheap emotional fix rather than a quick shot of adrenaline.","The Contradictions of Power, and Bad Writing",1384732800,"11 18, 2013"

"This lukewarm comedy is about a young couple (Ben and Lindsey) dealing with the aftermath of the Rapture, which includes flaming rocks constantly falling from the sky, occasional showers of blood, and an Anti Christ named Earl, although he'd prefer it if you called him Beast. There's some kind of plot involving Beast's attempt to steal Lindsey from Ben, but really that's just an excuse to showcase some apocalyptic humor sight gags as well as the movie's fairly impressive array of comedic talent.There are quite a few problems here, however. Foremost among them, the script    by the same guy who brought us Bill & Ted lo these many years ago    doesn't have the steam to stay interesting. Second, although I've often enjoyed her in the many supporting roles I've seen her in, I'm now convinced Anna Kendrick just doesn't have the chops to carry a film. Her portrayal of our leading lady, Lindsey, has all the riveting depth of a gljazz of water. (Her boyfriend, Ben, is also about as boring as characters get    his pjazzion is sandwiches    and the actor who portrays him is immediately forgettable.) Likewise, I love Craig Robinson, but his Beast is so cartoonishly one note that it becomes tired pretty quickly, not to mention it robs his character of what little menace he's supposed to have. And he's definitely supposed to have some menace. He's the Anti Christ, for Pete's sake. Add some story twists that make no sense at all (you know a movie's gone off the rails when it sacrifices coherency for the sake of an easy laugh), as well as a constant (and completely unnecessary) voice over by Lindsey that becomes more and more annoying the longer it goes on, and you've got all the ingredients for a flub.However! All is not lost. The comedians they got to work on this do their darnedest and the results are not without their merits. Rob Corddry, Thomas Lennon, Ken Jeong, Paul Scheer, John Higgins, Rob Huebel (probably my favorite of the film), Ana Gasteyer, and even Robinson when he isn't mugging it up all turn out some pretty solid and laugh worthy performances.

"Being a devoted follower of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch series of novels, I approached this pilot with caution.  On the plus side, Connelly himself was involved in the adaptation as both a producer and co writer, so I jazzumed it wasn't going to be as much of a travesty as, say, Tom Cruise's incarnation as JACK REACHER (Lee Child actually endorsed that one and did a cameo   go figure). The production values are decent, and Titus Welliver is, aside from the ridiculous sideburns, pjazzable as Bosch.  I just prefer a little more charisma.  35 years ago, actors like Gene Hackman or Roy Scheider would have nailed the role in their sleep.  Beyond Welliver (and Scott Wilson in a small role), I have issues with the casting.  Jamie Hector totally fails to register as easy going partner Jerry Edgar.  Anne Wersching, who was so magnetic on 24, is made up to look like Whistler's Mother when she first appears as beautiful rookie Julie Brasher, and hardly improves as the show progresses.  And I simply cannot buy Lance Reddick as Irvin Irving, Bosch's devious superior cum nemesis.  On top of all that, I found the direction listless.  The crucial shooting incident that lands Bosch in court was so indifferently staged that I was tempted to stop watching were it not for loyalty to the source material.  So, if this goes to series, I might check it out to see if it gets better, but it's definitely not on my must watch list.","Kind of OK, kind of meh, with casting problems",1393459200,"02 27, 2014"

For most of the episode he was abrasive and obnoxious, as only Baldwin can do, and that part was great.  But it was spoiled by the sickly sweet script with its cloying need to always impart a parable instead of reality. Baldwin's character in short became someone totally unbelievable. It was a shame to waste him like this but I enjoyed the part where he played the obnoxious reporter. It will take a similar guest star for me to tune in again.",even alec baldwin can't reinvigorate this show,1397001600,"04 9, 2014"

"I really like Morgan Freeman; he seems to be especially good in movies about animals.  ""March of the Penguins"" was outstanding, and ""Dolphin Tale,"" while still being a ""weepy,"" was an excellent film.  Rarely will you find a more sympathetic character than Winter, one of the dolphins in Florida who are still worth rooting for.But Mr. Freeman and people?  Well usually they get along just fine.  But not here.  He's curmudgeony, but not curmudgeony enough.  He doesn't think much of it when a disabled kid is hopping around like a rabbit, and he's way too helpful when a little girl    who reminds me of Abigail Breslin in ""Little Miss Sunshine,"" which surely couldn't be a bad thing    comes poking around looking for inspiration on her next novel.  OK; maybe not novel.  But at least three difficult words of the week to appease her mom.This starring role reminds me of the character played already by Clint Eastwood in ""Grand Torino,"" a film that really worked for me.  Mr. Eastwood played it just right.  He was curmdudgeony and he was darned well proud of it.  Sure, Mr. Eastwood eventually came around, but it took huge effort and time.  And those are some things that this film, director, and Mr. Freeman should have used for inspiration.This movie is pandering, and it does one thing that a movie never must do with me:  play with my emotions.  Once you do that you lose me, and they lost me at ""hello"" (and maybe ""Welcome to Belle Isle"").  But I'll still go three because I am a fan of Mr. Freeman and Virginia Madsen, as I've said ad nauseum before.  I'm just not a fan of this film.

"The concept behind this series is the current NSA spying scandal on steroids. &#34;The Machine&#34;, built by the quaint Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), allegedly spies on everyone everywhere all the time and &#34;sees everything&#34;, which is of course preposterous. Even more preposterous is the premise that, in the case of this show and for dramatically convenient purposes, the &#34;persons of interest&#34; the machine selects as about to be victims or perps are confined entirely to New York City, so Harold's solemn declaration that, even though the government declined to do anything about all the &#34;irrelevant&#34; cases the machine identifies, he will is the final link in the absolute absurdity of the basic plot concept. Of course he works in secret and remains a shadowy figure who is sort of the ultimate computer geek.All that notwithstanding (and Finch is superbly played by Emerson), the story lines and the other main characters   two in particular   make this series quite addictive. First, of course, is Jim Caveizel as John Reese, the action arm and steely avenging angel of Finch's secretive plan to thwart the hinge of fate. His &#34;man in a suit&#34; vigilante character with the husky, whispery voice and lethal fighting skills is irresistible, but the other irresistible character is Taraji Henson's detective Joss Carter who, as a former interrogator for the army in Iraq and Afghanistan, is supposed to be a really tough &#34;hard jazz&#34; that prisoners (and perps) &#34;really don't want to meet&#34;. She is never remotely believable as that. What she is, however, is incredibly courageous, effective, and just   the sweetest, kindest, softest, most adorable, and prettiest interrogator cop any criminal could ever hope to meet and Henson plays her to perfection. On top of everything else that's so appealing about this character, Taraji Henson has the most beautiful skin I've ever seen, as smooth and creamy as warm liquid caramel. Predictably, but unforgivably, the writers have her killed at the end of the third season by Simpson   a dirty cop played with compellingly evil brutality by Robert Burke. Even the normally icy Reese is ultimately pulled in by Carter's gentle magnetism. Having begun by being relentlessly hunted by her, at the end he credits her with having &#34;changed&#34; him and then kisses her   an exquisitely tender moment you know instinctively heralds the end of her character, and sure enough, she is shortly thereafter gunned down in the street along with Reese who survives only to have her die in his arms. Many main characters are killed off in the course of TV series, but the loss of Henson's Carter is somehow devastating and almost literally cuts the heart out of the show. Other characters are likeable, interesting, even admirable; she was the only one who was genuinely lovable.Replacing her female character with the beautiful and extremely deadly but emotionless Samantha Shaw (played by the incredible Sarah Shahi) does not change that lamentable fact. There are so many shadowy groups of bad guys   from the vast dirty cop cabal HR, to the Russian mafia, to criminal empire builder Elias (Enrico Colantoni) and his henchmen, to the various government groups (FBI, CIA) hunting for Finch, Reese, and the machine, to Root (Amy Acker) who has developed a &#34;special&#34; and &#34;intimate&#34; relationship with the machine, to a new and still mysterious government group headed by the villainous Diane Claypool (Camryn Manheim)   that it becomes difficult to follow (can't tell the players without a program) and somewhat fatiguing, but they are all so interesting and keep the action moving so well that you overlook such absurd overkill in the conspiracy department. Since the show is so good, legions of implausibilities notwithstanding, no doubt the network will cancel it.",Addictive show,1388707200,"01 3, 2014"

"""Familiarity breeds contempt,"" observed my girlfriend as she threw me a sideways glance. But I'm sure she was referring to LEVERAGE, and I was quick to counter her remark. Four seasons in for LEVERAGE, and, yeah, this is around when you start looking for signs of complacency or creakiness. Over time the show, for me, has achieved that ""comfort food"" status. It's one of the shows I turn to when I crawl in from a hard day's work. Four seasons in, LEVERAGE has still got teeth, still has freshness. I understand that there's a formula in play. But I'm still not tired of the act.Although, okay, if I must pick a nit, I think Aldis Hodge (""Hardison"") is flirting with being too over the top with his urban cool mugging. I'm rolling my eyes so much, this old lady from Pechanga keeps yelling ""Jackpot!""LEVERAGE tends to be an episodic series, although plot threads do surface which form a connective tissue and provide a measure of narrative continuity. In Season 4, our grifters are alerted to a bug in their apartment and ensuing episodes alert us of who's doing the spying and why. It pays off in the Season 4 finale. And, in the ""About Dang Time"" department, there's progression in the relationships between Hardison and Parker and between Nate and Sophie. In fact, romantic complications end up informing the development of a few of the heists. And, as usual, while there's intrigue in how those twisty heists are executed and in how those unexpected wrinkles are sidestepped, the true investment lies in watching the interactions amongst our five do gooding grifters.Highlight episodes (for me, anyway):  ""The Ten Li'l Grifters Job""   The team attends a murder mystery gala but, when a real homicide surfaces which implicates Nate, is forced to jazzume the role of a murder mystery organizing group.  ""The Boiler Room Job""   The team goes after ""The Mako,"" an accomplished fellow con man and descendant of the legendary grifter, The Yellow Kid. Figuring that their target is too slick to con, they intend to just straight up rob him.  ""The Cross My Heart Job""   A crooked defense contractor steals a heart intended for a dying 15 year old. To keep the organ from flying out, the team, handicapped without their usual tools, has to work up a caper to steal an airport under a two hour deadline.  ""The Queen's Gambit Job""   Interpol Agent Sterling recruits Nate's team to lift a nuclear centrifuge calibration weight from a maximum security highrise in Dubai during an international chess tournament. Are you ready for a humanizing moment for Sterling? Also, a nun gets coldcocked (okay, a fake nun).  ""The Office Job""   Our grifters infiltrate a struggling greeting card company by posing as efficiency experts. But they didn't count on that documentary crew currently filming.  ""The Girls' Night Out Job""   In the first of two overlapping episodes, Jeri Ryan returns as Parker, Sophie, and Tara (Ryan) cross paths with an international man of mystery.  ""The Boys' Night Out Job""   In the second of two overlapping episodes, as the girls engage in an impromptu spy caper, Nate, Hardison, and Eliot have a dangerous reunion with lovable loser Jack Hurley (from Season 1's ""The 12 Step Job"") who again is in a jam with mobsters.  ""The Gold Job""   When dishonest gold dealers show up on Nate Ford's radar, Hardison gets an opportunity to mastermind a team con.  ""The Radio Job""   In the first of the two part season finale, the crew breaks into a patent office, but, more importantly, when a hostage situation emerges and the fuzz show up, Eliot gets to channel John McClane from DIE HARD. Co starring Tom Skerritt as Nate's dad, Jimmy Ford.  ""The Last Dam Job""   Concludes the two parter as a revenge driven Nate is forced to recruit for backup as the team goes up against an old and formidable foe (featuring the return of past guest stars Richard Chamberlain, Wil Wheaton (who is awesome here!), Clayne Crawford, and Kari Matchett).

"Note: I only saw the first 20 30 minutes with XFinity On Demand.This show, advertised as a ""Limited Series,"" whatever that means, has a great cast (Sigourney Weaver, Ciaran Hinds, Carla Gugino and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn) and a premise that slowly unfolds. What could be the problem?Within the first two minutes, there's a slew of profanity that heretofore you'd think could only be aired on a cable network like Showtime, HBO, Encore, MAX or Starz. That, coupled with the very frank dialogue, was okay with me. I'm merely making a note of this, as the series is TV PG and the language sounded like it belongs on television series' like Shameless, The Sopranos, etc. PG means that the language, if there's any, is MILD (hell and darn) and infrequent (ie. occurring not more than twice).What really did NOT sit well with me was that there's a sex scene between Bud and Eva. Do they need to show that on television? The show is rated TV PG. However, the language and sex scene really amped it up to a TV MA. Then around 15 minutes later, there's a nasty scene between two males. Disgusting. Does every television show these days feel the sick need to throw in one of those people into a show? And even worse, depict them copulating like the male inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah?I turned it off just as the two males were...e[...] Disgusting. Nasty. Anti biblical. Immoral.

"Very few television series can boast that they have been blessed with the greatest production values ever, as well has having a remarkable cast and crew that knew they were making something for generations of people to enjoy. ""Rome"" is one such series. A huge ratings winner when it was first broadcast on HBO, the series is set in Ancient Rome and deals with the death of Mark Antony, as well as Ancient Rome's transition from Republic to Empire, and Caesar's Invasion of Gaul. The backdrop of the story deals with the beautiful heterosexual relationship of two soldiers, Lucius and Titus, who find their lives intertwined and who basically fight for each other, at times often to the point of risking their own lives. What I have always admired ""Rome"" for is its depiction of how close it came in presenting itself as a series that actually looks like a theatrical release. The budget was probably the highest for any series and it shows on the screen. From the sets to the costumes, the producers were not shy in their attempt in bringing viewers back to a time in European history that many did not know much about, except for those who excelled in history while in grade school or college. This set comes with 12 episodes housed in a splendid DVD case made out of thick, strong cardboard that protects the dics. The set also comes with a slew of bonuses including audio commentary, interviews with the cast and crew, and so much more. Add this set to your DVD archive as you will view it over and over.

The film is based around teenagers, but isn't like your average teenage slasher.

"You'll hear the phrase ""Total Package"" so many times that you'll become immune to it.  The fact that it's being used in relation to a child doesn't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go, it's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam.  Everyone ""wins"" or ""places.""  The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the ""Queen"" of each ""division"" is also not a winner.  There's a set of ""supreme"" crowns and a grouping of ""Ultimate"" crowns which is the ""winner"" of the entire pageant.  Oh, whatever.

Never mind that the cost of preparing for a pageant will more than likely run you more than $5000 and lots of prep time.The pageants reward and judge on beauty as it's the only area that cannot be dropped. Beauty is finite and transitory.  The parents are both turning their children into monsters and leaving their children with no usable skills once their children's beauty ages out. The most appalling thing here is hearing the parents justify the waste of time and excuse the emphasis on ""beauty.""Furthermore, the ""modeling"" routines these children are taught are both cartoonish and ghoulish.  It's a sick, incestuous training wherein coaches teach them the same ridiculous poses they used as children that in turn make the children look almost clownish on stage and no one stops it.

"The film covers the months from the 14 July 1789 storming of the Bastille to the eve of the arrest of the royal family that fall. The action, told from the perspective of a favorite servant of French Queen Marie Antoinette, takes place in the magnificent state rooms and gardens of Versailles and in the teaming warren of the below stairs of the palace. Like many French films, it is long on emotion, sexual innuendo, and beautiful locations, but glosses over the facts and the tragedy. It is mentioned that there is little food, but no explanation is offered of the precipitating cause of the French Revolution. The already fragile and mismanaged French economy had been in a severe economic downturn, since the mjazzive fissure eruptions of Icelandic volcano Laki, beginning in June 1783 and ending in February 1784, disrupted global climate, causing acid rains that destroyed crops, and livestock, and created sores on people who worked outdoors and severe winters that froze the Mississippi over as far south as New Orleans and fogs that disrupted global trade. This information could have been worked into the plot through the serving girl's meetings with the learned palace librarian.The film provides a snapshot of the elegance and emptiness of life at Versailles in its final days, while avoiding the tragedy and ugliness of the French Revolution. In my humble opinion the film ends too soon. It ends well before the frivolous Queen Marie Antoinette holds her 7 year old son for hours, only to have him torn from her arms to be systematically beaten and starved. In the movie, the children are relegated to one brief scene of the Queen holding them. The little girl will barely survive and the very young prince is doomed to die. The audience could have watched the spoiled Austrian princess rise to the occasion of her imprisonment and death. She may have lived as a frivolous spoiled child, but she died as a mother and queen.

This one tries to skirt some of those obligations.Here's the scoop. A handful of female inmates are granted a 2 day pjazz to the outside to see if they can re jazzimilate into society (right). This follows them on their attempts.Other than Uschi Digard and Candy Samples I didn't know any of these actresses (actresses?). The schtick here is to get the girls out of the prison with the 2 day pjazz scenario. It opens with the obligatory shower scene and ensuing cat fight and is followed up with the girls visiting the prison psychiatrist as to why this 2 day pjazz can do them well. We then see how each uses the pjazz which amounts to little more than one sex scene after another.Yup. Cheap sets. Bad acting. Bad writing. Bad directing. But we're not here for that. We want the babes and there are babes aplenty. Problem is, everything is so bad the bare babes become tiresome after little time. Sex scenes, even soft core sex scenes, can be arousing. Not so here. They wear out their welcome pretty quick. The real highlights are seeing Uschi and Candy and even those left me wanting.There are a lot of these kinds of flicks out there and most (maybe all) are better than this one.

"I gave this one a try because I'd seen Buffy the Vampire Slayer ( and generally liked it) and Angel (often liked it, especially in the early episodes) and liked Eliza Dushku in each of them. I was never as happy with this series  not liking the concept of people renting out their bodies to be &#34;imprinted&#34; with recorded memories  personalities of other individuals to be used as desired. Ms. Dushku could perform quite a range of characters whether as a prostitute or agent on a mission for me she was really the only reason to watch Dollhouse.That unaired pilot, I think they called it on the DVD, &#34;Echo&#34; obviously was rewritten for the second season finale, not much better here than there.

"To quote Keanu: ""Whoa!"" What just happened? I just saw the first episode of ZERO HOUR, and I feel like someone just gave me a brain wedgie or that I just got audited. Anthony Edwards makes his (what should've been) triumphant return to televisionland, and I was prepared to whoop and holler because I find the guy so darn sincere and likable. He plays Brooklynite Hank Galliston, editor of Modern Skeptic magazine. Hank is a journalist who prefers facts over sensationalism, much to the chagrin of his two young reporters (they'd rather write about werewolves and skunk apes). Hank Galliston is a man still very much in love with his wife, Leila (Jacinda Barrett), she who runs a clock repair shop. Her sudden abduction by an international terr0rist provides the plot's impetus.ZERO HOUR rapidly constructs a dense mythology, and perhaps it's too dense too soon. And you should know that the rest of this paragraph isn't SPOILER free. The tangled narrative ropes in Nazis (and then frozen Nazis), a possibly satanic baby with creepy milky eyes, a religious secret society preparing for the impending apocalypse, a map captured in a tiny gem, and a mysterious tarp covered artifact that had better not be the Ark of the Covenant.I'm worried about this show; I'm not sure it knows its identity. I don't know if it can follow thru on its ambitions. This first episode, ""Strike,"" comes off as bizarre and impenetrable and confusing. The good news is that it IS just the first episode. Hopefully, further episodes will take a more coherent approach.On the plus side, I liked the sense of urgency and the sense of scope. Dire circumstances compel our characters to embark on globe trotting excursions, and their journeys open up the narrative even more and reinforce that theme of epic adventure. So far, the supporting cast fail to make an impression, but I'm very willing to let them grow on me. It's early yet, and I get the sense it'll take some serious committment to sit thru the unfolding of this riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma, encased in a tortilla. Anthony Edwards, for his part, retains his immense likability and he's talented enough to make any bit of dialogue sound convincing. I think it's an inspired bit of countercasting, having this unjazzuming looking guy play the puzzle solving action hero. I'm hanging my hat on further episodes, my fingers wistfully crossed for a measure of clarity and a sure sign that the show has found its pulse.

"This was a somewhat objective presentation of Wikileaks during its first few years. Interviewees range from former NSA officials to former Wikileaks employees and volunteers. The main character profiled, of course, is Julian Assange. Assange is portrayed as a hero for some, flawed computer geek to others, and narcissistic criminal to still more. Also profiled are Bradley Manning and Adrian Lamo, both of whom served to muddy the already murky business of leaking secrets to the general public. All three of these real life people appear, in the documentary, to have mental health issues while enjoying access to sensitive information. This is the recipe for the disaster played out on front pages of newspapers over some time.This documentary seems to strive for impartiality, but ultimately fails, as many documentaries do. We have plenty of opportunity to consider as many possible sides to an issue, organization or public personality when forming an opinion.If I had it to do over again, I would have pjazzed on paying $6.99 to rent this movie.

The premise is decent and the actors all seem capable, but I don't see how this show could work as a series; it's just not funny.

"I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie. However, you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck, but it was far worse than I expected. ""Liz and Dick"" is a bloody mjazzacre. For the record, I am actually a member of Team LiLo. As a child star, she showed great potential as a solid B actress (remember ""The Parent Trap,"" Freaky Friday,"" and of course the iconic ""Mean Girls?""). Then Lindsay Lohan grew up, went to rehab 50 times, got arrested 105 times, and unfortunately she hasn't shown a whole lot of promise since then. I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role. Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers, and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch. And I did. And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness, the entire movie is an epic disaster (the only saving graces are the costumes, so props to the wardrobe mistress). First, let's talk about Lindsay. Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does (as I recall, Liz's entire body wasn't covered in freckles). Unfortunately, LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role. What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs, speaking in her regular LiLo voice. There was no attempt to master Liz's signature dialect, or the way she carried herself, or absolutely anything at all. Heck, she didn't even try to ACT most of the time. Everything was completely half jazzed. Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall, her throws were just PITIFUL. It was insulting. The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act, but just happens to be a really bad actor (decked out in an even worse hairpiece). The sets are awful. The script is languid. And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever. (Like, they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby, but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film, so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and can't weigh more than 105 pounds. Rewrite, anyone?)Everything. Is. SO. AWFUL. If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television, like I was, you may end up pleasantly surprised in that ""Liz and Dick"" is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be. My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production, but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere. Bottom line: Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now. I am glad she didn't live to witness this monstrosity.","So, so, so, so, SO AWFUL!!!!",1353888000,"11 26, 2012"

Dr Lecter's character is sinister and oily I can't see what everyone finds so charming although that is good because all psych's are a little eccentric themselves( sorry for the generalization).

"This isn't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun.  Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards.  For example, Dex would never molest or kill a child, so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys.  This is not a defense of Dex, just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents; he maintains a good relationship with his sister, a cop; he works as a forensic examiner for the police; he fakes emotions as best he can with  his girlfriend and her kids; and feels nothing at all, most of the time, unless it's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C.

"First, if you've never seen a Trek film, now maybe the time...this is a solid movie, Trek or not...visually stunning, a wild paced trip with J.J.Abrams superb character banter.Star Trek is such a cultural icon and so a part of the collective unconsciousness that even a pjazzing familiarity is plenty enough to enjoy the new TREK MOVIE. J.J.Abrams of TV's LOST & the Mission Impossible series shows how the famous crew of the U.S.S. Enterprise first comes aboard to explore strange new worlds. Talk about ""no win scenario""...the big question in the minds of fans and non fans alike: can younger actors fill these enormous space boots.The answer is yes, but with a major role for the original Spock, Leonard Nimoy, time traveling of course, there's no need to worry about the absence of the original crew.Chris Pine's take on impulsive space cowboy James T. Kirk is no SNL parody of Shatner's portrayal but recognizable (although as the climax draws near he scores some very Capt. Kirk cljazzic moments ""I've got your gun.""). Zachary Quinto a.k.a Sylar Spock is perfect as a young Vulcan (with a girlfriend!). Karl Urban is dead on a Leonard ""Bones"" Mcoy with maybe the coolest intro in the film. Uhura is played by Zoe Saldana who is a great likeness of young Nichelle Nichols, but with so much more to do, than poor Nichelle. The same can't be said for Chekov, Sulu and Scott who had less important places in the big picture, but were each well played, Simon Pegg's Scotty was great fun.Without given too, much away, some answers....Does a ""Red Shirt"" die? Ho yeah...Does Kirk tear his shirt? Nah...Does Bones declare someone ""Dead, Jim?"" Sorta...Nerve Pinch? Got `em....Warp Speed?  The Best ever!!!....Beam ins and outs? Yes and much more (can you say space dive?)...How about the KOBAYASHI MARU test? I prequel has to have it right? Yes, it is in there and may even live up to expectations, too!Due to interference by a future Romulian, Nero, play brilliantly by Eric Bana, an alternate timeline is created. While strikingly similar to the original Trek, the movie ends with many things already clearly different from the series (like Capt. Pike's final fate).  In doing this 2 things are ultimately accomplished 1.) many Prequel   Series discontinuities are dispersed due to interference by Nero. 2.) the future of the Trek film franchise can continue without fear of rewriting any aspect of the show or films using the new cast.The Star Trek prequel hopefully will herald the reboot of the Star Trek franchise, it sure has the potential.

"England, 1519. King Henry VIII rules England and is beloved by his people. His wife, Queen Catherine of Aragon, is popular and the king's chancellor, Cardinal Wolsey, is able and formidable in administering the country and defeating plots against the throne. Another of Henry's advisors is Sir Thomas More, a man of great conscience and integrity whose respect and friendship the king values.However, it is a difficult time in Europe. The Lutheran heresy is raging unchecked in Germany and the Pope is unable to defeat it. King Francis I of France and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V are engaged in a deadly rivalry, both hoping to enlist England as an ally. With his queen   the Emperor's aunt   apparently unable to bear him a son, Henry also begins movements towards a divorce. When he falls in love with the beautiful Anne Boleyn, this matter becomes pressing and threatens a breakdown of relations with Rome.The Tudors is a television drama produced by the Showtime network and based on the life on Henry VIII, focusing on his relationships with his six wives and the political and religious turmoil that resulted. The first season covers a period of roughly eleven years, running from the accession of Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor (in 1519) to the death of Cardinal Wolsey (in 1530). However, real historical events are compressed, combined or moved around in the timeline to read better as part of the drama. The contentious marriage of Charles Brandon to Henry's sister Mary Tudor (slightly confusingly changed to Margaret in the TV series) happened in 1515, but is moved to later on to create an interesting mid season subplot, for example.The Tudors plays fast and loose with the details of real history, but like HBO's Rome before it, the show does succeed in getting across the events and complications of the period. The complexities of Henry's relationships with fellow European rulers and the Pope are recounted well, as is the seething tension within the English court. As a very rough introduction to the history of the period, The Tudors works, though those interested in the real events are referred to the many history books about the time.As drama and narrative, The Tudors is something of a mixed bag. The script is inclined towards the expositionary, with surprisingly little incidental flavour, and what there is is often questionable: a scene showing Henry VIII composing 'Greensleeves' is amusing but also cheesy and highly inaccurate (Henry VIII definitely did not write the music to the song and his authorship of the lyrics is questionable, at best). One of the strongest episodes in the season is the one where England is ravaged by disease, as it shows how Tudor England coped with such disasters and features more incidental scenes of life amongst the common folk than other episodes.The acting is mostly good, with the likes of Nick Dunning (Sir Thomas Boleyn) and Henzy Czerny (the Duke of Norfolk) providing able support. Henry Cavill (Charles Brandon and, more recently, the latest actor to play Superman) is good as one of Henry's few true friends, though he arguably may have made a better Henry VIII himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy gives an excellent performance as Catherine of Aragorn, mixing palpable fear and worry over not being able to give the king an heir with pride and anger at the thought of being set aside. Natalie Dormer is given the hard job of portraying Anne Boleyn, the woman a king plunged a nation into anarchy for, and almost pulls it off. She is hamstrung by the indifferent script, especially as the story skips large chunks of their courtship and the precise reasons for the king's fascination with her are left somewhat ambiguous: in the TV show she simply appears to play hard to get, fascinating the king who normally just has to nod his head to get a woman into bed with him. Given their seven year courtship and the intensity of Henry's feelings towards her, this feels rather inadequate as an explanation.Central to this first season is Sam Neill, who plays Cardinal Wolsey with just the right mix of intelligence, political scheming and ruthless anger. Wolsey is presented as something of an antagonistic figure, but he is also shown to be a caring family man (Wolsey had a wife and two children) and to be utterly devoted to the king. As Wolsey repeatedly fails to get the annulment Henry wants, he becomes more desperate and Neill portrays Wolsey's descent with pjazzion and intensity. Neill is possibly the highlight of the first season. Jeremy Northam also gives an excellent performance as Sir Thomas More, highlighting both More's well known piety, intelligence and integrity but also his darker side, such as his commitment to burning heretics and Protestants at the stake.Where the series falters   and it's quite a big misstep   is the casting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers in the central role of Henry VIII. Eight years prior to The Tudors, Rhys Meyers had played the coldly cunning role of Steerpike in the BBC's adaptation of Gormenghast, and bizarrely he seems to be playing Henry VIII in much the same manner. The real Henry VIII is noted for his charisma and vivaciousness, his force of personality sweeping up those around him. Whilst Rhys Meyers certainly nails the king's intelligence, confidence and raging temper when thwarted, his performance is also often cold, desperate and occasionally whiny. I can understand the idea of subverting the traditional image of the fat, middle aged Henry VIII by showing him as a young man in the prime of life, but Rhys Meyers simply fails to get across the complexities of the real historical figure.Fortunately, this is not quite as disastrous as it might be supposed: The Tudors may be about Henry VIII, but the series follows those around him more than the monarch himself, and the emphasis is on the court and period as a whole rather than on the one man by himself.From a technical viewpoint, the series is well directed. The use of CGI to flesh out the castles and stately homes of England is interesting and rather ahead of its time (and makes up for the fact that the show was filmed in Ireland, with limited or no access to some of the real locations portrayed in the series), though also sometimes distracting. Early in the season we have relatively brief camera shots of locations that try not to dwell on their computer generated nature. Later in the season we have rather distracting rapid camera movements and broad shots of locations which are clearly CGI and artificial (and whilst the CGI is good for 2007 and the show's limited budget, it's still not great), creating a bit of a dissonance once we switch to the live action scenes.The first season of The Tudors (***) is flashy, fun and enjoyable but also lightweight. The lack of historical accuracy is not a major problem   the show at least portrays the real events, if not always in the right order or with the correct details   though the uncharismatic performance of the lead actor and a sometimes indifferent and flavourless script certainly are. Luckily, most of the other actors are excellent and as a rough introduction to the time period and events, the show does work.",File under 'guilty pleasure',1370649600,"06 8, 2013"
"I'm going to be cautious in my rating for IFC's ""Portlandia"" due to the divisive nature of the show's reception. I know a lot of people who sampled the show during its six episode Season One run, and the consensus seemed to be split right down the middle. Some called the show hilarious, while some found it a belabored missed opportunity. Almost nobody was left standing in the middle. Obviously, if you already love or hate the show, nothing in any review is going to change your mind. My commentary is mainly focused on new viewers who might be thinking about trying the program out. I might suggest you try to catch an episode on IFC (they rerun frequently) for free, but also on Amazon Instant Video if you don't have that network on your cable provider. I can understand why some would really connect with the show's ideology but I can also see why some would be less enthused by its meandering presentation. For myself, I did love the premise of the show but oftentimes thought sketches needed to be tightened up.The Good: ""Portlandia,"" first and foremost, starts with a fantastic idea. Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein have created a comedy that speaks to a very specific portion of the population. In a perfect recreation of indie hipster angst, the show skewers a world in which people are consumed by political correctness. The beauty of ""Portlandia"" is that it both embraces the self importance, superiority, and silliness of this extreme sect while poking gentle fun with it. It really is spot on in showcasing this dichotomy and Portland stands as an ideal muse for illustrating this too cool for school mentality. The self aware characters (Armisen and Browstein play a stable of recurring bits) are so proper, in fact, they are often undone by trying to be idealized models of this elevated consciousness. It's an inspired idea, and when it works  it hits very real highs. People relate to the show because they are or know people exactly like the ones represented.The Not So Good: Maybe the people that don't connect as much are lacking the relationships necessary to put the show's environment in context. If, for example, you live in Portland or a place like it  it would be hard not to be amused by the premise of the show. However, premise aside, the show sometimes lacks a comedic timing to make even its funniest bits work to perfection. Skits tend to meander a bit, sometimes with a seeming lack of focus. I realize that this is also kind of the point of the premise, but I felt so many sequences went on just a beat too long. If you're looking for big joke based laughs, this is more character driven or situational comedy. Very few moments end in big punchlines. The big laughs, in fact, are infrequent  most of the time, I was gently amused.Armisen and Browstein create some colorful characters (some more successful than others), but the absolute highlight of the season is to catch the unexpected guest stars. Kyle MacLachlin is fantastic as the mayor, Aimee Mann playing herself as a maid is a hoot. Likable Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation) pops up, but is underutilized. Steve Buscemi has perhaps the season's most mystifying cameo. And there are a few more surprises, and it's fun to see how many people were willing to drop by for a scene or two. Overall, ""Portlandia"" is a definite (but cautious) recommendation for the right audience. Again, I think its ability to both embrace and satirize the ridiculous is its strongest jazzet. Season One is six episodes running shy of thirty minutes each. Catch up now, as Season Two starts on IFC in January 2012.

"This used to be be the best written show on television. The characters and situations were authentic to their setting. It showed parts of America that are not usually shown. But in season 3, its fallen off a cliff in terms of quality.All the interesting characters, situations and writing that characterized the first and second seasons are gone. Its turning into a generic 1970s style cop show with a predictable body count every week. Its starting to feel more like the old show McCloud than the old justfied. They spent a whole season moving in a certain direction with Raylan and his boss. Now they have seemingly abandoned every bit of it. The stuff with Boyd has become so messed up that the show has started to poke fun at itself over it. The realism is gone. The authenticity of the setting is gone. The show is just going through the motions lining up a new set of disposable bad guys who will all be dead when they pile up the bodies at the end of the season.Raylan's father was a great character originally. But after Raylan shot him, part of what was there was gone. And when they got rid of his wife last season, all the remaining air kind of went out of the character.They can't even bother to get the details of drugs and drug related crimes right.

"Season 3, the last season of Gavin and Stacey, is the unfortunate end of a great situation comedy.  Not since the best addictive television comedies like Seinfeld and Cheers before it, has there been such a show worthy of a dedicated following  and sadly America doesn't even know about it. I just happened upon Gavin and Stacey and after a couple shows, I watched 3 seasons of it in 3 days. The best aspect of this show is that there are truly talented actors who wholly inhabit their characters.  The most annoying, off putting, characteristic of any show for me, particularly a comedy, is when an actor is constantly aware of what he's doing  the audience is watching him act.  His her, ego is on full display completely thrilled at this opportunity to strut his stuff in a show.  That doesn't happen in Gavin and Stacey.  Some of these characters are over the top, and you believe them, even love them for their idiosyncrasies.  Gavin and Stacey are two very nice people, who you might know.  They are genuine and sweet and innocently funny.  But the characters that surround them  their families and friends  are straight up crazy, funny, flawed, sweet, loving, honest people  just like your aunts, uncles and friends.  Pam, Gavin's mom, so mom ish  loving her prince of a son, sexy with her husband, sometimes trying to be who she isn't, giving and selfish, fussy and warm  is simply funny.  Smithy, Gavin's best friend, is somewhat rotund, cutting back on his eating with a 6 pack of chicken, corn on the cob and other sides, at the end of a night of partying; always greets Gavin with a shared hip hop song and choreography  with Gav's mom and dad joining in when they're around  quite capably, I might add; rolling on the floor in a tussle with his younger sister  another hip hop master; and, an all round hysterically funny good guy!  Brin, Stacey's uncle is embodied by Rob Brydon, of The Trip...OMG, I adore him... Brin lingers just a minute too long when he hugs Gav, and he is harboring some secret experience...that happened on a fishing trip with his nephew, Stacey's brother...it was very cold on that trip... And, last but certainly not least, Nessa, Stacey's best friend.  Nessa is a hearty (like Smithy) Welsh lady, who is completely blunt in her honest, slightly stilted, take on the world.  She can jazzist her bouncer friends at the local night club, and go head to head with Smithy on a KFC mega meal, where a butter dripping ear of corn becomes an unexpected bit of foreplay.  The only thing that an American audience might take a bit of getting used to are the British and Welsh accents...but please, give it a minute...the Welsh accents become another great joke.

"I think the show could be improved a whole lot. The ladies get into a fight and the cameras capture every angle   just goofy quick shots with funky camera angles. This is an obvious and overused method to simulate fights without having to choreograph the action or use stunt personnel. You can't for a moment suspend belief.This demonstrates how the show is organized. It's a certainty that even the smallest arguments are scripted. Simulated drama was unnecessary. Meaningful drama would have emerged with more filming and editing (i.e., a bigger production budget).These are all smart ladies. They are not glib like this in real life   the opposite. It's difficult for me to continue watching more than ten minutes at a time despite my liking each of the women.Nevertheless, there are redeeming aspects. The way the ladies talk probably couldn't be highly scripted. They talk like their fathers and uncles from the Outfit. They use old expressions that still capture meanings and convey not only street smarts but a little old world wisdom.Too bad the women are presented as high maintenance brawlers.

"First, let me mention that, Michael Scott aside, I was a fan of this show just as much for Jim and Pam, and if they end their relationship on a ""divorce"" note I will NEVER invest in another show by these producers. Guess what? Breaking up a happy family to go out on a high minded story arc is a betrayal to the fans, and here's one more fundamental truth: DIVORCE ISN'T FUNNY!!! These characters deserve to end the show as much in love and together as when they started.I am a STALWART fan of the series, and have been since it's American debut. I think the humor of the show was that most of the other people in the show were REAL people and Michael was the insane one. That is what the show was about, how a crazy manager interacts with real people. Michael was shocking, irrepressible, irredeemable, and loud, inappropriate at the worst and most inopportune moments, and almost entirely oblivious to it (which was also his saving grace). The moment a light of understanding hit his brain, he would suddenly become human, attempt to back pedal, and then begrudgingly apologize.It was this that made the show. When Michael left the office, the curtain should have closed, the lights turned up, and we should have been made to leave our seats. Instead, seasons 8 and 9 continued to turn the carcjazz over and make a mockery of the quirks of each character, way, way over emphasizing the suddenly, equally quirky traits of the staff. If it's one person being a fool and all around staring in awe and disbelief, that's an out of the ordinary moment. If everyone is cavorting around foolishly, there's no awe or disbelief.Here's the primary example: Michael tells the new temp Ryan to play along with a prank he intends to play on the receptionist Pam. Ryan, not yet aware of Michael's insanity, nods, and Michael calls for Pam.Pam walks into the manager's office, and Michael informs her that his choice in which employee to fire in their ongoing campaign of downsizing has been made simpler. Because she has been identified as an office supply thief of potentially thousands of dollars over 3 years of employment, she will not only be terminated, but will not even qualify for severance because of the punitive nature of her dismissal.Ryan shakes his head, non verbally disavowing any participation in the ""prank"" as Michael stifles a gleeful chortle. Pam, however, begins to frown and denies the accusation, claiming that she has not even stolen so much as a paper clip, but Michael casts her plea aside and tells her to clean out her workspace.Pam begins to cry profusely, a reaction Michael at ONLY THAT MOMENT realizes is a bad turn. He promptly cries, ""You've been 'punked'"" and laughs, sticking to his joke even as it careens into a deadly plummet. Pam calls him a jerk and runs off.In another episode, Michael makes small talk with Pam and mentions the common phrase, Thank God it's Friday, and that it's another day overworked and underpaid. Pam's only reaction is to say, ""I know what you mean,"" and Michael suddenly becomes stern. He says, ""if you are unhappy with your compensation, bring it up with HR.""Michael is clearly a character with huge flaws that all the other cast members have to tip toe around in order to get a solid day's work accomplished. None of the other characters exhibited signs of silliness, but as the seasons went on, the characters evolved their own various issues that, while making them unique, also made them all seem like cartoons. They stop tip toeing and begin bumbling around Michael Scott style.Jim and Pam's relationship was the other huge staple of the show. Just because they're married doesn't mean their ""adventure"" is over. I married my wife and it felt like life had only just BEGUN at that moment. Pam should have been able to make something of her art. When she failed, it felt like the show was saying, ""Just give it up, kids. You're going to stay mediocre regardless."" Jim's ambition to become a sports agent should have been much smaller, and he a lot more understanding of what he's putting his wife through. It's like nice, sweet, cool Jim has been replaced by Jack@ss Jim. If that's what we're left with, then none of his good moments, kind deeds, and hard choices have EVER mattered. He's just going to end up a douche eventually. NICE!",Jim and Pam DIVORCE? WTF?!?,1361750400,"02 25, 2013"

"Though this film has been negatively received as being a take off on the TAKEN films (father looking for daughter under dire circumstances) it is a different kind of film and one written and directed by Ruba Nadda who manages to gives us a story that in many ways explains why the Syrian situation (terrifying chaos) is as it is.  If for no other reason than to gain insight on what life in a country infested with many `secret police' organizations whose drive seems to be shoot now investigate later.Years after he left Damascus under suspicious circumstances (he was a accused of being an Israeli spy), Adib Abdel Kareem (udanese born British character actor Alexander Siddig) is comfortably at work in Toronto when he is confronted with devastating news: his eldest daughter, Muna (Jay Anstey), has gone missing in Damascus. Now Adib, who has not been back in over 30 years, must return to Syria and deal with his secret past in order to find her. Getting a Visa is the first near impossible step, but once in Jordan he calls upon his ex  fianc&eacute;e Fatima (Marisa Tomei) whom Adib deserted when he escaped to Canada years ago to jazzist him in ploughing through the red tape and dangers to find his daughter.  The Canadian ambjazzador Paul (Joshua Jackson) is inextricably involved as is Adib's old comrade Sayid (Oded Fehr) and the man with answers Halim (Saad Siddiqui). Inescapable is a thriller about a father's desperate search for his daughter and the chaos of the Middle East he left behind.The film is tense and disheveled at times but that reflects the worrisome chaos of too many factions trying to jazzist a country who seems unable to find its core values. This is not a great film but it does offer a taste of what life must be like in war torn Syria. And for that it is worth watching.  Grady Harp, March 13",Understanding Syria,1362960000,"03 11, 2013"

But then the gore starts. Not much but some. You get to see a dead man. You get to see dead woman who has been suffocated with a plastic bag and bludgeoned to death. You get to see another woman in a shower brutally murdered by another woman ramming her fist down the first woman's throat and all this blood pouring everywhere. So there is gore and weird music. Pretty much sums this movie up. I think it is an art flick trying to be cute with a simple morale message. But I don't know. They didn't quiet achieve that.

"this was supposed to be the uk answer to MAD MEN. it doesn't quite make it and i think the two major reasons it doesn't is that the writing isn't as good as MM's Matthew Weiner's and it doesn't have a charismatic lead such as MM's Jon Hamm as Don Draper. Ben Whishaw as the reporter Freddie in this show gives it his best shot and he is certainly the best role and actor in this series. But he is handicapped at every turn by a script which can't make up its mind what it wants to be: an espionage thriller or an exploration of uk broadcast journalism from its inception forward.  the espionage angle is definitely the weaker of the two angles and i would have omitted it totally.what i really did enjoy was seeing how another democratic nation handled the rights of the press when there is no first amendment as we have in the American Constitution.  The answer: very badly.  the UK government tried to intrude on the news at every point.  they actually shut off the broadcast and fired the producer when the show got too close to the problems in then PM's Anthony Eden's problematic rule. The reporters are constantly concerned about being considered treasonous whereas in the USA almost anything reporters might say or write about the government is protected speech.i also really enjoyed seeing charlie chaplin's granddaughter, Oona Chaplin, playing the conventional rich wife of the late 1950s to the anchorman.  she is very good as the UK version of MM's Betty Draper.all in all i enjoyed this show and i am going to watch series two.  it only lasted two seasons.  when it failed to materialize as UK's equivalent to MM, they cancelled it.",the Brit's experiment in bringing a Mad Men like show to tv,1385856000,"12 1, 2013"
"In the early `70's, the tawdry adult film industry discovered a new star.  Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) whose real name was Boreman had what was at the time, an unusual gift for fellatio.  This film attempts to provide some context as to how she became an icon of the porn industry.  To some degree the story comes from her own biography, ""Ordeal.""Linda was a somewhat nave teenager growing up in a strict religious family.  Her mother, Dorothy (an unrecognizable and excellent Sharon Stone) was particularly tough on Linda.  Perhaps that was due to the fact that Linda already had a baby which was put up for adoption.  While the film mentions the child, it is quickly glossed over.  Linda meets an older man who owns a cheapo disco club.  Chuck Traynor (played with remarkable sleaze by Peter Sarsgaard) has eyes for Linda and slowly builds up their relationship to the point that she trusts him with everything.  Next thing you know, they're married.Chuck has a number of low life connections including those involved in the porn industry.  At that time, much of it was controlled by the mob.  He convinces Linda that auditioning for an adult film would lead to legitimate acting gigs.  After a few head bobbing lessons from Chuck, he films her abilities and shows the film to a director (Hank Azaria) and producer mobster (Chris Noth).  She's in.  They make the film ""Deep Throat.""  By the standards of the time, the film was top shelf stuff.  With a decent budget, a modestly interesting script, some humor and of course Linda's deep throat, the film begins to draw in mainstream audiences.Chuck, by now is squandering money he doesn't have.  He's coked up most of the time and even rents out Linda to a handful of business men for their enjoyment.  This is disgusting stuff to be sure.  The film presents Linda as just a victim in all of this.  And certainly, based on her mother's warnings (""Just do what your husband wants you to do."") and Chuck's temper, is honest in some degree.  But Linda says that this is the only film she made and she only was in ""the business"" for 17 months.  I'm not sure that's true and I know there was more than one film she appeared in.The film can be shocking at times, but most of the explicit scenes aren't.  There are plenty of bare breasts but otherwise not much beyond suggestion.  The acting is very good, but the film left me cold.The Blu ray version comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  The film has a bit of softness to it which certainly isn't offensive and actually seems appropriate for the era.  There is also a fair amount of grain in the picture but again, no big deal.  The disc comes with a DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  The surround feature comes in primarily during the several party scenes and nights at the clubs.  Otherwise, this is a mostly dialog driven movie and comes in clear and concise.  There is only one extra called ""Behind Lovelace"" which is a 13 minute piece consisting of the cast and crew commenting on Linda.  Yawn...",(BLU RAY REVIEW) 2 1/2 stars for porn star bio-pic,1384905600,"11 20, 2013"
"Season 1 was Hot, a different legal show about child legal services.  The stories were true to life and heartbreaking.  Season 2 had a serious bad turn with the death of supporting actor Charles Whitfield, (James Mooney).  This was big mistake to remove James from the story line because he added the needed tension to keep the script grounded not to mention it removed the only Black attorney from the show.  When Mooney was removed the show became a romantic soap opera.  By the time Season 3 came around, Nick who everyone had waited to come to achieve the throne of the Fallin Law firm is again pushed down and then out of the firm all together.  His romantic life that the script teased on viewers totally failed and the character of Shannon the young girl in foster care with Burton Fallin slowly fades into the background. The last episode of Season 3 left me with a sad and depressed feeling because it seemed that not one person was able to overcome their emotional baggages.",Very good season 1 and 2,1373846400,"07 15, 2013"
"I find myself no longer watching any new shows until they are established   with one exception   Dollhouse, and you know how well that ended. We stumbled into Defying Gravity by mistake, since the networks refuse to advertise the truly brilliant pieces of work they unearth and, instead, push irrelevant nonsense they think the sheep will love. Dollhouse is an example of this   a show that had no advertisement behind it, started badly, but has ended with such spectacular brilliance, in my opinion, whether it is canceled or not, Joss Whedon has another win on his hands (and true Joss fans   where WERE YOU???). Defying Gravity was another wonderful nugget of sci fi that nobody watched. I am ordering it here and hoping it has some closure because it still drifts into my head occasionally and I wonder what happened to the amazing crew on their journey. The writing started out a bit slow, there were sluggish moments, but I'd put this show up against Lost any day for acting, suspense and intelligence. It's my opinion that Hollywood would rather keep it's head immersed in political nonsense (all L&O's, anything on NBC), or the blood and gore in the many CSIs and variations thereof, than give us what we want   intelligent Sci fi, or any program, where we can escape, and not be proselytized with their own beliefs. I'm turning more and more to shows offered up by USA, TNT, AMC, FX, HBO, SHO, and other cable networks, because they seem to ""get"" that people are getting sick of watching garbage get renewed, while the good stuff goes out with the trash. I won't even go into the now SYFY which is now giving us STARGATE Universe, a mere, horrible reflection of the brilliance of the original SG1 and Atlantis! Bring back Sci fi and maybe I'll come back! BIG mistake not giving Defying Gravity time to develop and grow. The networks are wondering why they are losing ground. It's no mystery to me and most ""regular"" folks.

"Everyone I've ever known swears and or cusses, but there's a time and place for everything, and I'm of the opinion that not ALL of our publicly elected officials swear.The zany antics of our legislatures isn't even funny, much less have an ounce of realism.  A lot of production personnel and audience members may be jaded in that they don't believe that the trust of public office is deserving of some reverence, but I do.If this was based on something substantiated, then yes, I might go for it.  But the premise of the show is that the representatives put on a show for show's sake, and everyone, even their constituents, are in on the gag.  If that's the case, then why bother with elections and this show at all?It's one thing to mock the political system, and it's one thing to throw up caricatures, but this goes well beyond that, and just trashes the whole thing with teenage humor for what used to be the adult time frame and career.I'm really sick and tired of these shows.

"It's hard to make a truly scary horror film these days. Nearly every aspect of the genre has been touched on at one time or another. To find something new, fresh and scary is almost impossible. And yet some directors have accomplished this. Some have simply gone back to recreate old scares or make sequels to other famous ones. And then there are those that remember what it was like to go to a video store, to see those clamshell or oversized boxes on the shelf with creepy images and titles. Some of those film makers have come together and unleashed a tribute of sort to those days called V H S.The film is comprised of several stories with a connecting story that is perhaps the weakest of them all. A group of trouble makers is hired to steal a VHS tape from a house they've been told is safe. Don't let the first minutes of this movie stop you from going on. It's nothing more than showing what idiots these guys are. When they get to the house they find a dead body in a chair upstairs sitting in front of a TV with nothing more than snow showing. Around the TV stand are a number of tapes. While several members go looking for a special tape, one stays behind to start going through these. As he watches, we're allowed to see what is on the tapes as well.The first story is one of my favorites. It shows three friends on a mission to help the geekiest one lose his virginity. They've rigged his gljazzes up with tiny cameras so he can capture the entire night on tape. At the local bar they hook up with two drunken girls but only one of these two goes back to their hotel with them. Also going back with them is a strange girl who keeps telling the geek ""I like you"". What happens when they get back must be seen rather than described and offers one of the real scary moments in the film.Another story follows a young couple traveling across country and filming as they go. Without noticing it appears someone is following them. When they awake to find someone in their motel room the horror is revealed.A third story has a group of friends going out for a picnic in the woods. Once there they tell the story of a group of friends that was murdered in those very same woods. Of course as with all these stories one has a camera and for some reason a glitch keeps distorting the picture. Each time it does a strange and horrifying figure appears.A fourth story involves a young woman who is chatting online to a friend found elsewhere. Their conversations have them talking back and forth and as is often the case, never realizing what is going on around them. When some scary figures turn up behind the girl as she talks, we get a chill as we wait to find out what happens.The final set piece involves a group of friends out and about sent to a house in the country. When they arrive they first find no one but after checking out the house they discover a secret ceremony going on in the attic. But just who is being killed and who needs saved isn't apparent from the start.Rounding out these stories is the main one with the search for the mysterious VHS tape going on. While each film here falls into the category of lost footage tapes, not all are truly scary and the connecting device falls short of being done as well as the separate stories. The first time I watched this I was honestly a bit bored and waiting for something to happen. The second time I enjoyed it more and took a bit more time to watch what was happening. As I said once you get past the first portion of the film it picks up speed.The one thing that did damage to this film was the hype surrounding it. Before it was released word was hitting the internet that this film was the scariest thing seen in years. Fan film fest were heaping praise on it and several of the directors involved had done some great films that came out prior to this one leaving expectations high. Each segment was done by a different director which would explain the look of each tape being different. Unfortunately each director did not live up to expectations.But there are enough scares here to keep you awake and enough memorable moments that might cause you to lose sleep if you think about them too much. You can't hold the look of the film against it since this is supposed to be a lost then found video and even taking that into consideration it does have a nice look to it for the most part.

"Not least because of Johannson's lovely person, but those are brief scenes. Seeing her floating in darkness or against the rugged Scottish terrain, seeing the face of her last victim and even her own face looking back at her and blinking, all contribute to intensity of imagery that's hard to beat. It supports the cryptic plot and dark ambience, where Scarjo forms the first link in the chain that abducts men (and only men) for purposes unknown. The mood develops throughout the film, as Scarjo's character seems to crumble from within.But, in the end, it's only mood, with barely a plot to point to and more left unresolved than not. This must be the most ambiguous SF film sinceThe Man Who Fell to Earth. Even that, to my eye, spoke in a clearer voice than this, and that movie is not known for clarity.Visually strong, but even that strength isn't enough to pull this one together.   wiredweird",Visually stunning,1398816000,"04 30, 2014"

"Basics   Bones, forensic investigator; Booth, FBI Agent, most everyone works at a place called the Jeffersonian institute, plan on murder(s), solving same and a decent amount of well played humor.On to the season review.First, I love the actors, or the portions of actors you see as people in the show.On the other hand the roles that they play can annoy the hell out of me.This season, there's turmoil as Bones and Co. wade through Pelant (Genius serial killer), held up marriage, misunderstandings.The character of Angie's jump to judgment just didn't ring true to me, and left a jarring &#34;WTF&#34; in my mind through several episodes.Pelant, the big baddie...  Boring, unbelievable (seriously inscribing fractal patterns on the ends of bones that somehow get read into a computer and cause a heat sensor in the server to blow?  To me, that jumped the shark in serious fashion.).  and to quote the character &#34;I'm wherever I need to be....&#34; (Well, something like that), he's able to have snuck in anywhere, hack anything, hook into pretty much any network that's out there, including and not limited to a kitchen alarm clock.Then there's the whole Geek sideshow mentality of the series, it's always been a part of the show and I've learned to live with it,  gross kills, jokes over decaying dead bodies.... but scenes of close ups of peeling faces off of skulls...  Nope, didn't really sign up for that either.And the penultimate one for this season, Higgins, Hodgens?  Angie's serf decides to grow an insect larva of some sort under his skin?!?  Oh yeah, that's quite appetizing.Almost stopped my subscription after that one.BUT, the plots haven't wholly sucked, the  acting isn't significantly worse than previous seasons (a lot of the characterizations are quite good and interactions entertaining).And they seem to be in process of righting the ship.  So, for now sticking with it.For me, it's reviewability of the thing, I'm un cabled, and Bones has been one of my go to's for watching re runs on past seasons.This one, I've had no inclination whatsoever to go back and watch again.

I liked the show because of the respect that the kids showed in helping their elders but some blanks needs to be filled in.

"TV shows always seem to be an all or nothing proposition in Amazon reviews. If someone watches a show, they automatically feel that it is five star quality despite its limitations. If someone tries a show and doesn't like it, they generally relegate it to a one star status despite its good points. Don't believe it? Go to the reviews of any program you absolutely hate and look at the glowing five star reviews from its fans. In truth, most shows fall somewhere in between  not every show you watch should automatically be considered as great entertainment and not every show you dislike merits a dismissive one star. I bring this up with NBC's short lived ""The Cape"" for one reason  I have only heard the show described as terrific or as terrible with very little middle ground. Personally, I think the show is neither terrific nor terrible but falls into the TV netherworld of a show with potential that never really fulfilled its promise.Capitalizing on the notion that every story with comic book origins deserves a Hollywood treatment (in itself, a specious idea), ""The Cape"" was introduced to capture the audience left when the increasingly problematic ""Heroes"" left the air. But lacking that show's complex mythology and appealing cast, it was an uphill battle from the start. I do contend that the elements to have developed a successful show were all present, they were just never jazzembled in the right way.The Good: David Lyons was a likable lead  a family man and cop who is forced into a heroic alter ego when framed (and seemingly murdered) by the town's super villain. James Frain has a nice menace as the unstable foe. Morally corrupt Keith David and a bevy of carnival performers provide unlikely support to our new hero. And sci fi stalwart Summer Glau is on hand as the altruistic, and completely underdeveloped, Orwell. And best of all  Vinnie Jones!The Bad: The show never loses interest in Lyons' wife and child. And, I'm sorry, they just aren't compelling characters. The show's momentum grinds to an absolute halt every time they appear. Excruciating.The Frustrating: I don't think the show ever determined what it wanted to do and is tonally all over the place. Veering from maudlin to comedic from one moment to the next does little to shore up the inconsistencies in the show. Frain, Glau, and David all have great potential  but none are given fully developed plot lines. There is simultaneously too much going on and not enough  there needed to be more focus on the elements that worked. There needed to be more emphasis on the bigger good versus evil concept as opposed to lesser stand alone episodes.With so many choices in this overcrowded genre, I don't know that ""The Cape"" rates particularly highly. But it is far from unwatchable and its cast is game. A show I wanted to like more than I did, it still boasts nice production values and a laugh or two  but never gelled to one cohesive vision.

"Season 1 of Leverage was pretty solid through and through, Season 2 began what I feel to be a hit and miss trend, and Season 3 continues what Season 2 started, both good and bad.Now, I love the show   even the episodes that I feel are not very strong are still fun and overall entertaining.  The episodes that ARE strong may be the strongest of the series, but unfortunately are not as plentiful as in previous seasons.  Missing more than other seasons is the slick ""flow"" that reminded me, in prior episodes, of a 42 minute Ocean's movie each week.It's still well written, funny, high tech and worth watching   it just feels like its slipped a bit from its previously high elevation.","Inconsistent, but still one of my favorites",1311984000,"07 30, 2011"

This season stinks. It is preachy with no punchline. It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5.

"""24"" is like Red Bull  once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of ""24"" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the jazzjazzination? It's a thrilling season  probably the best since the first season  and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched ""Casino Royale"" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like ""24"" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode ""prequel"" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th ""100 Episode Reel"" is a pretty useless extra    basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

"But I Did like the end where it points to alcohol as the gateway drug and that death rates for it and cigarettes nicotine.  Also liked the bunch about the pharmaceutical industry, however, prescription drugs are to be used as prescribed, and addicts don't obey doctor's orders.  It had its good points, but a lot of it was an annoying push for drug legalization.  While there are some bad cops out there, I get tired of them being portrayed as the bad guy by the criminals.  This was a documentary with stories told by criminals, that wouldn't be criminals if there weren't &#34;evil&#34; drug laws banning them.  The guys telling their stories were mostly dealers who got caught. Then we have Hollywood elite just because they are famous, and people listen to them.  I don't think kids should be able to get to watch this video, cause I doubt they would watch till the end.  They would just hear the part about easy money making and see the hot girls dancing in clubs, and see fun in the club.  And the way they start: &#34;I was in poverty, and I just wanted an easy way to make money, and drug selling was the answer&#34;.  Well the drugs that people abuse still have horrible effects on those who are addicts, their families, and the communities as well.  We already have alcohol and cigarettes, do we really need all the more dangerous ones legalized, too?  There has to be a better answer out there.  How about we just have communities out there where we can put all drug abusers together and they can have a big party and wreak their own havoc on each other.  Same for rapists and murderers.

"Other reviewers who have called this series 'Melrose Space' have labeled it exactly as I would. I wanted to like the show; the actors and set production on the space ship are really attractive to look at but...its an empty shell when your all finished with the show.

But these astronauts spend most of their time on earth pursuing the opposite sex and acting like stupid college kids when they go to the 'astronaut bar' every night after work. I'm just an 'average' sci fi fan so my view is when its good  like Battle Star Galactica, its good. And when its not  like Defying Gravity, its not. And one more thing, in sci fi above all else, you have to get the ""alien"" whatever that is or looks like, you have to get it 'right', it has to scare you or blow your mind in some way. And in Defying Gravity when we finally get to the 'alien', the threat to the crew, its a 'dud', its about as 'scary' as a piece of almond rocca candy, only in this case the candy is the most powerful thing in the Universe  yawn.

"I really like the TV show ""Dark Minds.""  It's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode, kind of like ""The X Files"" a long time ago, at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons.  I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly; I always get a really good chuckle when 13, or Raven, makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.I just read part of a review, written by Raven, of the show ""The Following.""  Now, for those of you who haven't seen ""Dark Minds,"" Raven is the pseudonym of the real life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions.  Raven is now behind bars, but he is allowed 15 minutes a call, to give an opinion on some unsolved crime.  Now, if anyone knows what he's talking about when it comes to serial killers, it would be Raven.  After all, practice makes perfect.  And evidently, he's had a lot of practice.  And I was very happy to see that Raven hates ""The Following"" nearly as much as I.I watched the first episode of ""The Following"" and only made it through the first half.  Raven turned it off after 40 minutes.  To me, the biggest problem with this faade of a serial killer show:  everyone is in constant crisis mode.  The real world doesn't work this way.  People have down time; they drink coffee every once in a while!  But watching Kevin Bacon    and his coworkers here    you'd think they're all on speed.  Man, I say:  kick it down a notch every once in a while!  There are other issues, but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.One issue that I had with Raven's analysis:  he said that serial killers don't engage the police.  Now, that is usually the case; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention.  However, what about killers such as Zodiac?  He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police.  But otherwise, I liked Ravens critique of ""The Following,"" a show that I won't be following at all, just like Raven.But I will be following ""Dark Minds.""  I guess the season ends this week.

"It's difficult to process Lars von Trier's &#34;Nymphomaniac Vol. I&#34; and it's not because it's impossible to comprehend. It mostly lies within the way the film is written, separated into two parts, and its tendency to focus on some of the vilest human beings on the entire planet.Before the knowledgeable yet naive Seligman (Stellan Skarsgard) discovers the beaten and unconscious Joe (Charlotte Gainsbourg) in the alleyway behind his home, &#34;Nymphomaniac Vol. I&#34; has a very slow opening that shows the beauty of falling snow and the innocence of trickling rainfall. The film then jumps into its first misuse of music as Rammstein suddenly explodes onto the film's soundtrack. Aside from the more orchestrated pieces, the music in both parts of &#34;Nymphomaniac&#34; is way too loud and nearly destroys whatever atmosphere the film had attempted to establish up to that point.Joe has been very sexual her entire life. In a nutshell, the &#34;Nymphomaniac&#34; films are a retelling of Joe's life as she narrates her story to Seligman; a man who has parallels to every nasty sexual act Joe partakes in yet never gets excited or mentions sex himself. The film is labeled as a drama and you really can't digest it as anything else since there's nothing comedic or horrific about it. It may be fairly adventurous but only as far as exposed genitalia or sexual acts are concerned.&#34;Nymphomaniac Vol. I&#34; isn't rated by the MPAA, but pushes the boundaries of what would otherwise be an NC 17 rating and is practically pornographic at times. The film shows a plethora of full frontal nudity of both sexes, plenty of graphic sex scenes, and oral sex on a train that is incredibly realistic and doesn't shy away from any explicit content. More complex visuals are shown at times involving mathematical equations, diagrams, and even a jigsaw puzzle.Joe brings up her father's (Christian Slater) influence that culminates with him deteriorating in a hospital bed while filling his surroundings with feces as Joe watches and has sex with every man in the hospital. She speaks of Jerome (Shia LaBeouf), which is the closest she's ever been to actually being in love and yet Jerome is verbally and physically abusive between egotistical spurts of self worth. Joe even mentions Mrs. H (Uma Thurman), a scorned wife who berates Joe in front of her three children for Joe's sexual choices and has an emotional breakdown right there on the spot.The film is mostly Joe trying to come to terms with who she is. She claims she isn't a good person and is just trying to fill a void that is incapable of ever getting enough. &#34;Nymphomaniac Vol. I&#34; is a fascinating spin on the perspective of an addict who has never gotten the proper treatment. Joe bitterly reflects back on her life with no remorse while Seligman's parallels about fishing add bizarre yet meaningful commentary. &#34;Nymphomaniac Vol. I&#34; strips sex of its romance and its intimacy and overloads the act with nothing but pure lust.",Sit back and take a load off,1398988800,"05 2, 2014"

It comes towards them and ... gasp!... it's the alien on the cover.  Everyone runs.  But Dad is &#34;abducted&#34;?  Son #1 gets the family into the car and races to a house they saw along the way.

It really does seem like this could be a decent movie, but aren't you sick and tired of having to watch jerky film movements that no one in their right mind would film if they were really being chased by ET?

Not a good sign for a situation comedy.The Cast:The Boys:Honestly, I have liked nothing that Seth Green has ever been in, sans when he played himself in ""Entourage"".  Giovanni Ribisi is likely wishing that he never cooperated with the criminal investigation in ""Boiler Room"". Peter Reigert was in ""Animal House"" in 1978 and ""Barbarians at the Gate"" in 1993.

I didn't watch the original TV program on Fox so I enjoyed watching the episodes on my Kindle. This is a well written and well acted drama. Facial and voice cues are used to determine if someone is lying. Cases involve a variety of situations so it is not repetitive. The mix of work and family in the show is enjoyable to watch. I would recommend Lie to Me to anyone who likes crime dramas. I realize that Fox cancelled Lie to Me due to low ratings.

"The low budget horror indie ""Almost Human"" is not a movie that should be oversold.  When I picked up the Blu ray with the requisite rave reviews (from Bloody Disgusting and Shock Til You Drop), I thought I might have found a small gem.  Truthfully, though, I think I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more discovering it on my own without preconceived notions.  This little movie borrows elements from a seventies slasher film and combines them with an alien abduction theme and throws in some cljazzic Body Snatcher moments for good effect.  The idea, itself, works terrifically well but I'm not sure the film was always as clever or as original as I might have hoped.  After an intriguing beginning, my interest in the movie really started to wane.  The body of the movie really lacks mystery or surprises, it's just a rampant killing spree (in which a larger dose of humor would have helped immeasurably).  It isn't until the final confrontations, though, that the movie truly came alive.  A couple of wacky moments (alien mating) really enliven matters and caused me to add an extra star to my rating.Slight Spoilers (but nothing that would surprise you if you read the Blu ray DVD cover):As I said, I quite liked how ""Almost Human"" began right in the thick of the action.  We meet Seth Hampton (Graham Skipper) as he is driving as if the devil himself is chasing him.  When he arrives at the home of his good friend Mark (Josh Ethier), he spins a harrowing tale of abduction and pursuit.  Before Mark can truly comprehend what's happening, electrical disturbances and a mysterious blue light come to visit.  And before you can say boo, Mark becomes one of the missing.  What happened?  If you expect a mystery to unfold, the screenplay takes us in an alternate direction.  Years fast forward, and Seth is haunted by what happened.  He starts to have strange premonitions about Mark and he tracks down Mark's old girlfriend (Venessa Leigh) to share his concerns.  Mark, meanwhile, has returned (in some form or another) and is making his way back home leaving an escalating body count in his wake.  All of this is so matter of fact.  The murders aren't a mystery, what happened to Mark is not really important, and the killing sequences lack imagination.End Slight Spoilers.I will say this, however, writer director Joe Begos clearly loves this genre of filmmaking.  You could sense his enthusiasm for the subject and how much respect he wanted to show it.  Therefore, when the final act rolls around, I'm pleased to say that the fun quotient goes up quite a bit.  When the three central characters square off, a number of moments made me laugh out loud.  It's fast paced and amusing, I just wish the rest of the movie had been so energetic.  This being a low budget endeavor, the effects aren't elaborate but they are effective enough.  And although none of the actors will win any awards (except maybe a diner waitress who is truly awful in her one line), they handle the action moments well.  I especially liked Skipper.  In the end, ""Almost Human"" is a pleasant enough experience with modest expectations.  It's not a new horror cljazzic, but it has a nice payoff in its ending.

"Grey's anatomy is certainly a big hitter in the world of medical dramas, arriving at its 10th season here.  That said, little has been updated about this series since day 1.  In season 10 we get the same impjazzioned speeches, the same character drama, etc.The one thing that has seems to have changed is that Grey's has moved further and further away from the actual medicine.  These days almost every episode is about the drama of the main characters themselves and their personal lives.  While that has always been a theme, it always took place within the greater backdrop of the hospital.  By the time we hit Season 10, the setting of the show almost doesn't matter.  These could be workers at a Starbucks and the basics of the show would be the same.The problem here is that so much drama has happened to these characters at this point that it is hard to feel any connection to them anymore.  There's hardly a doctor among them who hasn't been stabbed, shot, died, brought back to life, married, divorced, remarried, re divorced, sued, pregnant, leaving, returning, etc.  There's only so much that can happen to one character before you just become disconnected from the whole thing.If you're a fan of the series, season 10 is probably worth watching.

"[SPOILER ALERT] I really liked this film. Well, until the last 10 minutes. The end was flimsy and sort of a let down, which is why I'm giving it only 3 stars. It seemed...rushed, perhaps, or, that it was the only ending that could be crammed in the last few minutes. During the movie, the curmudgeon, Arlen, is likable. Not only that, but he dispenses fantastic wisdom throughout the movie (an indication, of course, that these are the things that the screenplay writer has been working out in his own head for years). But at the end, when Arlen tells everyone that he's never really talked to God, followed by a terse explanation that lacked any sort of sentiment at all, it made everyone feel foolish for believing in him, both the readers of his book, and the viewers of the movie. The thing about believing in God is that it's never what we think it is. God doesn't 'talk', but the things that we do, the magic that we create, the art, the beauty, that's God. We don't need a God to come down and give us an explanation of life in such a definitive way. Had Arlen said that he wrote the questions and then subsequently wrote the answers to those questions with the understanding that the arrival of the answers were indeed from a higher power, the magic of the movie (and the character) would have remained alive. As it is written, it's just a schmuck who doesn't believe in anything, not himself, not God, nothing except for a woman who lies to her son because she is too weak to face reality.It's hard to remain beholden to someone who's already sort of a jerk to begin with, then to realize that he's also a liar without a lot of faith in anything, well, that just makes us dislike him altogether. It would have been better if he told the truth and said that he thought that he had written those answers without the hand of God to guide him. But when he found love, then he realized that there was actually some Divine Power out there looking after him after all. In the spirit world, nothing is as we think it should be. That's what faith is. Faith is letting go of everything and trusting that your Higher Power will guide you, whether it's God, The Universe, your Ancestors, Buddha, Jesus, whatever. It never looks like we think it will, and the writer could have capitalized off of that. The writer should have given Arlen a profound revelation, or something that would have made the movie worthwhile. In the end, a very strong movie collapsed under the weight of an insouciant narcissist who wrote a book that he didn't even care about.I think that the writer should have kept the magic alive. He obviously wanted it to be a feel good movie or else there would never have been the love story. He obviously put a lot of effort into analyzing his own path. To discredit it by having his main character basically say that he's a liar and he has no excuse for it was sort of a cop out and rendered the movie uninteresting at the end. I was totally inspired all the way through the movie, cried a few times even, but at the end, I stopped believing in the wisdom of the movie just the way that the main character did. Too bad.

"Roadie (2011) tells the story of a man who returns to his hometown, after being unceremoniously fired from his job of twenty plus years, as a roadie for the rock band Blue Oyster Cult (BOC).  It's a poignant look at the past and the present, as pride prevents the rocker from telling the truth about his situation, to his mother, and those he grew up with.  While the characters might seem a bit clich&eacute;d and stereotyped, when put together they complement each other, and seem to belong to the same universe.  Familiarity with the music featured in the film is not essential, but adds greatly to its impact.Jimmy Testagross (Ron Eldard) arrives at his childhood home in Forrest Hills, New York, and instead of telling his mother (Lois Smith) that he has been fired, he claims to be the manager for Blue Oyster Cult, and is visiting before the band leaves on a tour of South America.  Jimmy repeatedly calls and leaves messages for someone named ""Bobby"", in connection with his situation, but never receives a return call.In a bar, Jimmy runs into Randy Stevens (Bobby Cannavale), a guy that tormented him in high school, who dredges up unpleasant memories, when he uses the nickname ""Jimmy Testicles"".  Randy now owns a car dealership, and his wife Nikki (Jill Hennessy), was once Jimmy's girlfriend.  Nikki sings and plays guitar, and is at the bar warming up for a performance that night.  Continuing the lie, the couple are suitably impressed by Jimmy's ""success"", as manager and contributing songwriter for BOC.With posters of Phil Lynott and Randy Rhodes on the wall, Jimmy and Nikki listen to the music of the Good Rats, as they reminisce in his bedroom, which has been preserved like a shine by Jimmy's mom.  Later Jimmy is picked up by Randy, and is taken to a motel, where Nikki is getting ready for her show.  Fueled by music, alcohol, and cocaine, what starts out as a fun time headbanging to BOC's ""See You In Black"", later turns ugly, as old demons resurface, and feelings are hurt.Directed and co written by Michael Cuesta (Homeland, Dexter), Roadie is a ""little"" movie that may not fully resonate with those who don't have the life experiences to appreciate some of its nuances, but most can relate to some of the basic themes being examined.  Jimmy's embarrjazzment is completely understandable, and his deception is like a sitcom clich&eacute;, where a boast or prank goes too far.  Peter on the Brady Bunch claiming to know Joe Namath, is just one of many examples.  In this case however, things feel more real, as matters don't play out as silly harmless fun, with several allusions to much darker possibilities.Ron Eldard (Sleepers) is perfect as a burned out rocker still trying to cling to the ways of his youth.  Waxing poetic on the significance of BOC, and the talents of guitarist Buck Dharma, Jimmy is truly in his element.  Still bitter that his father crushed his musical dreams, his success is largely dependent on the talent of others.Lois Smith (Twister,Five Easy Pieces) is spot on as Jimmy's mom, who still has the ability to transform the forty year old, into a little boy.  Many could play a loudmouth prick, but Bobby Cannavale does it with an authentic sense of New York style.  The talented and versatile Jill Hennessey (Law & Order,Crossing Jordan), is always a pleasure to watch.  Her musical talents bring great realism to Nikki, who is struggling with her own unrealized dreams.  Hennessy performs part of ""Ghost In My Head"", the title track from her 2009 album.While not completely original, Roadie largely works because it is thoughtfully written, and features some extremely talented actors.  Providing ample opportunities for reflection, this is a particularly interesting watch for those who have faced a midlife crisis, and is punctuated by a selection of music, which adds firmly to the film's impact.  Among the featured songs are Robin Trower's ""About To Begin"" and ""Long Misty Days"", Jethro Tull's haunting ""My God"", Blue Oyster Cult's ""Cites on Flame"", and perhaps most apropos, as it deals with the life of a roadie, ""The Load Out"", which is unfortunately not the original version performed by Jackson Browne.",jimmy t is back in the neighborhood...,1350172800,"10 14, 2012"

"While watching this movie, I was disappointed in places but I kept watching and was glad I did. I liked it much more after I thought about the plot and the underlying meaning.If you are looking for a fast paced film   look elsewhere because this one isn't it. Take This Waltz takes a long time to get going. At first, instead of building momentum, we are presented with a bunch of quirky characters (Sarah Silverman, for example) who seem to just wander aimlessly around in life. But once the main characters, played Michelle Williams, decides what she is going to do, the movie picks up and the pieces start to fall in place.I agree with some other reviewers that parts of the film are way too slow and that sometimes the characters seem unrealistic. But that is part of the beauty in the film. Some people do not have direction in their lives and because of that are drawn to whatever or whomever helps give them some excitement. Unfortunately, those same people often do not bother to think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late. As one lady says in the shower scene, ""new eventually gets old.""Now, Michelle Williams's character will annoy you to no end because she's always crying and is way too timid in her marriage. But Seth Rogen's character isn't without his flaws either.  And the actor who plays Daniel (Michelle Williams's admirer) is just as much a loser as the rest of them.I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price to view Take This Waltz, but if it's only $2 or so, it would be a good movie to have playing in the background as you clean your room or to watch while playing Scrabble.",It grows on you,1355788800,"12 18, 2012"

"I title this season (5) CASTLES AND QUEENS because I think the primary actor (Nathan Fillion) and actress (Stana Katic) are virtually king and queen of the murder, comedy, and melodrama serieson TV and I include BONES, THE MENTALIST along with CASTLE.  All 3 shows are excellent but seem to follow similar story lines.  I have all the episodes of the three shows on DVD or video libraries (from AMAZON of course!) and they all have their virtues and vices.  But Beckett is so charming and hot, one wonders why Castle took so long to get together with her.  It does seem  that all the women (Bones, Beckett and Lizbon) have walls built around them fearing to get to close to anyone.  They all have problems in their childhood perhaps that caused these walls to be built.In this season we have quite a variety of story lines, from Alexi being kidnapped (two part episode) to mocking STAR TREK, to romantic interludes, Castle being framed, and poking fun and horrorstories.  Like the other shows these five seasons has a great supporting cast (Ryan and Esposito) and a nasty female boss who for some odd reason wants to be addressed as ""sir"".  And like other showsthere are very obnoxious people, specifically Castles mother: arrogant, a moocher and a big spender (of Castles money).  She reminds me of that old hag in ""SUNSET STRIP"" who dreamt of making a comeback in movies: ""I'm ready for my closeup, Mr DeMille!""  She repels me like Dr Sweets in BONES, a lousy actor who doesn't know the first thing about psychology!But overall, an excellent, very entertaining series with superb acting, fine photography and gooey special effects.  I noticed the gooeyness seems to gotten more messy from the earlier series: influenced by BONES perhaps.  Some excellent aerial shots of Manhattan, though I live in NYC I haven't been to Manhattan in some years.

"This is the latest offering of another remake of Japanese horror films, a genre that was short lived because of its repetitive scenarios (young women haunted, pursued and jazzaulted by malefic entities) that led audiences to anticipate and predict the stories. This movie, released in 3D (why?) is a bad remake of the Japanese film by the same title, directed by Ataru Oikawa from a script by himself, Takamasa Sato and Kei Oishi, which was adapted from the latter's novel ""Ju On"". The Japanese version, far superior to this rendition, is itself heavily influenced by (if not plagiarized from) ""Dark Waters"", ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"".""Apartment 1303 3D"" is directed and produced by Michael Taverna, who also wrote the script, that has such memorable lines as """"Ugh, this apartment's freaking me out!"" and ""Apartments don't kill people. People kill people.""The story happens in modern day Detroit, where a naive young woman (Janet) rents an affordable apartment with a dazzling panoramic view, in an old building. Janet (Julianne Michelle) is trying to jazzert her independence from her domineering, abusive alcoholic mother (Rebecca DeMornay) and moves out of the family home, which she also shared with older sister Lara (Misha Barton).Weird people inhabit the building and the apartment is haunted by an angry ghost that eventually murders Janet, faking a suicide. Lara and her married cop boyfriend Mark (Cory Sevier), investigate the circumstances of Janet's death. No spoilers here.The story is hackneyed, lacks escalating suspense and is packed with inconsistencies; many questions are left unanswered, leading the viewer not to care about any of the two dimensional characters populating this fog. The direction is inept, the staging unimaginative and the acting is mostly clumsy. The special effects are incomplete and the few chills rely mainly on ambiguous frenzied violence and sound blasts.The ill conceived nod to Hitchcock's `Psycho' of a malevolent mother entity and a grisly shower scene; along with the strange inhabitants, ghostly apparitions, summoning voices, creepy noises and an ominous soundtrack cannot save this vapid, dull, droning concoction of clich&eacute;s. It would have fared better with a funnier dialogue, as a parody or clever spoof, lampooning bad horror movies.Fans of real estate thriller chillers should look up ""The Shining"", ""The Tenant"", ""The Fourth Floor"", ""1408"" or ""The Conjuring"" and give this turkey a wide berth.",Don't rent the apartment or this movie.,1382832000,"10 27, 2013"

"***SPOILER ALERTS***What starts out semi promising as a young man inherits his grandmothers luxurious apartment, he is being video blogged by some hot chick on the street. He basically dismisses her and requests not to be videoed. He moves into his place and strange things slowly happen. He starts to get suspicious that people are out to get him and basically oust him from the apartment, either because they feel it is wrongfully his or some other reason. He makes noises and disrupts the other tenants in the building, constantly challenging him to quiet down. The chick he met on the street, for whatever reason she felt she needed to see him again, finds her way to the apartment. He lets her and have a wonderful dinner and commence whatever relationship with some nighttime love session. She gets up in the middle of the night to video tape his apartment and all the things in it. Then, what we dont see, she gets jazzaulted somehow. What was it? A ghost? Another person? We dont know what happens to her.Our mild mannered tenant wakes up without really wondering what happened to her (or so it seemed). The whole ""who is there"" premise escalates to the level of paranoia as he traps himself in his apartment with handmade weapons and booby traps of his own making. He has like 12 days to establish himself as the official owner of the apartment and it took a matter of 12 days to become completely insane. Not sure that is likely, but that is what we have here. In the end, he is ultimately undone by his own boobytraps and dies by a wall of nails impaled upon himself.The epilogue: a small boy finds a laptop. Certainly, when we open anyone's laptop we go right to the incriminating videos. Right? Happens all the time. So this little boy is watching and we see the previous tenant dragging the body of the chick, apparently he killed. And this is done all spooky like with chopped up frames and blurred motion, because hi def video cameras on today's market for some reason are able to do that kind of thing. Which begs the question   is he a ghost or is it just done for effect? Probably the latter. Anyway, as he approaches closer to the camera, he turns to it and then does something that looks like he is attacking the camera. What?!? Why is he jazzaulting the camera?Anyway.

"We go to London for this latest creature feature based flick, where the contents of a secret military plane are scattered about the city. Despite the city being locked down some people totally oblivious to this fact enter a storage facility and become trapped (come on you were expecting a movie called ""Storage 24"" to NOT take place in a storage building?). At first things don't seem all bad but soon it becomes clear that there is something inside with them and it's on the prowl, that's really about it folks.The early part with the plane crashing and the aftermath that occured was actually pretty well done. Sadly after the decent opening portions it boils down to a run and hide flick, the people inside try to avoid this creature, which for the budget doesn't look horrible in short shots but the longer ones of it do show how goofy it looks. There's a lot and I mean a lot of ""Don't go in there"" or ""Don't separate"" moments with all involved, but of course for the sake of the movie they all do stupid things that lead to their demise.There's not a lot of scary parts, even the ones that involve the monster, in fact creepiest part was when one of the actors stumbles into a storage unit holding a bunch of creepy looking mannequins . I suppose the dark storage building was supposed to lend some good atmosphere to this typical plot, but there's a lot of uneeded drama and bickering between some of the key characters that bogs portions of the film down.Others have compared how bad ""Storage 24"" is with ""Skyline"", which I can understand but to me ""Skyline"" was much more irritating. ""Storage 24"" is a pretty basic and badly acted monster movie but nothing more, ""Skyline"" seemed like it was aiming for something more and even a possible sequel from how it ended. * out of 4 stars.","Excuse me sir, there's an alien in my storage unit.",1370044800,"06 1, 2013"
"For the most part, I enjoyed the first season of Lie to Me. Tim Roth is a fine actor, and very well cast as the protagonist, Dr. Lightman. He lends depth and intensity to a script that sometimes veers into the dangerous waters of daytime drama. The plots are uniformly interesting, and nicely paced.  The filming was crisp, and the directing was tight, which made up for the woeful mediocrity of the rest of the cast. (The one notable exception to an otherwise bland supporting cast being Mekhi Phifer who plays Agent Ben Reynolds.  But, you have to wait until the end of the first season for this much needed spice.)The real problem with Lie to Me is that, unlike Bones, there is very little science in the science. (And now I am going to speak as someone who has spent countless hours of doctoral research on cross cultural nonverbal communication.) While the main ideas behind the psycholinguistics of deception are correct, some of the ""data"" presented in this show are completely misleading.  Somehow the writers, whether in their ignorance of the subtleties of the field, or in the interest of presenting something palatable to a general TV audience, have missed the basic point of psycholinguistics, which is that nonverbal and paralinguistic modes of communication are shared by all members of a given society.  In other words, we are all ""naturals."" Reading subtle facial cues (""body language"") is a vital part of what keeps society going. In fact, individuals who cannot read these subtle cues are diagnosable as autistic. (Asberger's Syndrome is a form of autism in which the individual cannot read nonverbal emotional cues.) So, there really isn't any magic in reading nonverbal cues.The other side of that coin is that we cannot correctly interpret nonverbal cues if we are not members of that society.  While it is true that there are some universal expressions (fear, surprise), the vast majority of facial cues are culture specific. Lying falls into that category. If a Mayan Indian smiles, nods and says ""yes"" after being told the world will end in 2012, he or she is NOT agreeing with you, but he or she is also not lying. (Nodding, smiling and saying ""yes"" are merely signs of politeness. If you asked that same person if he or she had murdered someone after breakfast that morning, you would receive exactly the same response.) The only thing a psycholinguist can accurately judge is whether a person from a given society is displaying discomfort or anxiety.  The cause of that discomfort is unknown, of course, and does not mean that the person is lying. (Which is why polygraphs are so notoriously unreliable. Telling the truth can make a person even more uncomfortable than lying.) In that light, I found the constant refrain of ""You're lying!"" to be not only irritating, but highly inaccurate. (There are also quite a few factual errors which not only reveal a profound ignorance of the legal system on the part of the writers, but an unwillingness to do simple research, both of which are inexcusable in the age of the internet.)In spite of the reservations I have about this show, I still found it fun to watch Tim Roth, if not much else.","Excellent main character, somewhat flawed concept",1309996800,"07 7, 2011"

In making comedies and dramas, you don't have to make your characters sweet or likable as long as they are interesting or funny, and more importantly, believable, to sustain the film's running time. That does not happen in ""Bachelorette.""The characters are honest to the point of being totally nasty. That is fine, as being nasty is not mutually exclusive to being funny or even attractive. The problem is the story is not only unconvincing, but is uninteresting. Characters are not fleshed out. Drug sex related jokes are clich&eacute;d. There is some smart dialogue, and the talented cast gives their all, but sometimes it seems writer director Leslye Headland just doesn't know what she wants them to do.While watching the uneven mid part of the film, I expected these girls to raise much more hell.

"So many possibilities.  But this wasn't it.  Every single bit of this pilot was OVERTHETOP.  There were no sentences spoken   there were ""incredibly clever lines"" delivered at manic speed.

"Before deeming this review as unhelpful, I just want you to listen to what I have to say regarding this television program. And it is not COMPLETELY bad; it is more tolerable than a lot of the other stupid children's series out nowadays, so that is why I gave it an extra star. However, the humor is not the best.This is one of those programs featuring characters (particularly Otis more than anyone else) who are quite dim with bouts of cockiness and conceit that are very irritating. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but this series doesn't do a good job of portraying that in a funny way. And he does get his comeuppances frequently after having someone else top him, but often through predictable but ridiculous changes or circumstances or idiotic plot twists. The characters are either dimwitted, cocky, saucy, or all of the above either simultaneously or during certain situations, and in a way that is intended to tickle viewers' funny bones but is so dumb that it fails. Many characters are so moronically obnoxious that it's infuriating rather than entertaining. A shining example of one of these characters is Snotty Boy, who the writers try so hard to depict as obnoxious and bratty that they overdo it on his personality, and he comes off as so annoying and idiotic that it's really not that funny. That is the thing about this show: when they try to portray particular characters a certain way, they over dramatize the qualities that make them appear that way (i.e. charitable, sweet, feminine) to such a degree that it's just downright stupid rather than laughable, like how they're intending. (for example, a character with an overly  sweet personality would sound like this: ""I'll go pick flowers and frolic through the meadows riding on a unicorn's back"" in those exact words. No character has used those exact lines, I believe, but often very similar ones. It's supposed to be humorous, but it is so stupid that it is not). There's a good degree to over dramatize things and a bad one in comedy. If you go to the bad one, then it makes things seem stupid.Sorry that this review is so long. It is just difficult to describe what makes this program so moronic, in my opinion. If you are unfamiliar with the series and have not ever really seen an episode before, go online and watch a few for yourself and you'll see what I mean. It is tough to explain things without far too many exact quotations. And take the words of my review to heart while watching an episode, too. Then you will be able to understand things better.

"This show seemed like it had a lot of potential, but really fell short of my expectations. I thought Garry Tradeau might be able to put together a good story, but clearly his limits are confined to comic strips. The best part about the pilot was the Bill Murray cameo. Unfortunately, it doesn't sound like he will be a recurring character. The humor really fell flat, and seemed forced at times. Knowing Tradeau's comic strip, I was expecting him to take partisan shots at the GOP. It is really unoriginal, and an expected par for the course. It would have been interesting for him to think outside the box of his own political views, but that would require a much sharper mind. Also, Senators do not live like that in DC. Representatives will often times sleep in their offices in DC, but I have certainly never heard of a Senator rooming with three others. There is a serious lack of beltway and political knowledge on display in this show. Maybe ""Veep"" has set the bar too high for political comedies.

"I usually like Asian horror movies because they tend to have more suspense and less gore than American films. Unfortunately, the guardpost came up short on suspense.The first 45 mins or so were good since the film kept you guessing as to what the real issue was   ghosts, demons, virus, or just crazy soldiers. Once you find out what is causing the deaths, the best part is over. But unfortunately, the movie isn't. At about 2 hrs, there was just too much of the same stuff at the end. I knew how the film would end before it happened, though I was surprised at what took place with a few of the characters.This movie is great if you like long, drawn out conversations and don't mind getting confused with all of the flashbacks. There is some drama and a few scenes make you gasp, but there are not enough of them to make it worth spending 2hrs on this film.

"Zero stars if I could. Actually, NEGATIVE FIVE stars if I could.Wow. I can't believe how bad this film was. It actually became excruciating about halfway through. I had to force myself to keep watching it, so that I could write a review. This film should be taken down immediately, and all copies, draft materials, and anything else related to it should be destroyed. It cannot be salvaged. You'd be better off starting from scratch, than trying to save this film. This is one of the most detestable, deplorable, despicable movies I have ever seen that has tried to tout itself as a ""family film"". Good grief it was bad. How bad was it? The most morally admirable character was the VILLAIN, ""The Flamingo"", and he's obviously not that morally upright. I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer, but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality. The writers of this film seem to have no understanding, nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a cljazzical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right, and what is wrong. Superheroes often face moral dilemmas, but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices, no matter how hard it is to do what's right. Otherwise, they're superVILLAINS. Superpowers, super abilities, and super tech do not make superheroes. CHOICES make superheroes.Now let's examine the choices that this ""superhero"" family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to ""protect his family from a murderous mainframe"", when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house, he caves stating ""fine, just don't blow up my house"". So, finances trump family? Got it.Furthermore, the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the ""murderous mainframe"" once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor's house using a laser to trim hedges, rather than try to repair the damage, or make reparations, or even confess to it, he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone's parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to (in her own words) ""a dinner date"" at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker. All of the professional, married women that I know don't eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone, but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that ""The Flamingo"" is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown, the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead, at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard, the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard, even though he's at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone's spinal cord (but, hey, it's okay if you don't like the guy, right?) because he's ""protecting his family"". Evidently, trust for your spouse isn't requisite in protecting your family. (And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter's privacy by checking Facebook.)The father, rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife, destroys Richard's Corvette.The son, upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger's power gauntlets, and after destroying a neighbor's treehouse, rather than make reparations, or a confession, cuts and runs (perhaps taking a cue from his father's lack of moral compjazz).The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully (becoming the evil that he had resented and detested).The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain, doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the ""Hypno Spray"" to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter's school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter's boyfriend, then congratulates himself with ""THAT's how to parent!""The father uses the x ray goggles to cheat at the scratch off lottery, by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered, unconscious boyfriend on their porch, because they're busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife's dinner in the city, then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes. (Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat ""whenever things get hard"", but never realizes how hypocritical that is.)The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school, so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife. (Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular.) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity, but the show never addresses this. It also eventually leads to ""The Flamingo"" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been brewed, no thanks to our ""heroes"".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pjazz her driver's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it's the first time that he's bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city. The movie deems that to be a virtue. What happens to the superhero (or superspy) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others? That viewed the well being of society as higher than their own well being? Since when is selfishness a virtue? Disregard for others? Unwillingness to sacrifice?The family abandons a helpless, tied up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father ""realizes"" a bunch of things like ""heroes don't need masks"", but he doesn't actually realize anything meaningful. He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk, not someone who has been on a revelatory journey. It's trite, with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money. (Then the father laughably jazzerts at the end of the film that ""This city needs us"" even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film.)So how's ""The Flamingo"" the most morally upright? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions don't cause physical harm, almost to a laughable degree. On the other hand, the ""superhero"" family runs him over with a car, uses the ""Hypno Spray"" on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities, and when the ""Hypno Spray"" wears off, they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he doesn't trim their hedges. Nice. I'm so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life, and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power. (Please note the sarcasm. Please?)Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong, and that there are more important things in life than themselves. This isn't the case at all. It's the opposite. Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons, and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others. Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family (although, the same cannot be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family).The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable. The computer is right: they don't deserve access to the Grim Avenger's tech. They abuse it, and constantly put others in danger as a result. Their most dominant trait is family selfishness (they aren't necessarily selfish individually, but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world). They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action, no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world. If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy, this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy. This family is closer to a family of supervillains, then a family of superheroes. Like supervillains, they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics, and tone deafness, and is likely unsalvageable. Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap, or be honest, and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family.","DO NOT WATCH!!!

"...for loving, liking, or hating Californication.  If you've made it to Season 3, you've seen somewhat of an evolution in Hank Moody (emphasis on ""somewhat"") and the show itself, from a highly entertaining, ALWAYS well written but relatively shallow dissection of the California entertainment lifestyle (kind of a 40 something, high six figure Entourage) of Season 1 to a maturing, in his own reflective way, of Hank in Season 3.  You came for the gratuitous ribaldry, now stay for the reality of Hank's life choices setting in.Surely, many dislike Moody's antics and devil may care attitude about pretty much everything he interacts with, but the grounding principle of Californication is the sheen of LA tarnishes quickly when real love and family are at stake.  This is what I love about the show   it lures you in with its flash and fast living, but reminds you frequently that the lifestyle Hank lives isn't what ultimately makes him, or probably anyone, happy.He's the ultimate lithario, just good looking enough to inspire attraction and a high functioning wordsmith that almost always seals the deal for him.  As a guy watching the show, I would imagine most of us wish we could come up with, let alone manage to pull off, the verbage Hank Moody does seemingly every minute of every day.  Still, its a hedonistic existence that doesnt bring him joy except in the short term   but if Hank grew up, what would the show really be?To me, this is a writer's show about a writer, and while there is plenty of sex and occasional action and drama, its the flawless, yet believably effortless dialogue that keeps me coming back season after season.  I thought Season 3 began well and ended on a much higher level than any prior year, with Hank's sins finally catching up with him in a big, big way.  Would we all, on some level, like to behave like Hank Moody?  Season 3 reminds us that we're better off watching him from a safe distance in 1 2 hour episodes.

"The movie Dark Touch is rife with images of child abuse. There are bruises, bite marks on a baby's belly, kids are put in strangleholds, slapped, shaken. I know a lot of people might not be able to handle that who might be able to stomach a lot of other stuff in horror movies.My main issue with this movie is that it's not great. It feels slovenly, like maybe the team behind it thought they were creating the world's first Creepy Kid movie. Missy Keating makes a good Neve, the child who uses her powers of telekinesis and mind control to take revenge on all those who commit child abuse or seem like they do. She plays out an interesting evolution from an unwitting avenger to a girl who is in total control of what she does. But the adults she has to deal with are not particularly interesting (the exception is Charlotte Flyvholm, the elfin guidance counselor with the infectious giggle, but she really doesn't get anything interesting to do) and watching them go down just feels kind of weird. Something bad happened with the daughter of Neve's adoptive family (because Neve inadvertently kills her own parents at the start of the movie&#8212;with furniture! More on that soon!) Mary, supposedly a few years dead of cancer. In all her photographs Mary has bruises. There's definitely a story there, and it justifies the ending where Neve is putting out cigarettes on the skin of adoptive mother Nat (Marcella Plunkett). But maybe I'm just too dumb, it doesn't seem like we're ever told exactly what happened to Mary, and it seems that would have strengthened the movie a lot.If you get your jollies off of seeing people attacked by fast moving furniture, this is your film. Pinning adults against the wall with cabinets and chests of drawers (moving them WITH HER MIND!!!) is Neve's signature move. It never quite worked for me, especially not when a grown woman (Nat, I think) get's slammed into the wall by a flimsy card table laden with a child's birthday gifts.Probably pjazz on this one.",Beware fast moving furniture!,1405728000,"07 19, 2014"

"Although the documentary feature ""Room 237"" has received largely favorable notices from the mainstream media, there seems to be a disconnect with regular movie goers. I think that this breakdown comes in the form of expectations. ""Room 237"" is NOT about Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" Not really. If you are looking for a critique about that movie, this is NOT it. Rather this is a study of obsessiveness and the art of amateur film theory. Each of the unseen subjects interviewed for the film have rather outlandish ideas about the hidden context of the 1980 horror endeavor. These aren't meant to be accepted at face value by the viewer. Some are quite preposterous, some are huge stretches, and some merely contradict the facts when necessary. What we see is how closely people relate to certain films and artists. As society has been consumed by the entertainment industry, these commentators all think they know the precise meaning of Kubrick's text regardless of how far fetched it might appear to the rest of us. I, too, am a Kubrick scholar and have studied his work. But to dissect a movie in minute detail ascribing enormous significance to even the smallest bit of set dressing, it will boggle your mind!""Room 237,"" therefore, is about this obsessive act of movie mania and not about the source film itself. ""The Shining"" just serves as the catalyst to examine this bizarre phenomenon. I didn't learn anything about the movie, but was instead pulled into the compulsive theorizing of the film's participants. There are some interesting individual points, to be sure, and amusing speculation, but I was more amused than enlightened. Was the film a commentary on the Holocaust or to the annihilation of the American Indian or Kubrick's confession to his role in the staged lunar landing? These are just three of the ideas presented within the film, just so you have an idea of the film's content. The movie will not sway you to taking any of these propositions to heart, but it is fun seeing how these conclusions came into fruition for the respective spectators. To their minds, there is no question about Kubrick's intention and this single minded focus and left field read are fascinating to me as a film lover. I will confess, though, I did laugh at the theories with great frequency.The movie is constructed with film clips from ""The Shining,"" Kubrick's other films, and plenty of randomly selected moments from a variety of movies. We never see those that are postulating the bold new theories. Although I didn't believe anything at face value, I did appreciate the inconsistencies that were pointed out within the film. And some of these were probably intentional. Favorite clues: Danny on the hotel carpet playing with his trucks, his position changes as danger approaches. I also liked the mapping of the hotel as Danny drove his Big Wheel around. Biggest stretch: A ski poster is connected to a Minotaur? ""Room 237"" is an alternate look at obsessive fandom and, in that way, it succeeds greatly. No one is asking you to believe the far fetched ideas, but to embrace the impact that films can have on their subjects. I really liked this movie and was amused by it, but it might not be for everyone.

He has also done some great acting in movies and other series.  That said he can't save The Blacklist from being incredibly silly and unrealistic.  Rocky and Bullwinkle were involved in more realistic espionage operations.  Completely over the top.  I can suspend my disbelief quite a bit but not to the extent that the writers are asking me to.  Did they even do basic research on the operational mandate of the FBI?  LOL.  If in episode two, Spader wakes up in a pod wired up by the machine overlords to be a battery for their civilization and it turns out that the whole plot of the first show was just a dream to keep him under control I might continue watching.",I love James Spader in anything but even he can't overcome the terrible writing of this show.,1381104000,"10 7, 2013"

"The Bay is a message hidden within a film, similar to 2008's the Happening, The Bay tells of the consequences of destroying our environment. In this film, dumping into the Chesapeake Bay has caused a harmless fish parasite to evolve into a human killer. What makes this film unique is the way in which it was shot. The film is shot as a documentary that was posted on a fictional Wikileaks type site, and tells the story of the outbreak in a small Maryland town, on July 4th. The cinematography is made up of everything you'd see at a small town festival, camcorders, cell phone cameras, news footage, police dash cams, and security cameras. Through a collection of footage from the day, we are told the story of the outbreak by one of the only survivors, who had to let the world know of this tragedy that was covered up by the U.S. government. The different angles and the fact that their really weren't any main characters also make this film unique. The story really isn't much, as it just like a million other horror films. Everything is normal, until people start getting sick, and chaos ensues. It's not the story or even the actors that keep you interested in this film, it's the different pieces put together in documentary form by the narrator, Kether Donohue. Without the narration, it's just a collection of web clips, but there is some interest in finding out what happened to each of the people we see and in seeing them figure out what's going on at the same time that we do. It's not a great story and there aren't any stand out performances, but the film itself is done in such a unique way, that it will be like nothing you've ever seen before. Yes, The Bay is another way of telling us about the dangers of not caring for our environment, in a story that is severely lacking imagination, but it's worth seeing, simply from a stylistic point of view.",The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078,1377734400,"08 29, 2013"

"First of all, this is an Eli Roth film. If you don't know who he is, he's the man responsible forCabin Feverand the line ofHostelfilms, all of which are grim, violent movies. (Leader of the ""Splat Pack,"" some journalists have dubbed him.) CABIN FEVER I actually enjoyed, but only because it had a sense of humor about what it was doing, and you get the impression from some of Roth's other work (specifically some of his cameo appearances as well as his work with Tarantino) that he doesn't take himself too seriously. That's to his credit, because when your movie is an onslaught of relentless doom, gloom, and death, it helps to toss in a joke or two to help soften the blow or else you end up narrowing your audience down to masochists, suicidal goths, and aging serial killers who miss the good old days.This movie is about a random group of people in Chile who experience a mjazzive earthquake and then must deal with the horrific aftermath, including aftershocks, looting, crumbling buildings, and general anarchy. The movie is notable for refusing completely to follow any kind of traditional story conventions. I can't decide if they were trying to be avant garde or if they thought it would lend the story (as much as there is any kind of story) more impact, but a lot of choices left me scratching my head. For instance:   Nothing happens for thirty minutes. We meet three guys    Gringo is white and Ariel and Pollo are Spanish Latin American    who are partying hard down in South America. They party and talk about hit on girls and dance for about thirty minutes. There are a few stabs at character development (the white guy has a daughter; the fat guy has a rich daddy who's funding his fun; the skinny guy is obsessed with an ex girlfriend), but mostly nothing happens.   Approximately 60 70% of the dialogue is in Spanish, and at least in the version of the movie I watched, there were no subtitles. I actually looked around for a version with translations, but I couldn't find any. If you know Spanish, you'll get more of the movie than otherwise. It's not that hard to get the basic gist of what the Spanish speakers are saying (maybe this decision was meant to make non Spanish speaking viewers as disoriented as the foreigners in the film), but it is also off putting.   Protagonists? Forget about it. There seems like there could be, but ultimately isn't, any kind of lead character that you can hang your hopes on or root for. The film starts by following the three guys, but people join and leave the group intermittently as the disaster causes them to run for their lives. Maybe they thought that if audiences realized anyone could die at any moment then it would give the movie more tension and suspense, but what it really does is make it impossible to get too attached to anyone at all, making the chaos and killing even more mind numbing.Relentlessly nihilistic to its final frame, this movie is only entertaining if you enjoy watching people suffer for literally no reason at all. At least with the Hostel films (at least the first one), you could argue a point is being made about the corruption of power and wealth, and there's definitely a hero figure who satisfies even a splinter of the audience's empathy. This film, however, has no deeper message (other than that life sucks and then you die) and no satisfying level of personal engagement unless you have the heart of a barbarian and get your kicks from vicarious raping and slaughtering.I give the film points for most of its actors doing decent jobs (Roth's general aura of smugness implies that he's a much better actor than I think he is) and for also pulling off a lot of horrific stuff with an obviously small SFX budget, but the overall film is so brainlessly dark and despondent that it made me wonder how anyone with such a vision in their heads would also have the motivation to put it up on the silver screen. Seems to me anyone with this kind of outlook on life would be more compelled to take a bath with a toaster than actually write a script about it. Movies are usually made to a) tell an interesting story, b) entertain, or c) teach lessons about life. This movie doesn't do any of those things unless you think the cold, tarry abyss of your waiting grave is a) intriguing, b) enjoyable, or c) a profound morality play. If you do, congratulations, you're among this film's target audience and should enjoy it.

"We are all familiar with the Law & Order SUV formula.  It has been rigid from day one.  We start with the sex crime being committed, then with the detectives working on it, to its being kicked over to the prosecutor for trial.  This is  often the show's strength but also its weakness.  We know the formula so well that we're getting inured to it.  I can consult my watch to see exactly where we should be in each show.  I don't think there is much that can be done about this.  Every show has a finite life span and the most any seem to eke out is ten or eleven seasons.  And those are the very best shows ever!  So I suspect that we are nearing the end with this series.  I still enjoy the detectives and their cases and I think the actors do a fine job.  I would not replace anyone who is on the show. However, week after week with the same formula cannot help but get a bit tedious after ten years, especially with so many fresh and new series coming to the fore which are less formulaic.

"My initial review was favorable (it's below this new post) and hope full, however, the special interests are going to ruin it for me. It seems each new series MUST have the following stereotypes, or it doesn't get made:1. A strong intelligent black man. It doesn't matter if it is appropriate to the story, they MUST be there. In this case, Renfield is a large educated black man.2. A strong independant woman. It doesn't matter, again, if it is appropriate to the times or story, this character must be there. It's even better if she is black too. Here, we have a female physician.3. The sweet, misunderstood, gay. The following rules again apply regardless to the story or the time. This character is wise and is always kind and sympathy inducing.Now, understand, I am not speaking against these groups. It's just that forcing them into every darn show takes away from the time the ACTUAL STORY could be told. I would love to just see Dracula, Van Helsing, etc. battle the bad guys. Instead, time is taken to develop these stereotypes, time taken away from the tale. The special interests are ruining so many shows, trying to sway your opinions. It just pisses me off, lol. I don't like pointless sex of any kind in the story either, straight or gay.As far as gays, I don't care if you're gay. I don't care what you do behind closed doors in the privacy of your own whatever. I don't mind at all. I do, however, mind if your in my living room trying to tell my kids that ""gay is OK"". Kids have a hard enough time without these issues, and it CONFUSES THEM. I'm sure I will be blasted by people who neither fully read or try to understand what I am saying. The ones that just do knee jerk reactions to the mere mention of the issues. Ah well.++There is almost no subject quite as ""done to death"" as Dracula and vampires.

"""Ong Bak 2"" is a very misleading title. The film stars Tony Jaa of ""Ong Bak: Muay Thai Warrior,"" but ""Ong Bak 2"" is not a sequel. ""Ong Bak 2"" follows a totally different story with different characters and is set in different time. (Perhaps the only element that these two films have in common is a huge statue.) But be jazzured, Tony Jaa remains the same, as powerful and strong as ever, though you may not like some part of his new film, as I will explain later.Set in the 15th century Thailand, ""Ong Bak 2"" follows the story of Tien, a courageous young boy caught by a slave trader. Young Tien is in fact a prince whose parents have been murdered by a traitor. To survive and get revenge, he joins a group of bandits ""Garuda's Wing"" led by Chernang (Sorapong Chatree) and learns various fighting skills among them. After hard training, grown up Tien (Tony Jaa) is appointed as commander of the group.Tony Jaa's martial arts actions themselves are as amazing as ever, something that will never disappoint. For the new film Tony Jaa employs a wide variety of martial arts styles, plus many kinds of unique weapons such as nunchucks. Though some fight scenes are slightly repetitious, they remain thrilling throughout. Dan Chupong (""Born to Fight"") briefly appears as ""Crow Ghost"" and they provide an impressive battle scene at the climax. As to the acting, well, Tony Jaa is OK (a little too intense at times) and Sorapong Chatree steals every scene he is in.What is really regrettable is that the film considerably changed its narrative style from the original ""Ong Bak,"" in which a simple storyline really worked. Though ""Ong Bak 2"" (co directed by Tony Jaa, later with Panna Rittikrai, Jaa's mentor and choreographer for the first ""Ong Bak"" and ""The Protector"") has a lot of thrilling hard hitting actions and incredible stunts (one involving running elephants), its revenge story, which should be simple and straightforward, is a bit too complicated and serious with a twist which I think is unnecessary. Also, the film ends rather abruptly, which is disappointing, but maybe I should wait for the next ""Ong Bak"" film.Obviously ""Ong Bak 2"" has better production designs and costumes than the first installment, but what we really need is Tony Jaa and his actions.

"I watched Helen Mirren in every episode of this show when it first aired on BBC in the UK.  She was absolutely magnificent in the role.  I suspect how much you like this show will depend on whether you saw the original series starring Mirren. I can't say this is a terrible version of the series.  However, the whole thing turns on the lead actress and her desire to climb to the absolute top of the homicide heap.  I didn't think this actress had the same ability as Mirren with this character.I also wonder about such blatant sexism being practiced by the NYPD with the USA's EEO laws.  The entire first episode is a flagrant violation of those laws and we learn in seconds that this is just one series in a long episode of her cases being handed over to the men in the office.  The USA is so much more litigious than the Brits that I simply can't believe she isn't seeing a lawyer and shortly receiving  a hefty settlement along with any homicide case she wants to handle.","If You've Seen Helen Mirren Do The Role, this is a Hard Sell",1317427200,"10 1, 2011"
"If you are desperate for a good end of the world movie, you're out of luck with this one. It's not even close. Oh, the producers tried...they tried very hard to give us everything. Every cliche, every stereotype, even every scene from every other TEOTWAWKI movie.Let's see. Band of hardy survivors. Yep. Wrongfully convicted yet innocent black man who we know will be the heroic leader? Got it. Sexy woman who wields a gun the size of a lacrosse bat and says ""Ah em trenned an' deddly"" in what might be a French accent? You bet.  Hooker with a heart of gold? Present and accounted for. Rich and spoiled society dame?  Drunken Irishman? Check and check. Gay guy in a clown suit? Okay, that was a new one one me. You don't see many of those. Probably struck the writers as quirky. We also have a lady policeman who is an imbecile and a lawyer who is there to take up space. Think Maryanne or Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island. They did slip up a bit with the characters. The Irish guy is the villain, and like all lousy tv show villains, he has no qualities other than being mean.  Sorry, but this is not in the stereotype playbook. A cliche Irishmen should be happy, with a twinkle in his eye, talkin' o' the leprechauns and the auld pub back in Galaway. It's the lawyer who's supposed to be the jerk.The adventure begins with our little troop getting stuck on an elevator. Almost 15 seconds elapse before they all panic, faint, go into semi comas, and fight among themselves. Another a grueling moment goes by before they manage to open the doors and escape. This is where things go downhill. For them and for us. Mostly us. Now they are trapped on the building's parking level. Oy, already. The horror. The mesh security gate is shut and there they are starving and thirsty (yeah, it's been fifteen minutes, but back off), succumbing to mysterious illnesses and being attacked for no apparent reason by armed escaped convicts. And despite all this drama, the mesh fence shows no sympathy and stays shut.  They slap it with their hands. They shake it. It doesn't budge.  Hello, this is a parking a garage. Cars? Jacks? Tire Irons?  Fortunately for them, the handsome wrongly convicted convict shows his leader credentials early, escapes, comes back like the hero he is, and saves them and now they're free. So what do they do? Get in their cars and go home like normal people.  Don't be silly. They all pile into a vacant ambulance and head toward the Rich Lady's house.Several adventures ensue. We get to see mob scenes that are comfortably familiar to anyone who has seen 'Walking Dead,' any remake of 'War of the Worlds,' or one of those Aliens Have Landed and They are Ugly and Have Issues epics. People run this way and that way, stuff explodes for no reason people push, shove, and trample one another, kids cry out for mommy. Helicopters randomly crash into one another. There are no phones, no power. Gangs are on the prowl. And just when you think our Survivors have seen the worst,gone through every syllable of recycled B movie dialogue and every bad script retread, they go and spring The Big One us.  This is not just some Grid is Down Bomb Has Fallen Martians Are Eating Bakersfield adventure. It's multifaceted and complex. Boy howdy.  Get this. The survivors discover they all have the same birthday. What a twist! Why, this could be a discarded moment from ""Lost.""And then, without even hardly giving us time to recover from that shockeroo...we get The Monster. One smooth glide from ""Lost"" to ""Lost in Space."" It's not much of a monster. just a skinny guy with gray body paint and bulging red eyeballs. A sort of unwrapped mummy who didn't get much sleep. But don't snicker. He's scarier than the hairy rocks that used to chase Will Robinson and the Robot. But not much. And The Monster does manage to do an upside down backwards scuttle on all fours that has only been used only in about five or six movies since we first saw it in the Director's Cut of 'The Exorcist' about a decade or so ago. Anyway, that's how it ends. We are left wondering if this is a monster? Demon? Creature from the Planet 9 without his gorilla suit?  Or just a naked guy with dry skin and a hangover. Incidentally, although he appears to be nekkid as a mutant jaybird, he's pretty much Ken doll if you know what I mean.I wish the pilot was better. I wish we had a great new show awaiting us. This one isn't in the ballpark.  I'm giving it three stars because there is no sick little girl who needs special medicine and no lovable little puppy in imminent danger.

"I have to agree with reviewer Neil Bergman where he states; &#34;It's a combination of Nazi concentration camps and the French underground resistance from WWII.&#34; The series is getting well to the point that it is no longer believable sci fi, which is the kind that I like most. If you replace the enemies here with Nazis, etc., it might as well pjazz as a WWII drama. At this point, there are too many subplots to follow, and to me, the whole youth Nazi camp brain washing thing is a bit much for me. I will give it a couple of more episodes, but I am quickly loosing interest.Since I no longer have cable, I have to pay for it here on Amazon Prime Video since Hulu+ does not carry it, or wait a while and watch it on TNT's website with ads.

"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW.This is based on a true story: Connie Stevens once read a Steinbeck novel. The beginning of the film introduces Carrie, a 10 year old girl (Rylee Fansler) whose function is to supply some needless narration. She is not a major character in the film and I kept wondering how she was going to fit into the scope of things with Grace (Tatum O'Neal).Landy (Michael Biehn) has the patience of a saint as he takes in Carrie and decides now would be a good time to get his &#34;crazy&#34; sister to come home against the wishes of the asylum. Grace causes issues, not unlike a Steinbeck novel we all know and love. The film introduces religion into the film which didn't seem to have a point, as did the film itself.The film was long and slow. It was like watching the rain come down...which we did. The adult performances were spectacular. Michael Biehn was  unrecognizable from his normal &#34;B' acting role. Tatum was Oscar worthy consideration. The girls left something to be desired. Too bad Dakota Fanning had to grow up.Overall, this was a tiresome film by Connie Stevens, who I enjoy more in front of the camera than behind.No F bombs or nudity.

They are things that liberals think are conservative or things that liberals wish conservatives believed in. I like the show's characters, but I hate the politics of this show. If this keeps up, I am dropping the show from my watch list. My advice to Amazon: create a liberal bashing show which would be a hit since there is NOTHING like that out there in the mainstream entertainment media.

"I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original ""Texas Chain Saw Mjazzacre"" and ""Poltergeist"" but this episode does not live up to his reputation.  The story is blurry, unoriginal and not scary at all. It is a tale that has been told many times before.  An angry demon of the earth, this time oil under the earth, enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother.  Now years later it's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in. The story has no real clarity, and there is a no suspense or thrills just mjazz confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer.  It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute.

"For a film with so much buzz, especially for its director and his bag of tricks, `Monsters' is disturbingly ineffective.  I should have listened to my Ammy buddy MKIA, but then again, even he said I may like this.  I wanted to.  While heavily clich&eacute;d, I just wanted this to scare the pants off of me, and we all know that atmosphere is the scariest thing of all; and this film supposedly had a lot of that.It doesn't.Okay, so the film takes place at a time when alien life forms are terrorizing humans.  These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border.  A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States (that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer's boss).  Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters; the film itself had major promise.  I mean, I'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial.  The script itself, while heavily clich&eacute;d, could have really proven deeply arresting, and the final scene is expertly handled (and by final scene I mean just that; the split second before the credits begin to roll).  Still, there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able.  These two actors are atrocious.  I mean, they probably put in the worst performances of the year; period.  There is no chemistry, and the dialog they have to suffer through is horrendous.  I know that this film was done on a small budget, which actually says a lot for the crispness of the scenes (the cinematography is especially marvelous) but you can feel an air of `cheapness' in a lot of the voice over work (I don't know if the sound wasn't good on the original shoot and so they basically dubbed all the dialog, but there are many scenes where the crispness of the vocals is distracting and phony sounding).The `scary' moments are few and far in between, but they are effective to a degree.  The opening scene is pretty great and got my hopes up very high, but in the end `Monsters' barely registers with the viewer save for some beautiful cinematic shots and a shivery score.",`Boo'mbs...,1306195200,"05 24, 2011"
"Sometimes with Samuel L. Jackson you get him playing a hero or a villain and honestly he's good at both. He did a good job playing his character in this one as an evil eyed killer that murdered people ""just because"". His role in the film is one of the movies more redeeming qualities as I don't believe it would have worked so well with a different actor. These ""I met a stranger"" type of movies really require just the right person with the right bits of crazy. The only other movie I think that pulled it off nicely was ""Blood River"" but that's a whole different league.Meeting Evil is the story of a man who's down on his luck with his job,his life, and his marriage. Everything that can go wrong did go wrong for him. He's just a good guy trying to hold on to whatever positive he has left. What is unraveled in this movie is a much deeper personal look into John's problems. The first of which starts as soon as he foolishly tries to lend a helping hand to a stranger that knocks on his door. Samuel Jackson plays ""Richie"" a sadistic killer that's capable of doing anything and everything. John is at first very naive to all of this until he finally buts it all together for himself and finds himself caught in an even deeper mess than he ever imagined.What makes meeting evil good is that it brings up some interesting plot points and what makes it bad is that it never builds on them at all. It just sort of shows you one thing like Johns relationship with his female co worker and then it never comes back to it. It's sort of just left there when for the first half of the movie you're basically watching the chemistry between the two characters. That's just how ""Meeting Evil"" plays out. Good ideas that never seem to wrap themselves up. The ending to the film is a prime example of that as for the type of movie this is, it's the type where a solid ending is needed but this one likes to leave on an open note.For those reasons I didn't enjoy Meeting Evil much. The majority of the show is watching people being senselessly murders (although it's portrayed very well adding mystery and allure to how Richie works)but the movie never seems to have any uplifting moments or any point to it. It's very dark and leaves you feeling kind of in a hopeless place watching the killer roam free and John dragged into it. There really aren't any heroes in this movie just victims. There's no one to cheer for and Samuel Jackson with make you hate him by the time the final scenes come up. He just completely Evil in this movie and maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it so much. Usually when Samuel Jackson plays a villain he has some trait that makes him likeable but, in this movie he is just sadistically evil.Without spoiling the movie which is easy to do as there are few twists in the shallow story, you really are just watching a movie about a pathetic man whose life turns upside down thanks to not only the killer that bumps into his life but the people that the man trusts as well turn out not to be on his side either.Overall I give the movie about a 2.5 out of 5. I didn't enjoy watching it but, that doesn't mean it's a bad movie. I can see others watching it and enjoy it as it does have it's good points but for me personally it's just not my taste.",Just not my style...,1354579200,"12 4, 2012"

"'The Canyons' is one of those films you hear about, that is so bad that you have to see for yourself. Plus, it was supposed to be the comeback of Lindsay Lohan. What I kept thinking when I saw Lindsay Lohan was the amount of bruises on her legs that were apparently not covered by make up. It was sloppy, and that is exactly what the film is, sloppy.What we see is the underbelly of Hollywood. The scummy, seamy side. A young, would be starlet, Lindsay Lohan, being kept by a millionaire porn star. Sex with differing couples, or with men whom the porn star has promised a night with Lohan. The plot is thick with wanna be's and with actors working as waiters and bar tenders, selling and playing with sex and drugs on the side. Everyone seems to be a little 'off' is it the drugs or are they all mentally ill? No matter, thus is not a good film. I am not sure if it ever made it to the big screen.

I feel that the director has failed to capture the true personalities of the cast.

"I'll start by saying I found Grave Encounters to be boring with no scare factor at all. Actually, I don't get scared during movies, so let me correct that by saying the first one was pretty boring with no cool or fun scenes. However, some people loved it and thought it was pretty scary. I have to wonder if they watch scary movies enough to know what a decent horror flick is really like? After all, so many fans of the wrong genres flocked to Cabin In The Woods and claimed it was the scariest movie they had ever seen... pffftt, try watching Moonwalker next time.The intro of this movie shows a bunch of reviews to the first movie, where alot of people said not enough happened in it, which is something I agreed with. So this one here has gone all out to try and provide something happening every few minutes and not just bore you to death with people in the dark with flashlights afraid of their own reflections. The plot to this one is about a filmmaker kid who found the first movie pretty boring, until he does some investigating and wonders if it was a movie at all, or if it was real? He receives messages on his computer from someone called ""Death Awaits"" and gives him coordinates on where the run down asylum really is. After a boring 30 40 minutes of him and his dumb friends partying and looking for evidence, smoking bongs and getting drunk, the movie finally get's better about 5 minutes into when they arrive and break into the hospital at night to investigate what happened to the original cast from the first movie.Once inside, the group begin to experience the same sort of things as the group of the first movie, only it looks better, happens more often, and doesn't let silence and nothing overshadow the plot. In other words, it's a much faster paced film. So the first 30 40 mins are a bore, the middle is OK, but the end... once again it has an ending that doesn't really pay off as a great ending. Is it really the best they could come up with? Oh well, I guess we will be seeing GE3 soon then.Personally I liked it a lot better than the first. However, if long drawn out boredom and noises are your thing, you might prefer the first.","50/50.. some hate it, some like it.",1372377600,"06 28, 2013"

"Dark, gripping and unique!Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White, a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family. His wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. (RJ Mitte) is physically challenged.  The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs.  He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students (who have no care in chemistry) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it.  To make matters worse, Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money, he doesn't tell his family about it.  In fact, he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life, this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it, he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family (with their friends).  He watches his sister in law Marie's boyfriend Hank (Dean Norris) is a DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful. Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter's weakness, he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride along as they go after drug dealers.  But what catches Walter's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So, Walter decides one day to take on Hank's offer to  go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust.  He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth, how it's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products.  With basic chemistry, he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So, during the bust, he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust.  Walter goes to Jesse's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him.  He'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration, both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other.  But because Walter's crystal meth is perfect, Jesse's distributor want to know who's cooking it.  Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them. In trouble, Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal, both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse's home.Walter goes from a ho hum life to a criminal life involving drugs, theft and murder.  And because he needs money badly, he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers.  Meanwhile, his sister in law's DEA boyfriend is on the hunt for the person creating the perfect crystal meth.The first season of ""BREAKING BAD"" features a total of seven episodes.  Three discs are included.  Three episodes with an episode commentary and deleted scenes on each disc.  The third disc features the final episode and even more special features.VIDEO & AUDIO:""BREAKING BAD"" is featured in 1:78:1 Anamorphic Widescreen.  The video quality is similar to a lot of dramas that are on DVD but because of the many outdoor scenes, the quality of the film is pretty good.  Not flooded with grain.As for the audio, the audio is English 5.1 (Dolby Digital).  The audio is primarily dialogue with no need for special effects or rear channel usage.  There is music that come strong through your speakers but overall, this is a dialogue driven TV series.  There are a few action sequences in the series but they are limited to a few episodes.SPECIAL FEATURES:There are quite a few special features included on all three discs of ""BREAKING BAD"".DISC 1: Audio commentary on the pilot episode by creator and cast including Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.  Plus deleted scenes.DISC 2: Audio commentary on episode 6 ""Crazy Handful of Nothin'"" by creator and cast including Vince Gilligan and Bryan Cranston.  Plus deleted scenes.DISC 3: There are a good number of special features on the third disc such as:* Making of ""Breaking Bad""   An 11 minute featurette featuring the behind the scenes filming.  Enjoyable and showing the wit of Cranston and the cast joking of how Cranston likes to be pants less.  Interview with the cast and crew.  And the cast talking about creator writer Vince Gilligan is such a gentleman and so nice but his screenwriting for ""Breaking Bad"" is dark, shocking and twisted.* Inside ""Breaking Bad""   A 30 minute featurette featuring interviews with Vince Gilligan and the cast.  Especially the gory scene in episode 2 as acid is used to rid of a body and how they made the body parts.  This featurette includes interview with the cast.

Discussions of television series versus films and more.  An intelligent discussion among professionals.* Screen Tests   The actual screen tests for Aaron Paul, Anna Gunn, Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris.* Breaking Bad on AMC   The AMC commercial for ""Breaking Bad""JUDGMENT CALL:What an excellent series ""BREAKING BAD"" turned out to be.  I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston (who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ""BREAKING BAD"") in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact, it's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with ""BREAKING BAD"" is that it's a series that is well written, smart but dark, shocking and even disturbing at times.  And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White, a loving wife, mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers.  In one scene, she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene, the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse.  Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family, you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position.  Having to work with unstable drug dealers, watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs, it's a series that shows the seedy, dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy.  I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself.  Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall, ""BREAKING BAD"" is a unique, well written and well acted television series.  Surprisingly, AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series (the other is ""MADMEN"") is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go.  The first season for ""BREAKING BAD"" really was surprising, entertaining and unique.  I was very impressed and looking back, I'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season.  ""BREAKING BAD   THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON"" is definitely recommended!","Dark, gripping and unique!  Well-written, well-acted!  Definitely worth watching!",1235001600,"02 19, 2009"
"To me, this episode seems to take everything wrong with Fringe and pack it into one, plodding, tedious and at times, deeply annoying script.  Walter Bishop is at his most annoying and boring.  Peter and Olivia are weak and ineffective. The big reveal takes so long and, really, in the end, so little is revealed, you just want it to be over.  With respect to Walter Bishop's acid trip?  Trust me, there is nothing more boring than someone else's acid trip. Walter's acid trip is no exception. I think Disney should sue them for using a very recognizably disneyesque animated fairy. And then there's the Monte Python animation sequence.Aimless, drawn out plot developments. Everything that usually makes a Fringe episode exciting or interesting is eliminated. It's claustrophobic. Absolutely minimal forward plot movement. Forgettable dialogue. No suspense.  One scene of pointless and unconvincing violence. Utter absence of interesting supportive characters. Rehash upon rehash. No new ideas   zero. Utter lack of wit or humor. And on and on. And the director seems to take delight in sapping whatever life there is in this sorry script with excruciatingly slow pacing.  Everything that can be wrong with a TV episode is wrong with this one. It's enough to make you dread the next episode.  Right now, it looks like the season is going nowhere.

"Area 407 is the latest fear filled film from IFC. This low budget, found footage story begins with two sisters boarding a plane from New York to Los Angels. As they do, we are introduced to several of the other pjazzengers who inevitably become mainstays throughout the film. The plane finds it's way into some rough turbulence and with some smooth editing, the flight comes to an abrupt end. The pjazzengers must then work together to try and survive the crash as well as a unknown and very angry monster.This film is a roller coaster of emotions for the audience. The movie starts out a little slow, but quickly picks up the tension as the plane goes down. The suspense builds as the characters run for their life into an abandoned cabin while being chased by something in the shadows. The action starts to get a little repetitive as they keep moving from safe house to safe house. Why they keep going outside when they know something is out there to kill them is beyond me. The questions start to rise again as they find a truck but decide to drive back to the crash site instead of just driving away to safety.The one black eye of the cast was the young girl, Trish, who comes across as very obnoxious in the beginning and doesn't really let up as the film progresses. The rest of the casting was top notch as the actors were believable and had definitely been in films before. I'm sure a lot of the film was improv and the cast did very well in keeping the scene progressing as a number of the takes were many minutes in length.The blood and wounds were very realistic and I must applaud work done on the wreckage of the plane. As for the ""monster""...I would have rather never even seen a single frame of this mess. I am still boggled by what the filmmakers used as the unknown stalker in this film. This pretty much killed the film for me. The other negative was the twist ending that still has me scratching my head. This scene should have NEVER made the final cut of the film. The reveal of the monster, along with the addition of an unneeded character, left me completely baffled and unsatisfied.Overall, the film is very well paced and edited and the length of shots lasted is very impressive. This found footage film is very well produced and has many bright spots. Although the intrigue takes a nose dive after a while, the begging tension is well worth the watch. If you come across this film and have 90 minutes to spare, keep an open mind check out Area 407.",Fear Takes Flight,1337990400,"05 26, 2012"

"If you've only read James Ellroy's crime novels, you've been missing out on the eccentric persona behind the pages. Perhaps a little Ellroy will go a long way  he's a bit of a love it or hate it proposition. Having been a successful writer for thirty years, he has a fascination with the dark side and his obsession invariably led to ""L. A.: City of Demons""  an original documentary series for the Investigation Discovery network (admit it, you spend hours perusing ID). Ellroy has an inherent fascination with the underbelly of Los Angeles which began with the brutal slaying of his mother and is showcased in some of his most noteworthy books (Black Dahlia, L. A. Confidential). With his larger than life personality in full affect and his offbeat verbal stylings in unique form, Ellroy actually kicks off this six episode production with a feature that includes his mother's murder.His potboiler style, nihilism, and noir conventions actually align fairly well with the stories he wishes to share in this series. This probably won't be used as promotional material by the Los Angeles Department of Tourism any time soon.(1) Dead Women Own Me: Ellroy explores cases that have had a real impact on his life and psyche including the aforementioned Black Dahlia and his mother's case.(2) The Scandal Rags: Explores the pulp publications that made notoriety with high profile stories such as the Lana Turner scandal.(3) L.

I could spend hours, personally, with this oddball character. The beauty of Ellroy is that he's his own biggest fan, an unapologetic egotist who fervently believes he is the world's greatest living crime novelist. He may well be  but his unabashed self idolatry and aggrandizement may be off putting to those who aren't used to it. In addition to Ellroy, the series really ups the odd quotient with the participation of an animated bull terrier named Barko. Did I just throw you off? Trust me, it is as weird as it sounds. Most of the series and the exchanges with Barko, in particular, seem to exist solely in Ellroy's head. By placing himself front and center (he doesn't share screen time with other real people), Ellroy puts the primary focus on himself. And while I love it, it also pushes the actual show content to a position of less importance. Therefore, I think fans will love it  but I'm not sure if it will be winning new devotees to the cult of Ellroy's greatness. Hence, my neutral rating is largely for the uninitiated.

"I've watched most of the pilots here and I have to say, this one is my favorite.First off, I'm okay with the fact that they had to use animatics because stop motion is a long process. For the segments that were fully animated, it was gorgeous. I loved the lighting and colors. Stop motion animation is medium that is severely underutilized in my opinion. Pure eye candy. It's too bad that a some people will (understandably) lower their rating because of it being unfinished. The comedy is good too   really good considering this is only a pilot episode. I thought the stoner humor bits were kind of weak, but the rest was solid. Was laughing the whole time.I also really like the premise. Plain old joes working for the bad guys because they need the money, while the people who they work for don't particularly seem fond of their jobs themselves. This is all wrapped up in a Star Wars theme which can potentially create a lot of really interesting situations.Dark Minions is charming. It really stands out from the crowd due to it's animation style and premise.I loved the episode. I would recommend it to people who love all things sci fi and silly. Really hope this one gets picked up.","Thank God, something different",1366502400,"04 21, 2013"

"I needed a show to watch after Breaking Bad and the easiest thing to do is simply not change the channel, and that's how I discovered AMC's newest drama, Low Winter Sun. The show is an adaptation of the novel, Low Winter Sun by Simon Donald and if it sounds familiar to you, that because it has already been turned into a movie, back in 2006. While the show has a great time slot and a star who is already familiar with the role he's playing, the ratings for the show have been low and it's because the show has a lot of bark, but it really doesn't have any bite.Set in the bankrupt city of Detroit, Low Winter Sun, tells the story of two police detectives, who murdered a third. The dead man, Det. McCann was dirty and was putting the whole department at risk and they did what they had to do. The murder of a cop in Detroit is big news and the Mayor wants it solved by the two best homicide detectives they have, who also happen to be the killers themselves. The men are being watched by internal affairs and the mayor, so they have to make it look like they are really trying to solve the case, but a third party keeps getting in the way. This party who unintentionally keeps popping up, is the mob affiliated group that had McCann on their payroll. Their activities threaten the investigation which could ultimately lead back to the two detectives.The story makes for a good movie, but if this show is somehow renewed, which direction does it go it? Much like the Killing, this show is centered on one murder, but here the two main characters are the killers. Either they get caught and the series has to start a new in season two or the same story will just keep repeating itself until nobody cares anymore.The lead in the show is Mark Strong, who also played the lead in the 2006 film. The role calls for a smart, yet emotional character with a scared past, and to me the man just doesn't fit the role. Strong is a big tough guy, who is seemingly emotionless, and while he appears to be a smart cop, he just really doesn't fit or appeal to me as the lead detective.His partner is played by Lennie James, better know as Robert Hawkins in Jericho. This guy is one of the best law enforcement actor they could have gotten. James has been in a ton of things, always playing some type of law enforcer. He is experience and really terrific in everything he does. If it wasn't for him, I don't know if I'd be watching this show right now.The cast is rounded out by Sprauge Grayden who has gained some notoriety from the Paranormal Activity films. She is the missing link, caught in the middle between the mob aspect and the cops, having connections to both sides. She's really playing both sides and could ultimately hold the key to what is going to happen, as the first season comes to a close.Overall, Low Winter Sun isn't bad, but not great either. The story is strong and would make a good movie plot, but it seems like there aren't many places to go after they tell the initial story. The intensity they advertise in the commercials has yet to appear, and the show really doesn't have a way of getting people hooked on the story. I've been watching it because I'm a fan of Lennie James and it's on after Breaking Bad. If it wasn't for the time slot, I probably wouldn't have continued after the first episode and I suspect that others feel the same way, as the show has cancelled written all over it.",The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1379116800,"09 14, 2013"

"Based on a real life case involving a New York real estate family, ALL GOOD THINGS centers on the life of David Marks (Ryan Gosling), who has been permanently psychologically scarred by the sight of the death of his mother at seven years old.  He meets and marries beautiful blonde Katie McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst), and the two of them settle down to a life running a health food store in Vermont.  Soon Digby is recalled by his dominant father (Frank Langella) into the family 'business,' which involves a multitude of shady deals.  David returns to New York, and his true nature emerges.  Told over a period of thirty years, ALL GOOD THINGS boasts a strong central performance from Gosling as David, with good support from the other two principals.  Yet its narrative is sluggish, to say the least; there are too many dissolves from one sequence to another, accompanied by the kind of idyllic music and photography that looks and sounds good but holds up the development of the plot.  The d&eacute;cor is stunning; but the story has a rather insubstantial feel about it.","Good as Far as it Goes, but the Narrative Could do with a Little Livening Up",1367366400,"05 1, 2013"
"I think it is safe to say that most of us in here taking the time to write a review about why we like this show or don't, it's safe to say that most of us love the show. I cant or wont say to much as the season just ended. Plus they don't have it coming back during it's normal time of the year.  They are pushing it back, and there are rumors of How we might have seen the last episode. Now if we have seen the last episode, I can say they did it perfect.  I absolutely loved it. I enjoyed the Red John theme, the chemistry between all of the characters, and especially I loved the last episode the most out of every episode they ever written, this was my favorite. I don't want to spoil it, so I will just say for those who know the show, you are off your rocker if you don't finish out this season...I think the ending was wonderful. This was a very unique show, not your normal poice drama at all.  It is funny, full of drama, and very intense at times. The show has it all. And now they have done a few things different with this season, and the ending, I hope they give it one more year so they can see the ratings will climb even more, so the Mentalist addicts may see more then just one more season.  I really hope they give it one more season, that way they can see that the fruits of their labor has paid off.

After a few episodes, it gets to the point of, &#34; grow up and move on already.&#34; if you like your police procedural with the emphasis on interpersonal relationships, maybe this is a good series for you, but I rather watch a police procedural for the crime and it's solution, not a soap opera.","Good, but becomes annoying",1400544000,"05 20, 2014"

The so called &#34;great reviews&#34; are also misleading. You probably might watch it anyway, to see for yourself, but believe me, you'll wish you had that time back. This film is boring, has a convoluted storyline and seems pretty disjointed. All in all, a waste of time. Really, just a story of different mobsters jockeying for position and pointlessly and carelessly beating and killing everyone and each other along the way. But don't expect any martial arts, there isn't any. There's some witch slapping, some beatings (that you don't really see all that well), too many point blank gunshots, stilted dialog. In this film, everyone is corrupt, even the cops. Predictably boring finale as well. Just a bunch of grown men acting like punks. Pjazz this one by.","Amazon's stock review is totally misleading.

"Overall, the actors do look like their real life counterparts and are fairly convincing as the Kennedy family. However, as others have noted, there are factual inaccuracies in The Kennedys and the series seems to rush at the end. I tend to be forgiving about minor factual inaccuracies if they are necessary to further the movie or appeal to a wider audience. However, The Kennedys makes a bit mistake by totally ignoring Ted Kennedy. It's as if Jack and Bobby didn't have a younger brother! I understand the producers wanted to fit the series into 8 episodes, but to leave Teddy Kennedy out completely? I like the idea of a TV mini series about the Kennedys, but it should be done right and give due attention to all three of the brothers.",Where's Teddy?,1325980800,"01 8, 2012"
"Although I am certain that some people will not like ""ATM,"" I actually found it to be a relatively enjoyable little thriller.  As a B movie guilty pleasure, this slight film benefits from having modest ambitions.  Thus, with its limited scope, I think it works satisfactorily as a pleasing and entertaining diversion.  You want a big complicated plot?  You need interesting back story?  You want character motivation?  Don't bother with any of that!  ""ATM"" plays out as a simple, but extravagant, nightmare.  Three young professionals visit an ATM booth in the middle of the night only to have that seemingly mundane decision irrevocably change their lives.  A menacing figure watches them from afar.  And as they contemplate what to do, his murderous intentions become quite clear.  Who is he?  Why has he targeted this trio?  Again, the plot that holds ""ATM"" together is sketchy at best.  You'll get the most enjoyment by not thinking about it, not analyzing the logic, just experiencing it.  Normally, I might not have thrown aside intellectual reservations but I found the cast appealing and reasonably resourceful so, in this instance, I was willing to go along for the ride.It helps immeasurably that the movie casts Brian Geraghty, Josh Peck, and Alice Eve in the principle roles.  All are exceedingly likable, their chemistry is palpable, and their discourse is amusing.  We meet the trio at an office Christmas party.  Geraghty is secretly crushing on Eve and his chance to score some alone time with her is compromised when he has to give his intrusive friend (Peck) a ride home as well.  They are soon on the road, bantering playfully.  A last minute decision to score some cash (who doesn't love late night eats?) begins a hellish descent into surviving at all costs.  To make the situation particularly delightful, they park (for the sake of plot convenience) a spectacular distance from the booth.  It's so silly, you have to laugh along!  Later on a security guard will do the same thing!  But once confined in the booth, the film generates a fair amount of suspense as they try to figure out what to do.  And the performances are committed and believable.As I said, ""ATM"" doesn't attempt anything too complex and that's why it works as well as it does.  I'd have preferred that the danger be a random madman, but as in movies of this type  he seems to be a skillful genius.  But I did think the movie was fun and I really think that is all it was aspiring to be.  About 3 1 2 stars.  This gritty little picture won't win any awards, but it pjazzes a tense 90 minutes.

"Faring better here than he did with his last lackluster effort (Doomsday), director Neil Marshall's Centurion details the story of Roman soldier Quintus Dias (rising star Michael Fjazzbender), who after becoming the sole survivor of a Pictish raid, finds himself among the Ninth Legion led by a heroic general (The Wire's Dominic West) to take the fight directly to the Pict.  Things end up not going so well, as soon enough Quintus and a handful of others are hunted down by the fierce, animalistic warriors.  While Centurion offers up ample amounts of bloody violence, warrior philosophy, and gorgeous cinematography; the film as a whole doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before in any other media of this type, whether it be 300 (which Fjazzbender and West both oddly enough starred in), HBO's Rome, or even the Spartacus series on Starz, minus the slow motion quick edit fight scenes that is, which we should all be thankful for here.  Still though, the cast is great, with Quantum of Solace beauty Olga Kurylenko being a stand out as a mute, vengeance driven Pict femme fatale.  All in all, Centurion isn't bad one bit, and is a nice return to form for Neil Marshall, who brought us modern day genre cljazzics like Dog Soldiers and The Descent, and if nothing else, hopefully Centurion is the starting point in the right direction for the director to go.","Interesting enough, but offers plenty of what we've seen before",1288656000,"11 2, 2010"

"The season isn't as formulaic as one would suppose.Basic Concept, the main guy is a ""Grimm"", which means that he and his ancestors somehow gained the ability to ""see"" people who aren't quite people, but only when they get upset (they take on animalish aspects when upset, elsewise they look fairly normal).Each episode seemingly brings you another animal type, according to the background the whole thing is based on the stories by the brother's Brimm (Hence the name), and season one had it's take on Little Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks, etc.NOTHING like the original material in so far as plot,  think more using the story concept as a jumping off point, twisting it for our times and putting it in Portland or the immediate area.Tends towards a bloody resolution, some obligatory dead bodies, that sort of thing.Entertaining, but would get boring if not for the back story of the other characters.Wife gets mystically whacked by a witch and loses her memory (Season is spent pretty much getting that back and realizing she still loves Grimm.  A bit drawn out, but the ideas and way it was handled was a nice diversion from what you'd expect).The Grimm's at one point worked for a royal family in Europe, but no more, and of course they have a secret key that when stacked with another 6 keys leads to a super secret something.  A bit contrived, particularly the structure of the keys, but a ....  wait for it...  KEY plot device in moving the background story forward.There's also some comedy and romance in the thing as well.I subscribed to the series, don't regret it, but then again, seldom find myself wanting to go back and review a lot of the episodes.","Decent Season, plots a bit thin at points",1369353600,"05 24, 2013"

"Look, I totally get that Dario Argento has a devoted fan base and so I am not writing this review to insult either the director or his followers but rather for unwary horror fans (like me) that might be confused by so many glowing reviews found on this page.""Argento's Dracula"" really kept me guessing on just how to view it; i.e. is it trying to be legit horror or campy, shoestring budget, fictional cloning that includes some soft porn?  If it's trying to be legitimate horror, then consider the following:  Many of us have likely witnessed finer, acting performances at a local, high school play...  in fact it may be an insult to high schools all over America to compare the two.  Additionally, you've probably seen better quality costumes and wigs on display at informal Halloween parties over the years; and if said party had generic, scary music playing in the background then it was decidedly preferable to the scoring for this flick.  Furthermore if you've ever been completely engrossed in your work at any time and someone innocently walked up from behind and tapped you on the shoulder, thus scaring you, said encounter would represent a substantially greater fear factor than this movie possesses, whereas If you remember playing video games in the 90's and were enthralled by the cut scenes then you will have witnessed infinitely better CGI.  And finally, if you've ever been privy to a sixth grade book report on Bram Stoker's Dracula then you would inevitably find a more professional script than can be found in this film.I felt really bad for Rutger Hauer (Van Helsing) who seems like he accidentally wandered onto the set from the local rest home, Thomsas Kretschmann (Dracula... no I mean he's Dracula) does a really lousy Gary Oldman impersonation and Asia Argento (the chick on the cover) is just straight up embarrjazzing to watch.  In all fairness, I have seen worse horror films (""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" & ""Manos, Hands of Fate"" come to mind) however I absolutely would not recommend spending actual money on watching this cheese festival (lucky for me it was on Netflix) cuz it sucks really, really bad.  :o)",Dracula's Hopped up on Goofballs,1391472000,"02 4, 2014"

The problem is, though they are able to get the boy, an army of hired thugs stand in the way before their mission is completely over.""The Baytown Outlaws"" directed and co written by Barry Battles (his feature debut) starts out promisingly. And you know, the villain is played by always reliable Billy Bob Thornton. Sadly, the role doesn't give him much to work on. The same can be said about the character played by Zo Bell, though both players are doing their best. Eva Longoria doesn't have much to do.The film's bloody and over the top shoot outs didn't bother me much. Neither did the stereotypical descriptions of the characters, which I think is intentional. Some may compare this with Tarantino and ""Mad Max"" movies. I am not sure the comparison is valid; violent as they are, directors like Quentin Tarantino and George Miller have distinct styles in dialogue and action, which are missing in ""The Baytown Outlaws."" In fact, ""The Baytown Outlaws"" takes itself too seriously in its final act, posing philosophical questions which few of us would be interested in.With a weak subplot about a local sheriff (Andre Braugher) and an ATF agent (Paul Wesley), ""The Baytown Outlaws"" slowly loses its steam despite several interesting oddball characters. The movie is enjoyable, but it could have been more so with a better script.","""The Baytown Outlaws"": The Title Says It All",1378684800,"09 9, 2013"
"I was excited to watch this when I saw Chris Carter was behind the helm (big fan of both X Files and Millennium). I suggest not reading too many reviews before viewing for the first time, because  the less you know the more entertaining it will be.  If you like stories that are slow to reveal any answers, you will likely enjoy The After; if you need everything spoonfed to you and everything wrapped up in a neat little package at the end  then stay away from this pilot. The greatest compliment I can give this pilot episode is that I never knew what was going to happen next. The viewer is just as lost and confused as the story's characters are. Few questions are resolved, and many are raised. This alone will turn some people off.While the main cast of characters can seem somewhat cliche or stereotyped (a slick lawyer, beautiful call girl, drunken Irishman, a wrongfully accused felon, a rich old lady, the young female cop, etc.), the acting is very good and the story itself rises above any of the cliches. The pilot episode succeeded in creating an atmosphere of uneasiness and apocolypic mayhem on a big budget scale.While a great pilot doesn't necessarily equate to a great series, I think the possibilities are endless. Plus, I think Chris Carter has proven his writing prowress with his previous works.SPOILER ALERT: Don't read on if you plan to watch the episode but haven't yet.Chris Carter's previous successes have dealt with science and extraterrestrial existance (X Files) and the occult & religion (&#34;Millennium&#34;). I think he's exploring similar themes again, and this pilot has accomplished to blend the best of both into its running time. Whether we're dealing with aliens or demons (I think its a demon, but that's another big question that the show should take its time in answering). Needless to say, &#34;The After&#34; needs to continue on as either a full blown series or a miniseries... However long it takes to tell its tale. This has the potential to be on par with other such successes as &#34;Lost&#34;, &#34;Walking Dead&#34;, and then &#34;X Files,&#34;",Wow!.... Just Wow!,1391817600,"02 8, 2014"

"This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.The film begins with a shot of Goode's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just becausea customer wanted it more well done.Afterwards we were introduced to Goode' ex(?) wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumpedinto him.  Then someone was in the hospital(dying?) and tears were shed.I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and notremembered them in correct orders.What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior.  There were a lot in the movies.It was the annoying non linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why can't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non linear?Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.Using non linear filming style must have its justifications.The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least,and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end.",Obnoxious & Pretentious-1st 30 Mins,1357776000,"01 10, 2013"
"""John Dies at the End"" is based on the novel by David Wong (a pseudonym for author Jason Pargin). It's director Don Coscarelli's (""Phantasm,"" ""Bubba Ho Tep"") first feature film in ten years. The horror comedy did make the rounds at certain film festivals in 2012, but is getting a limited theatrical run in certain markets in 2013 and is already available on demand. If you've never read Wong's novel, you don't really know what you're getting yourself into. Reception thus far has been mostly negative labeling the film as incredibly bizarre without much of a payoff, but that isn't entirely accurate. Speaking as someone who's a stickler for solid writing in cinema, this is a rare instance where a film can still be pretty enjoyable without everything making sense.Dave (Chase Williamson) is sitting in a dimly lit Chinese restaurant telling his unbelievable story to a reporter named Arnie (Paul Giamatti) and it's a doozy. After Dave is able to analyze everything about the change in Arnie's pocket without seeing it and knowing every detail of the dream Arnie had the night before without Arnie even bringing it up, Arnie is eventually able to come to the realization that this is no normal story. When Dave was still in high school, his friend John (Rob Mayes) was in a band. At a party that John's band was playing at, Dave met a Jamaican guy named Robert Marley (Tai Bennett) who not only knew everything about Dave but seemed to know every detail about everything before it happened. That is how Dave and John were introduced to a drug known as ""soy sauce,"" a black liquid which ""opens their minds to s*** they've never seen before;"" those are the words of Robert Marley. Overloaded with heightened senses, Dave and John are now able to communicate and interact with creatures that aren't from this world but have bigger problems to worry about like how to defeat a monster made of refrigerated meats or figuring out how to throw a headstrong detective (Glynn Turman) off their trail. Arnie has the story of the century on his hands as Dave's story proves to be a prime example of truth being stranger than fiction.The erratic atmosphere and disorganized sense of humor makes itself apparent right from the very first frame with Dave's story about whether an axe is still the same axe if its had its head and handle replaced while killing a skinhead. Its messy pace takes some getting used to. The beginning of Dave's story where he and John try to help a girl named Shelly (Allison Weissman) deal with an abusive boyfriend that died two months prior is bizarre. Not only because of the subject content, but also because the chemistry between actors Chase Williamson and Rob Mayes and their desire to help those who've had problems with the paranormal is eerily similar to Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki as Sam and Dean Winchester on ""Supernatural."" As soon as you think that though, the film seems to steer in a completely different direction as Shelly explodes into snakes, a doorknob turns into male genitalia, and that refrigerated meat manifestation appears.That's about when all of these recognizable faces start appearing; Clancy Brown as TV psychic Albert Marconi who's a lot like John Edward except Marconi actually knows what he's talking about, Angus Scrimm in a small role as a priest, and Doug Jones portraying a man from another dimension named Ryan North. You'll actually be left wanting more of Arnie (Giamatti) and Ryan North (Jones). Paul Giamatti is still able to steal the spotlight even though he's only a supporting actor here. His line delivery is just the perfect amount of over the top disbelief when Dave shows Arnie what he has in his car and Arnie's line about Atlantic City is laugh out loud funny. The film is literally overflowing with sarcasm. There's so much of it that you feel like you may have missed some of its wit in just one viewing. When you're not laughing about how ridiculous the film is its humor is sure to circle back around to make sure you laugh at least once during the film's 90 minute duration.After you settle into the film's use of controlled insanity (it's like trying to throw a saddle on a tornado before attempting to ride it), you get used to its crazy pace and begin to enjoy it. The film is particularly pretty awesome until Dave and John go to another dimension and meet Korak, then it's just bat s*** insanity. The horror comedy gets even weirder than you'd come to expect from the first hour. Nothing about the film is predictable, so there is that to fall back on. But people who don't already hate the film will really hate it by the time the last twenty or so minutes come around.""John Dies at the End"" is really freaking weird. It's along the lines of Quentin Dupieux's ""Rubber,"" but really pushes the boundaries of absurdity. With its flying moustaches, severed limbs with a mind of their own, having conversations with bratwursts, and a dog driving a truck through a house that's on fire, it's safe to say that ""John Dies at the End"" will go well over many heads and won't be appreciated and that's fine.

"The only thing worse than having to watch a movie you never really cared for to begin with is being forced to watch it again and then realizing you can't stand it. That's exactly what happened with first time director Nicholas Jarecki's ""Arbitrage."" Starring Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, Brit Marling, and Tim Roth, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of a billionaire named Robert Miller (Gere). Robert is the manager of a hedge fund empire that is supposedly one of the most profitable in the business, but Robert altered his books and committed fraud. Even though he's covered his tracks, the fraud is still there. On Robert's 60th birthday, a deal that will tie up all the loose ends and keep Robert and his family very happy and wealthy is on the verge of being negotiated. But that's when things begin to get a bit more complicated in Robert's life and his lies begin to get the best of him.""Arbitrage"" was one of the first screeners sent out to critics during the awards season. The movie is getting a ton of buzz because of Richard Gere's performance, so it was thrown into the nearest movie playing device and watched as quickly as possible. Needless to say, it was a huge letdown and was pjazzable at best. So many screeners are sent out to critics every year, but this was the first year that the majority of the pile was watched on this end. So after viewing 30 or 40 movies since its initial viewing, ""Arbitrage"" shows up on Blu ray in the mail and since the specifics of the movie had become so blurred since the last viewing another one was in order. Its second viewing only makes the experience feel even more mundane.Robert Miller isn't exactly an upstanding citizen. Hell, he isn't even likeable. Robert Miller is only watching out for Robert Miller. He only does what benefits himself. He tries to make it seem like he's worried about his family, but he's honestly just obsessed with money and is afraid of tarnishing his reputation. Richard Gere's performance isn't bad, but it doesn't really deserve a ton of accolades either. He's a guy that's buried himself in his own grave who's now mimicking a cockroach who won't die while scurrying along and trying to find any escape route that he can. Gere mostly just seems to throw temper tantrums and has a few emotional outbursts, but is nothing special overall. He yells a lot, but his go to method is yelling completely belittling things to whoever he's talking to before whispering that they should come sit next to him so he can show them something. This happens on at least three different occasions with two different individuals.The movie is also a total waste of Tim Roth. Going into this, you may think to yourself that maybe Roth will at least have some enjoyable scenes. That unfortunately isn't really the case. Det. Michael Bryer (Roth) is a cop who plays dirty without actually being a dirty cop, if that makes any sense. He pulls strings to do things that aren't by the book, but it's to put the ones who deserve to be behind bars where they belong. Roth mostly just acts tough without ever doing anything to back it up or possibly never really having the chance. The most enjoyable part of his performance is his handlebar mustache. Brit Marling and Susan Sarandon feel wasted as well, but the wound doesn't feel quite as deep. Marling portrays Robert's daughter Brooke who also works for him while Sarandon is Robert's wife. Marling's only real shining moment is a shouting match with her father in a public park, but the scene only makes you wonder why nobody is stopping or taking notice of the argument even though it gets extremely heated. Sarandon's highlight is acting too busy to talk to Tim Roth even though she doesn't really have much going on, but honestly anything feels like a step up for her after her appearance in ""That's My Boy.""""Arbitrage"" attempts to be this thrilling and compelling piece of cinema and it just isn't. There are several different storylines going on throughout the movie, but it all just feels very ho hum; you don't care about any of it. Robert tries to be portrayed in this light that he's a wolf in sheep's clothing, but he's more of a rat in a skin suit. You have no desire to see his story go one way or the other. Not to mention that he bleeds internally for like a week and barely acknowledges it after the first night. With all of the cheating, the lying, the backstabbing, and innocent people who are trying to turn their life around and yet are getting hurt because of Robert, ""Arbitrage"" is the story of one rich man's downward spiral where both sides lie to try to get what they want but both walk away empty handed. It all results in a standstill that is about as thrilling as a staring contest.Special features on the Blu ray of the film include Commentary with Writer Director Nicholas Jarecki, the 12.5 minute ""A Glimpse into Arbitrage"" featurette which features the cast and crew discussing the film, the 7 minute ""Who is Robert Miller?"" featurette, and 10 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Director Commentary.",It's like living through a 1000 year jail sentence,1356220800,"12 23, 2012"

"""All Good Things"" was directed by Andrew Jarecki and stars Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst as the couple, David (Ryan Gosling) and Katie Marks (Kirsten Dunst). Inspired by the life of Robert Durst, this story tells the tale of a real estate heir whose wife disappears. This film is based on a real unsolved mystery and provides speculation of what may have occurred based on tons of research, interviews, and a lengthy courtroom transcript.David and Katie begin in love as opposites attract, him being from a rich family and she being a working cljazz student. They move away from the city and try to open a health food store but are lured back by David's father (played by Frank Langella) to join the family business. David talks to himself often and witnessed his mother's death at a young age. He views Katie as the perfect woman because he could do anything and she loved him. Their differences come between them about whether to have children and Katie's desire to go to med school and two months away from graduation when she contemplates divorcing him, she disappears.Ryan Gosling was an excellent casting choice for the role of David because he can show some charm and justification for why a girl might fall for him (as in ""Blue Valentine"") and then flip it on its head and explore all these behaviors of the character as he gets progressively more disturbing. Kirsten Dunst as Katie is a charismatic beautiful young woman who can instantly put people at ease and transitions into a lethargic emotional mess over time. They have good chemistry together and sell that the couple was in love initially before things got complicated. What is most intriguing about the film is David's behavior AFTER Katie's disappearance when he goes into hiding dressing in disguise.This film was pushed back several times after being filmed in 2008 and slated for a release in 2009 and finally ended up in limited released in December 2010 and is now coming out on Blu ray and DVD. It is strange that this story about a relationship that doesn't quite work anymore didn't catch any attention around the same time that ""Blue Valentine"" was released which got lots of attention for Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams.Bonus Features:All Good Things   Truth in Fiction is a half hour feature that reveals how much of the story came out of courtroom documents from Bob Durst's testimony. They gathered together several sources and interviews to try and piece together a 360 degree view of what may have happened in speculation. Some of the dialogue in the film is directly from these interviews. They researched for two and a half years before starting filming. Kirsten Dunst met with the Durst family and learned a great deal about her character. There is twenty minute feature called ""Back in Time: Researching the Original Story"" that shows clips of several of the interviews done to research the film of actual people who knew Robert and Kathie Durst.There's an interview with director Andrew Jarecki where he talks about the interviews they did in researching the story and how they put them together in documentary form to show people as they created the movie and to remind themselves during the writing process. It's a VERY thorough interview where he talks about everything with the movie and goes on for an hour! There is also a sped up video of the process of aging Ryan Gosling to play David Marks in his later years. There are only a few deleted scenes, one washing dishes in the kitchen getting to know Katie's mother, another showing Katie training in the medical field, Katie confronting David about Polaroids she found, and David trying to get food stamps in a tuxedo which is very weird.There is full length commentary with director Andrew Jarecki and writers Marcus Hinchey and Marc Smerling. There is also commentary with the director and Robert Durst whom the story is based on so of course after hearing all the background on this story and the interviews, I couldn't resist hearing what the actual guy says about this movie based on him. He verifies that Frank Langella's portrayal of his father is spot on and expresses regrets about how he treated Kathy's family and how rude he was. Every comment is prompted by the director who is interviewing Robert as the film progresses. Each scene that plays out, Andrew asks Robert if it was like that and Robert usually confirms it (or it sounds even worse than the movie plays it to be). He indicated that they were both unfaithful to each other late in the relationship (not covered in the film). It's fascinating to hear his side or defense.",All Good Things - Reviewed by Haunted Flower,1301443200,"03 30, 2011"

"This sentence summarizes the movie and also the actual mentality of most medical doctors. Everybody wants the Mercedes with the Hopkins plates. Usually is not the most competent person that gets it, but the most politically correct with a lot of friends. Hence, we still have cancer rates as high as 1950 and we don't have any cures therapies for diseases that should have been eradicated by now. But we have a lots of poor individuals dying painfully from chemotherapy.There are two plots in this movie. In both of them Orlando Bloom performs pretty well as a crazy doctor (Martin Blake) in need of attention from his supervisors. In the first plot the doctor becomes fascinated with a patient and manipulates her drugs in order to keep her in the hospital. This plot failed in my eyes because is totally unrealistic for two reasons. First, the doc has way too much easy access to all the facilities in the hospital. This is totally unrealistic and poorly done. He can come and go freely in the pharmacy and the lab, switching pills and modifying the covers of Petri dishes. Second, if he loves her so much he must know that if she doesn't get her antibiotics she will die and he will lose her. But he is crazy, and maybe a psychopath? That may explain many things. This part of the plot is not very well developed.In the second plot Bloom is in constant need of attention from his supervisors who don't necessarily know more than him, but pretend pretty well, and are used to have patients die on them (...sometimes you have difficult cases; and you did everything by the book, etc...). This part of the plot is really well done and makes total sense in my eyes.The acting is quite remarkable. Orlando Bloom and Riley Keough are just fantastic. The nurse (Taraji P. Henson) and the detective (JK Simmons) are remarkable and add to the movie. JK Simmons reminded me of Columbo!Three stars because of the acting only.

The set up isn't a creative one.  Twenty three year old geeky children's book author Sam Davis (Michael Angarano) isn't having much success and he's recently dumped by the statuesque Zoe (Thurman).  Now right there we have a problem.  Sam is about 5 foot nothing and Zoe is about a foot taller, not to mention well on her way to 40.  Don't get me wrong, the problem isn't there physical differences, it's that there is no chemistry or attraction for the audience.  Sam and his best friend Marshall (Reece Daniel Thompson) decide to get away to rekindle their bromance (strictly hetero).  They run into Zoe who is about to get married on the beach.

"Before reviewing this Video on Demand screening of Hobo with a Shotgun, let me state that some people might not like the way it is made. It has Grindhouse qualities mingled with overkill and that strange hero, and the humor mingled with the violence might go right past some people. If that sounds bad to you, let it go or watch it later. Anyone else, you might like this.Hobo with a Shotgun is a tale of a homeless man who seems to have a lot of bad breaks. He is not down on things, however, and seems content with certain aspects of his life. Still, he has a dream. He wants to buy a lawnmower and get out. Then he sees a girl, his ""schoolteacher,"" and notices that she is about to become a victim. That sets him on a collison course with the guys running the whole of the town he is taking on.First, let me sau that the acting and the lines here were great. I have always been a fan of Rutger anyhow, and this portrayal is a nice one. His character reminds me of someone that is going for that Man with No Name feel, and he does it well. He has this look, almost always angry and certainly mad in some respect, but there is a bit of hope in him. He also has lines like ""I'll be sleeping in your carcjazz tonight"" and ""I'll be carving welfare checks out of your skin,"" working to reinforce the Hobo aspect of his persona. It worked for me.The setting itself is one tha seems like a world gone mad. There are times when blood opens and sprays and when drugs are thrown out in piles. In fact, there is barely any realism to the hyper violence and I think that works. Too many people are turned aside by that and, honestly, how many fingers can one person lose before the following line is not funny if it really looks real?The bad guys range from ordinary people being enslaved to their lifestyles to pimps and more. Stil, there is one major bad guy and his sons. The Drake and his sons, Slick and Ivan, are pretty funny in their own rights. They really have something to add and they bring their own type of killing to the set. Honestly, I loved the way they played here, too.If you do not want the blood mingled with, well, blood, you might miss the type of film this is. Also, you are not going to see people go unscathed too often. This is a new good guy that emerges from a bad place, but the things that happen are not exactly lovely. The humor and the hyper violent world are throwbacks, to, as is the Technocolor display in the beginning and even the set.

"Paul W. S. Anderson's &#34;Pompeii&#34; is a throwback to all those sword and  sandal epics of yesteryear that combined period piece spectacle with generous dollops of bloodletting, action and romance. This 1st Century soap opera just happens to take place in the shadow of Vesuvius, the volcano that famously erupted in 79 A.D., burying much of the city and its inhabitants in tombs of molten rock and ash.Looking like he barely needed a change of wardrobe from his day job, &#34;Game of Throne's&#34; Kit Harrington plays Milo, a Celtic boy who, after he witnesses his family being slaughtered by Roman troops in the northernmost region of the empire, is forced into slavery and raised to become a gladiator. When he's brought to Pompeii to fight in the arena, he catches the eye of Cjazzia (Emily Browning), a thoroughly anachronistic, sjazzy, forward looking, freethinking type who finds the officials in Rome to be all uncouth barbarians and who has no taste for such popular blood soaked pastimes as fight to the death battles in the coliseum. A ludicrously miscast Keifer Sutherland plays a foul Roman senator who tries to come between the noble woman and the slave.As befits the genre, &#34;Pompeii&#34; is just chockablock with stock characters, cheesy dialogue and corny plotting, though the movie does earn a few points for its unlikely and, dare I say it, even quite brave finale.But, of course, anyone who checks out &#34;Pompeii&#34; will be doing so strictly to witness, albeit vicariously, all the death and destruction visited upon the city and its thousands of inhabitants when Vesuvius finally blows its top. Apparently, overproduced, CGI infested disaster movies are our milder, modern day equivalent to gladiatorial contests. And in that respect, at least, the movie delivers the goods.There's one thing that &#34;Pompeii,&#34; fortunately, doesn't have in common with those toga wrapped spectacles of the past   and that is their extraordinary length. So clocking in at a relatively brief 104 minutes, &#34;Pompeii&#34; has at least one thing going for it.",Disposable sword-and-sandal epic,1402963200,"06 17, 2014"

"The film starts out as an"" Andromeda Strain"" on steroids.  An alien life form that resembles a giant land squid octopus migrates across ""The Infected Zone"" of northern Mexico.

When a rich man's daughter (Whitney Able) gets trapped in Mexico he is tasked to stop what he is doing and escort her back to the US.The film is rather dull in that it focuses on the couple, their travels, and misadventures.

"The main theme of the movie seemed to be the relationship between the Queen's reader, (an excellent job, for the most part, by Lea Sedoux) and the iconic Marie Antoinette (an excellent job by Ms. Kruger). The reader is devoted to the infamous Antoinette, and very protective of her. I never really did figure out why however, was it physical attraction?  (I believe it was  but I'm not sure) or attraction to station. I think this lack of development is the main weakness of the movie. As is the case with all in her despicable cljazz, M. Antoinette betrays the loyalty of the lower cljazzes and wantonly uses her reader for her own devices. Perhaps I'm dense (or we were simply tired when we watched it) but I never really grasped the Readers reaction to that betrayal, was she resigned to it, ready to sacrifice for her beloved, was she enlightened, for the first time realizing the truth about her awful mistress, or was it something else. As a better developed juxtaposition of the sensibilities of this era in French history, or a better developed personal story I might have really adored this movie, as it is beautiful to look at, and the acting is marvelous (there is a brilliant scene where Sea Ledoux is forced to strip, with a gorgounous aristocrat attendant hovering about her, where they all do an excellent job conveying the creepiness of the whole structure of their lives).","It looks beautiful, but could not get into the story (!!!Weak spolier alert here!!!)",1394841600,"03 15, 2014"

"My mom who is 79 years old, loves this show and so does the rest of my family. It makes me depressed. I think the differene is, that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle cljazz so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it. I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life. I have seen metheads, crackheads, tweakers, junkies, you name it and dealers on daily basis, the havoc it rages on whole communities. I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that, the saying goes ""that these people are quite the characters, but have no character"". When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture. Sometimes you just become num. I remember one time, walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I pjazzed some crackheads smoking, to my shame it was ""human garbage"". I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings. The hard part is, that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore. You run into them all the time. The dealers are not without a respect altogether, because when a new one comes around they say ""No she's not like that, leave her alone"".  Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a  ""strait"" person for a customer. However you always have to let them know you are cool so it's a better choise to let them know you a little, that you don't judge them, so they will trust you and leave you alone. Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you don't want enemies.I know all the scum bags, the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope, the corrupt cops, or more like the cops who are so sick of it, they don't want to deal with it.

"I watched this film twice because it was just such a great mixture of bitter and sweet. Its a lovely tale of a relationship between a Chinese orphan and her Australian sponsor. Its an explorative tale of gratitude, innocence and the myth that the West is somehow always better than that in the East. Its a heartwarming tale and the acting by Pierce is wonderful as we would expect but the laurels go to  Zhu Lin. Zhu Lin is inspirational in her performance and over powers every other actors presence throughout the film, even that of Pierce. I would recommend this film to anyone since it left me with such a good feeling and I will be looking out for any film starring Zhu Lin. She produced a wonderfully charming and genuine performance.",Such a nice film,1393200000,"02 24, 2014"

"Leonard is sensitive and charismatic young man.  He is sort of an artist, a self thought photographer who produces black and white pictures of American urban landscape (portraits are not his forte by his own admission).  He reads a lot and is loved and indulged by his parents.  But Leonard is utterly unhappy.  His long term relationship and engagement has ended abruptly and his emotional vulnerability is making it impossible for him to function in a society without medication and constant and vigilant care from his parents.As Leonard is struggling to figure out whether to live or die, he works is his father's dry cleaning business and in a short period of time meets two beautiful but very different women.  One is dark haired, professional and independent, affectionate and caring.  The other is blond, compulsive, party girl, kept by a married man on a side for his personal entertainment.  Inevitably, Leonard is attracted to a troubled and emotionally unavailable girl convinced that he can help her and take care of her.  The social pressures of his parents and prospective business deal, propels him in the arms of the other.As story progresses, we are simply curious to see which girl will be Leonard's final choice.  Is he going to follow his heart, or follow his head?  What is it that each of the women can offer him and what is it that he can offer them?  What is the true love?  Is there a compromise in life that one has to make in order to become functional and even happy?I really liked the movie because the director touches up on all of these points delicately and thoughfully.  As it turns out the improbable sometimes turns out to be probable.  Of course, there is a price to it.  To learn what the price is, you must see this movie.  Many consider Gwyneth Paltrow to be the ""it"" girl.  I am sorry, but in this movie, it is Vinessa Shaw that steals the screen.

"POMPEIICertain stories love being told.  And each time we tell them we sit raptured staring at the screen as the latest technology allows the story to be told in even new and more fabulous ways.  Still, we know how &#8220;Titanic&#8221; ends but we&#8217;ll all line up to see the next iteration of the doomed ship.  We also know how &#8220;Pompeii&#8221; ends and each iteration is born when new technology takes hold.  Pompeii was first told using the silent moving pictures technology of 1913 and not retold until the talkie sound version of 1935.  Then in 1959 it was told in the technology of the day, Eastmancolor.  Jump 40 years into the future and we have CGI and digital special effects.  Woo hoo.Ah the good ole days.  When London is still just an outer province of Rome and a sound sleep after a three day hunt is interrupted by invasion from Roman soldiers under the leadership of soon to be Senator Kiefer Sutherland who kills your family and takes you to Rome to be raised as a finely sculpted slave gladiator.  And through the magic of screenwriting the finally crafted gladiator meets a &#8220;Lady&#8221; on their march to Pompeii.  It&#8217;s been a long walk from Rome but now they&#8217;re home at the base of Mt. Vesuvius which wants to be the Roman version of the Hamptons and where Latin has a distinct British accent.  Fill the set with items from a Toscano catalogue and let the fun begin.I do not appreciate gratuitous violence or sex.  But when your cast must include gladiators it must include both and it is not gratuitous.  The violence moves the story forward instead of filling time and it teaches us about the mercy of the different players.Ah Pompeii &#8211; we see her not in her final days as we expect but in her birth pangs as the soon to be vaction spot of Romans of a certain cljazz.  And who wouldn&#8217;t love to see Keifer Sutherland in a role that requires him to actually speak instead of whisper act.  In fact his performance as Senator is pure joy as the cynical Roman investor who has come to Pompeii on a sort of time share weekend in the Poconos where his hosts are trying to impress him that the Emperor would, indeed, be very smart to invest in the soon to be mecca of Earthly delights.  The rumbling mountain that fills the sky is simply the God Vulcan who apparently is pleased the evil Senator has come to spend the weekend.  Stay for dinner and you&#8217;ll be writing a check by bed time, especially if that bedtime involves you whisper acting your amorous intentions towards your host&#8217;s young daughter, the &#8220;Lady.&#8221;  Hospitality is a Roman virtue after all.  And you just have to know the Aristocrat&#8217;s lovely &#8220;Lady&#8221; daughter and the slave gladiator are bound to &#8220;color outside the lines.&#8221;  Yeah that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s called.  And all the while the mountain rumbles.  The smartest creatures in the film seem to be the horses and gosh darn it wouldn&#8217;t you know it; our hot, sweaty, chiseled  gladiator slave is also a horse whisperer.Many dead Romans later Vesuvius enters stage center and it&#8217;s a grand scene as the decadence is washed away by fire and we understand how we&#8217;ve been shown the backstory to the statues of the lovers discovered at the actual site.  Very satisfying piece of work.  Not groundbreaking, not original, per se and certainly not a contender for any award come award season but you know what?

"I can't begin to tell you how much I detest a majority of the ""found footage"" films. Every time I see a new released, my eyes roll into the back of my head and I sigh heavily. The only reason I picked up ""The Bay"" when I saw it was the box and tagline caught my attention. If it wasn't for Director Barry Levinson's name attached to it, I would have put it back. After watching it, I'd say it's definitely one of the better films using the shtick.In 2009, the town of Chesapeake Bay in Maryland discovers its water is infected. The mayor refuses to admit the seriousness of the situation even as people begin turning up dead and sick. After several more victims die in public, the town goes into a state of fear and closes down. Several eyewitnesses capture the entire incident on camera and cell phones.I still can't believe a renowned director like Barry Levinson would helm a ""found footage"" movie. The entire concept just seems so below him. It's fairly obvious ""The Bay"" was a pet project for Levinson. He's credited as a co producer and co writer of the film. Regardless, he accomplished what he set out to do through adequate pacing and some great stomach churning scenes, which quite possibly could have some individuals scrambling for a barf bag.The visual effects for ""The Bay"" are impressive. They might be doctored a little with CGI, but for the most part they look practical. I don't know what they used for the nasty little creatures, but I was convinced they were real. That's how you know you're seeing a good movie. You're pulled into it and are never distracted by bad special effects or acting.I have to admit that I laughed while watching the credits as they rolled. I saw Oren Peli's name as one of the producers for ""The Bay"" and said to myself, ""Of course."" I've got to hand it to this guy. He's taken an old gimmick and struck gold with it over and over again.""The Bay"" includes a couple special features. There's audio commentary with Director Barry Levinson. We also get a featurette entitled ""Into the Unknown: Barry Levinson on 'The Bay.'""I can't deny ""The Bay"" is worth a watch. The concept of the film is very believable.

"Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places.  In the case of Dexter, it was at my day job. Now my office job is not normally the place one jazzociates with a show like Dexter, but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show. The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium (like HBO's Rome, for example) piqued my curiosity. Unfortunately, it took me over a year to actually view season one.  I'm sorry I waited so long.I've done enough research on serial killers (and their fictional cousin, slashers) to know that they're easy to mess up.  And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer's perspective is fraught with peril. Fortunately, Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran (Michael C. Hall) is a serial killer with a cause.  His father, Harry (James Remar) recognized his adopted son's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey.  These were the lowest of the low, the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice.  Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts, eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed.  Literally.In his day job, Dexter is a blood spatter analyst.  He works side by side with his adopted sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), probably the most annoying character in the show.  And yet, she's annoying on purpose   her frail, waif like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable, feral and misguided.  In short, she needs Dexter's calm, creepy presence. Rounding out the cast is career climbing Maria Laguerta (Lauren Velez), coworkers Angel Batista (David Zayas) and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee, formerly of the show Chuck) and my favorite character, foul mouthed Sergeant James Doakes (Erik King).  Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is, but he can't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well.  He has a girlfriend, Rita Bennett (Julie Benz), whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy, which suits Dexter just fine.  Indeed, all of Dexter's life is an act, from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita.  He's a monster masquerading as a person, and the only reason it's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims. Despite his penchant for murdering his victims, Dexter's murders are relatively clean   he drains his victims of blood, hacks the pieces up, and tosses them into the ocean.  And so it goes: find some sleazeball who escaped justice, kidnap him or her, murder, dump the body, repeat. Until one day, another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll like murders.The ending of season one won't be a shock to observant viewers.  It's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there. Dexter's narration is amusing and wry, his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional. Surprisingly, the show isn't very gory at all.  Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail.  In fact, by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes, Dexter has to remind us that he's one of the bad guys   the Code of Harry is as much the anti hero's code that we see in a multitude of other crime fighting shows.  It's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous, damaged human being and yet still human.Can't wait for season two!",Dexter Gets it Right,1209254400,"04 27, 2008"
"After visiting Marina (Olga Kurylenko) in Paris, Neil (Ben Affleck) brings Marina and her daughter Tatiana (Tatiana Chiline) back to the states with the intent of getting married and allowing Marina to get her green card. However their relationship hits a rough patch and Marina and Neil both find themselves traveling their own paths. Marina encounters a priest named Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), who seems to have a struggle finding his own happiness. Meanwhile Neil rekindles an old flame with childhood friend Jane (Rachel McAdams).It was difficult to anticipate a film like ""To the Wonder"" since Terrence Malick films are generally pretty abstract. ""The Tree of Life"" felt like half a dozen storylines competing for your attention and none of them felt like they were properly resolved. ""To the Wonder"" continues Malick's streak of featuring incredible cinematography in his pictures. Cathedrals, trickling streams containing slumbering rocks, walking along the beach, a rose bush covered in snow, and an endless array of impressive shots of the sky and animals in their natural habitat; a National Geographic special is like the secondary storyline to Neil and Marina's relationship.The narrative of ""To the Wonder"" feels extremely erratic. It's not that it can't decide who to follow or where to go, but the path it travels seems so random that it feels like someone just closed their eyes, spun around, and pointed and then followed that path for awhile before jumping back to the previous path. The characters are practically driven by indecisiveness. Neil doesn't want to be alone, but can't seem to commit. Marina wants to be with Neil and then she doesn't. She wants to live in the States and then she wants to move back to Paris. Father Quintana wants to help people, but refuses to help himself. Even when these characters get what they want, it's like a flip switches on inside and they can't accept it. It becomes extremely frustrating.What you end up with is constant visits to the drive in restaurant Sonic, repetitive trips to the grocery store, and frolicking through grjazzy field that seem to last a lifetime. Affleck seems to only have a handful of lines and spends most of his time lurking about; pacing around, not talking, and looking disgruntled. There is something in ""To the Wonder."" Something about blossoming relationships always falling apart just when they seem to be at their peak and what appears to be two different lifetimes lived by one man. A priest is able to make others feel good about themselves yet is so empty inside and a woman is in love with a man who's in love with another woman. You're just kind of left dangling when it comes to Jane and Father Quintana and even though the story between Neil and Marina is given the most time its conclusion is mjazzively unsatisfying.While it may be filmed beautifully, ""To the Wonder"" doesn't exactly move its gestating 112 minute duration along any faster with everyone on screen galloping around their front yard or a field full of slow moving bison genitalia. So embrace that obnoxious ten year old of yours, hold a rooster, and lick a tree branch because ""To the Wonder"" is a romantic drama that wanders around so aimlessly it can't decide where to go next.",Drink from this goblet of misdirection,1366329600,"04 19, 2013"

"2012: Apocalypse of the Dead (a.k.a. Zone of the Dead) is one of those flicks that is so horribly bad, it's good. In a way, you almost have to laud the commitment and conviction presented by the filmmakers because it takes those traits to follow thru with (let's just call it) their ""vision."" Anyway, a good time was had at the movies by me and my snarky homies.But it's not a good time to be in Pancevo, Serbia, not tonight. Pancevo is reputed to be the most toxic city in all of Europe. Legendary Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes (Ken Foree) and rookie agent Mina Milius (Kristina Klebe) are the principals in overseeing a prisoner transfer of which route will take them to Belgrave and then London. Did your eyes roll, like mine did, when Reyes rejazzured a nervous Mina: ""If ever there was an easy jazzignment, this is it."" Oboy.But before they get to easy street, they have to pjazz thru Pancevo, just in time for that unnatural chemical leak  at the railroad track and the resulting zombie outbreak. Cornered by zombie hordes, desperate to survive, the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner (Emilio Roso) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later, the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier (fresh out the nunnery) who spouts doomsday propaganda. Weird? Surreal? Creepy? Offputting? Yes. This crazed warrior would go on to say (with gusto) things like: ""Smells like the end of days.""Oh, where to start, where to start? I'm tempted to give this a higher rating, only because I had ba11s of fun. But I won't. This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie, so congratulations, but it's crap. The production is so low budget I suspect my 6 year old niece was the money behind it. The acting   I'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically. Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I'd ever heard. The intonations, the inflections, are weird. The body language is off. But I don't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue. They're also ridiculous. The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match. My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree, who was so badjazz in Romero's seminal Dawn of the Dead (and maybe the best zombie film of all time). Here   and, given, it's some thirty years later   Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements? Are weak. The zombie make up is pjazzable. But there's not much in the way of authentic scares. The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily. Neither are there memorable zombie kills. What's more, the zeds can't make up their minds whether they're slow shufflers or fast, hyperactive runners.The film isn't well served by its characters making moronic decisions (given, most are there to engorge the body count). Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives? Yes, there are some, other than the happy accident of the film's sucking so hard, it gets good. Three good things. The Serbian setting is appropriately moody. I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13. The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance. The other neat thing is the meta reference to Dawn of the Dead:  Jan the d0uche reporter: ""Wait, maybe we should find some shopping mall or something.""  Agent Reyes: ""It'd be too hard to secure. And believe me, they would get in anyway.""Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head (and, I guess, a SPOILERS alert):  In the midst of fleeing the zeds, folks will insist on having meaningful discussions  snapping necks shouldn't kill zombies because the brain isn't affected (but it works in this movie)  Yes, absolutely, a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds  Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because, quote, ""I need to get out!""  Lovin' the prisoner's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds (who are still blocked by that desk)  Living legend, ex CIA, 20 years in the field, Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm. Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.  When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground (sunbathing?) in almost perfectly spaced order, Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of, say, around them.  A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas. How? By removing his gas mask.  So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we don't see her anymore.  Stick around for a mid credits scene to see what happens to the reporter. It's a lazy nod to the opening sequence of Lucio Fulci's cljazzic Zombi 2 (1979).",The first ever Serbian zombie movie - and it's crap,1396915200,"04 8, 2014"

"&#8220;V H S&#8221; is a found footage anthology that comprises six horror shorts: &#8220;Tape 56&#8221; &#8220;Amateur Night&#8221; &#8220;Second Honeymoon&#8221; &#8220;Tuesday the 17th&#8221; &#8220;The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger&#8221; and &#8220;10 31 98.&#8221; Actually, &#8220;Tape 56&#8221; is a &#8220;frame story&#8221; (directed by Adam Wingard, &#8220;You&#8217;re Next&#8221;) that links other five short movies &#8211; five short horrors that are mildly entertaining but not exactly scary.Let us forget the film&#8217;s contrived premise.

What they found is a dead body and a stack of old VHS tapes.That&#8217;s silly, but still OK. Sadly, what follows is not really impressive, either.

"The balls on the creators of this show are as big as I've seen since... I dunno, Viva Laughlin, or Glee maybe. When I say this show is a musical, though, I don't mean like those two, where you have the characters singing whatever song from the last 40 years that works in this particular situation, but a wholly original creation (with all of the good and bad things that entails). You don't end up having stupid things like a character singing a slow, ""moving"" cover of Girls Just Want to Have Fun (ask the Glee fans about that), or... well anything that happened in Viva Laughlin, because the songs are written to what the characters are thinking, so you have the inner monologue moments that come with having a musical; the characters emotions truly come out in the songs. Needless to say, if you have a show that relies on newly written songs that much, it would help if they didn't suck, which is the unfortunate hole that Browsers has fallen into. Even Bebe Neuwerth, the original Morticia Addams on Broadway, among many others, couldn't save the song she was given, which gleefully finds a whole bunch of things to rhyme with *Word I Cannot Say in Amazon Reviews*, while failing on a level as a song, and really not doing a good job of telling us about the character. It's a shame she's not used more, as she's channeling Ariana Huffington by way of Portia DeRossi's character in Better Off Ted (look at that costume), but leaning in to neither of them. The other four leads are some variation on a stock comic character, the Rachel Berry, the Stoned, Weird, Net Friendly Asian, The Awkward Dork, and The Organized, Righteous Black Man. They each get a song (save the latter), each song is uniquely bad in it's own way. Mercifully, they're all much shorter.The plot points are all very familiar, the characters are all very familiar, and the show does nothing with them because it takes time to tell in a few minutes what it could tell in 30 seconds, and the normal saving grace of the musical, catchy, emotion rending songs, are not there.

The court room scenarios are first rate, not heavy handed or arduous as is so often the case with such dramas from the US, and I enjoy seeing criminal life without guns.  When all is said and done, the complicated family relationships, the complicated female relationships and the complicated colleague relationships, the law is the thing.

"For anyone as tired, tired, sick and tired, tired and sick of cop shows and reality shows, there was no better palate cleanser than Reno 911   which reveled in being politically incorrect in every way that it is possible to be politically incorrect. I actually suspect the creators sent out exploratory expeditions to other galaxies and dimensions in order to discover hitherto unknown means of offending on every level. Reno 911 brought improvisation to such anarchic and manic levels so as to bring back fond memories of parodies like ""Top Secret!"" and ""Police Squad!"" If a gag fell flat, not to worry, there were about six or seven more coming along right on top of it, at least half of them guaranteed to smack the funny bone dead center. Like ""Top Secret!"" and ""Police Squad"" the humor was character based: unlike those examples, Reno 911 boasted a generous jazzortment of regulars and reoccurring characters. Alas, three deputies were dispatched in a mjazzive explosion which ended season 5, and season 6 fell a bit flat in comparison to what went before, but there are moments, such as the firing of an antique cannon at a memorial service, which winds up demolishing a squad car in a somewhat unexpected fashion. Another highlight is the discovery of ancient tapes of the deputies   affording a look at the characters some twenty years previously, including Lt. Dangle actually wearing long pants, and Deputy Wiegal with long hair. It also emerges that Wiegal is brain damaged (from an explosion in an apparent crack house), which explained a lot about her character. And Terry the roller skating prostitute tries to run for political office ... mmm   comments on that topic would practically write themselves.Extras include some outtakes, which would hardly be missed, and a pair of character sketches on the two new regulars. And I would seriously like to know how this show actually goes down among the sheriff's departments in Reno and Sparks, Nevada; one hopes they can bring themselves to be good sports about it.","A Little Flat, But Still Has Moments",1269043200,"03 20, 2010"

"This review was written only after having watched the pilot.The Blacklist has been set up as a mashup of Silence of the Lambs and Alias. We get creepy genius criminal in custody James Spader (a la Hannibal Lecter) insisting on spilling what he knows only to a young female FBI ingenue with this one being a much prettier alternative to Jodie Foster.  The interplay is similar but with the added component that Spader already knows all about her, a likely set up to his secretly being her father. (Shades of Star Wars)But Silence of the Lambs was done in 1991.  A knock off like this would feel more relevant if it had been done 20 years ago. As it is now, it feels old and stale.  The next component is the TV show Alias starring Jennifer Garner as done by JJ Abrams with a kick jazz female trying to integrate her exciting government agent life with her everyday family life, plus the turns and twists of the girl's personal relationships and people not being who they seem.  Alias debuted in 2001 so at least we're getting closer. This part of the concept is *only* a dozen years gone by.The show is watchable in part because of the casting of the two leads, James Spader and Megan Boone is fair. And it will probably be considered a hit, but mostly because of how dumb and awful most network TV is.  You'll have to suspend your disbelief mightily though with regards to this portrayal of the inner workings of the FBI which looks and feels fake...another thing it has in common with that old trod ground called Alias. And notably the casting of Harry Lennix as the guy in charge at the FBI doesn't ring true but it does follow the current New State Religion where TV and movie fiction goes out of its way to cast black actors in positions of authority in which they never are in real life.",Feels Old But Will Probably Do Well,1379980800,"09 24, 2013"

"&#8220;TITANIC meets GLADIATOR with a volcano!&#8221;That&#8217;s the way that some folks have described , recently released to home video by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.I can&#8217;t really disagree with that basic jazzessment, nor can I dispute the fact that, upon the film&#8217;s theatrical release earlier this year, neither the press reviews nor the movie&#8217;s box office were anything to get excited about.  On the other hand, I found the movie to be quite entertaining.Certainly POMPEII is no cljazzic.  The basic love story is filled with clich&eacute;s, mirroring Titanic, except that in this instance the characters are trying to escape an erupting volcano rather than a sinking ship.  The action sequences are well staged and exciting and the CGI recreation s of ancient Pompeii, the climactic eruption, earthquake and tsunami are truly spectacular.  In other words, this movie is fun.Kit Harington stars as a slave turned super gladiator, who falls in love with the daughter (Emily Browning) of a wealthy Pompeii merchant.  She is being wooed by a corrupt Roman Senator (Kiefer Sutherland), and he just happens to be the man who, years ago, killed Harington&#8217;s parents.  As Mount Vesuvius erupts, destroying everyone and everything in the vicinity, Harington must fight his way out of the gladiator&#8217;s arena, so that he can rescue Browning from Sutherland&#8217;s grasp.Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson, the epic film&#8217;s splendid cast includes Carrie Anne Moss, Adewale  Akinnouoye Agbaje, Jessica Lucas, Jared Harris and Currie Graham.The 2 disc 3D Blu Ray Digital combo set from Sony includes many extras: filmmaker&#8217;s audio commentary, 20 deleted and alternate scenes, plus several &#8220;Behind the Scenes&#8221; featurettes that cover virtually all aspects of the production (e.g. special effects, casting, production design, costuming, etc.).

"I grew up with the old ""The Celts"" series on PBS many years ago.  It was my first introduction to Enya's music and loved the series.  I also tuned in to a pseudo ""news"" show that reported on ancient history as news.  Meaning that they sent ""reporters"" in period clothing to battle scenes and historical events.  I forget the name of that show but it also ran on PBS for one or two seasons.  So here we are with ""The Vikings"" and seeing elements of those shows is so refreshing.  Having unfamiliar actors is such a treat since I often look for German and Scandinavian films just for that reason.  Mr. Byrne is just fine as the bad guy, but he does not get in the way of a great series.  Anyway, this is a show with great acting and a great story.  If it looks like we're skimming over the bad side of the Vikings (the slaves and the raiding),  I don't really care.  If these guys had gotten to the New World instead of Columbu several hundred years later, we would be better off now. History was written by the men with the most swords and the time to do it better was then.  So this show gives us ""what if"" speculators are lot to look forward to.

"Thank you, Amazon, for portraying a middle to upper cljazz Jewish family in a dirty, gritty, yucky way.  Which next ethnic stereotype are you going to break?  Asians?  Are you going to do a series where they aren't cast as smart?I was drawn to this because of Jeffrey Tambor who always plays quirky characters with gusto.  He did not fail in his gusto for playing an advanced, middle aged, bald man who is either a cross dresser and or wants to transition from male to female.  The three adult children are all freaky and creepy.  I didn't like this for the same reason I didn't like the movie, &#34;August: Osage County&#34;    while the acting was superb, watching a really brewed up family was beyond weary.Personally, I want shows that make me laugh (The Millers), make me happy (Glee), feel original (Seinfeld) (Glee), inform me (Jon Stewart), impress me with their acting (Big Bang Theory) (3rd Rock from the Sun).  This did none of the above.  I really don't want to see a married woman lusting for her college lesbian lover.  I don't want to see the son disrespecting women and doing whatever freaky thing that was alluded to in the mystery surprise scene.

"This is a very creative, clever and funny show for children and adults alike.  Highly entertaining. There is nothing inappropriate. It is difficult to put into words how great the show is. It is ironic because the show has sounds from the characters but no words, the facial and body expressions alone convey what is happening. This is a clay animation production from England. They also created Wallace and Grommet. Although I think Sean the sheep is funnier and does not have such serious life experiences like W&G movies. Also they have another show called Timmy Time, which is a spinoff of Shaun the sheep. It is about Timmy the baby lamb going to school. It is really entertaining as well. Really good stuff. They also have websites that you can watch videos and play games. If you have never watched it, just watch it!

"A group of vandals   thieves   videographers break into a house in order to steal a specific VHS tape. Once inside, they find the place empty, except for one room. In this room is a stack of televisions, a VCR, and an old man in a chair. This forms the wrap around story for the events on a tape already in the VCR. VIDEO ONE has a trio of drunken pervs, out to secretly record their sexual exploits. The tables are turned on them, and they become human prey. VIDEO TWO is about a young couple on vacation. Their trip soon becomes a nightmare when someone enters their room while they sleep. On VIDEO THREE,  a group of four hikers are out for a serene walk through the woods. Unfortunately, someone   something is out to ruin their little nature walk. VIDEO FOUR is a gruesome, supernatural story told over several days, via internet video. It's a cautionary tale that is best summed up in the words, &#34;Trust no one&#34;.  VIDEO FIVE  concerns four guys and a Halloween party. Things fly out of control, and the four are plunged into a demonic night of death.  As the burglars watch the tape, they slowly realize that things are not as they appear, and that they are in big trouble.

"While this is not the best of the pilots it does have a certain watchability that some of the other pilots are lacking from the bunch. The acting was believable and the characters were vastly different from each other. Sometimes in a tv show characters with a semi large cast seem to blend together, but here they are distinct with their own personalities and focuses. You can also see the seeds being sown for possibilities if it is picked up for series, such as certain characters being involved in romances. The other nice thing is that it didn't feel like a rip off of shows like &#34;Glee&#34; or &#34;Smash&#34; because it had a more &#34;Broadway&#34; sound then either of those shows ever could have, especially with the fantastic Bebe in a role.

"This is a review for Amazon Instant Video on Moonlight. Compared to the series, you do not miss much here when it is this or DVD. You have some extras but they are not that much or that often, and they are normally interviews and nothing more. For that reason, i think it works out.Moonlight is a story about Mick St. James and a human he has a past with. In the pilot there is a ""vsaampire killing"" case Mick looks into, and this is something that Mick finds dangerous. Apparently vampires have their way of living and concealing, and they do not like attention. This rleationshiip continues on through the show, and this and another one will come to define it.As far as a show on the supernatural, i liked it. It had a lot and it even allowed people to do things that a lot of shows seem to miss out on. The efffects, while not amazing, are great, and the acting was a lot better than anything I expected. Honestly, i thought the show might scream timber and fall a few episodes in but it kept the season going and it answers a lot. We get to know Mick, vamps, some humans, an a weird experiment that is going on.Its worth watching.As with all shows, there are filler episodes as well. That can be one of the great things about this, because you do not have to wathc everything. Still, missing is missing and this, a 5 5 show that is still hanging around, might find you enjoying it.It is hard not to.","Wards, Rewards, and Childhood Creams",1302393600,"04 10, 2011"

"There may be spoilers.In a role Richard Gere was meant to play, Robert Miller is an investment tycoon who loses his way, both with his family and his business.  Miller has hedged a financial deal that invests in a Russian copper mine.  When the Ruskies hold up the currency transfer, Miller has to borrow $400 million to make the books look right for a pending sale of his company.  When the guy who lent him the dough wants it back, Miller desperately tries to close the deal before the fraud is discovered.  That is just the beginning of his problems.His daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) is also a senior officer in the company and starts to smell smoke coming from the cooked books.  Miller's wife Ellen (Susan Sarandon) heads the charity wing of the company and suspects Robert is having an affair...which of course he is.  Now it really gets interesting.  Miller had invested in an art gallery run by a young French beauty (Laetitia Casta).Driving to a late night of romance in Julie's (Casta) car, Miller dozes off and flips the car killing Julie.  Miller survives with bruised ribs, calls a friend to pick him up and attempts to cover up his involvement.  Tim Roth plays a detective who for some reason suspects Miller was in the car.  This never made much sense to me.  There was no proof but all of a sudden Miller is the chief suspect in leaving the scene of the accident.All of these story lines conflate around Miller's financial woes.  Director and screenwriter Nicholas Jarecki meanders a bit and certainly the film has a few holes, but Gere's performance is a good one, making the film worthy of a look.",3 1/2 stars for a fine performance by Richard Gere,1358121600,"01 14, 2013"

"""I'm not the same man you chased away all those years ago. Find my daughter!"" Years after he left Damascus under suspicious circumstances, Adib Abdel Kareem (Siddig) returns when he finds out that his daughter has gone missing. When he meets people from his past he is forced not only to confront his earlier life consequences but also find his daughter before its too late. This is a movie that is good, fast moving and worth watching, but also a little generic. There really isn't much to say about this one. Father finds out his daughter is missing, he is forced to seek help from those he has had previous problems with, encounters resistance. I did like the movie and I do think it's worth watching and while it is pretty tense I found that the daughter storyline seemed to have gotten lost in the jumble of what was going on.

"Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, what could go wrong?  The ending, that's what. Folks could rate this movie 1 5 stars based on their likes, interests, their taste in ""film"", blah, blah, blah.  It held my attention, it was mildly tense throughout the movie, but the end feels like rape.  Rape of my time and attention.  Only one time in my life have I taken note of a director... that was M. Night Shyamalan.  Sixth Sense was amazing and all my years of critiques, editing, writing, and reading, that one movie was one that caught me entirely unprepared, but satisfied.  But then, his constant and consistent failure since has convinced me to avoid anything he participates in.  Now, for the second time in my long life, a director has caught my attention. Nicholas Jarecki for Arbitrage.  Should his name ever come to my attention again I will avoid the product related to him.  All my life I've studied writing, editing, entertaining in creative forms as a matter of a love for it. Stephen King, very well loved, doesn't cross my desk after years of horrible ""non"" endings.  I'm inclined to writers like Dean Koontz and J. Michael Straczynski... people who appreciate their audiences and don't play idiocy with them. They have the guts to write a climax that leads to a sensible conclusion that satisfies the consumer.  If you think ""Highly praised"" aka ""art"" or ""artistic"" is ""just wonderful"", then waste your life watching movies like this one. Better still, find a foreign film where you can read the closed captions and miss the acting for your entertainment... personally, I would prefer a book if I have to read. You have to take this review based on its title, Instant Review... I rarely get upset unless my valuable time is infringed upon.  If you don't mind being moderately entertained for around 100 minutes and then going to the bathroom and missing the whole climax and conclusion, you'll like this film.  I can't give zero stars, one star would insult the 95 or so minutes of great acting and tension you'd expect from 'drama'.

"You know how The Wire: The Complete Series starts out slow but in the end everything comes together and you realize that you've watched the greatest show on television? This is the opposite case. Call it theTrue Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)effect. Every episode is exciting and drives the show forward. Every episode has something cool that keeps you watching to the next one. And the title sequence? VERY cool.Yet when it's over, you'll feel like you've just wasted 13 hours. It's not so much that the whole thing falls apart at the end due to the stupid denouement of the major mystery (although the answer as to why Rose Byrne comes into a police station all bloody with a dead boyfriend in her bathtub is very stupid) but also because once it's over all of the missteps in the piece become glaringly obvious. When you are watching it, you just enjoy Glen Close and Ted Danson at their crazy manipulative best. Glen Close is in pure bunny boiling evil form (and she does kill the dog) and Ted Danson is like a version of Sam gone to pot without conscience. The games that these two (and Danson's lawyer) play to one up each other are particularly amusing and convoluted.Sadly, once it's over the plot holes become way too obvious. A simple malfeasance case is probably too dull to sustain an entire show, but in one episode, Glen Close manipulates one of her own witnesses to lie in deposition in order to ruin her case and make the Danson camp think that they are winning. In another episode Close kills a dog which I believe might be problematic even for lawyers. And Ted Danson openly talking to one of the people suing him in order to manipulate the lawsuit is just dumb all around. And if we enjoy watching Glen Close be evil, why do the writers think that we need to see her crying like at the end ofDangerous LiaisonsBut really, the entire thing falls on Rose Byrne's tiny shoulders and Rose Byrne is just not up to the task. Yes, she's supposed to be a naive lawyer just out of law school but most of the time she comes off as utterly stupid. When her jazzistant ruins all of her appointments and messes up her day, she has to wait the entire episode to fire him. And it's supposed to be some kind of fall from grace when she's no longer a nice person. Partially it's the problem of the scripts. She is supposed to be naive, but most of the time the scripts make her act like an utter idiot. But mostly, it's Rose Byrne's fault. When Glen Close is telling her that she admires her because she is very shrewd, well there's nothing all that shrewd about her. Even though, it's obvious that she's been hired in order to get to a witness, there's nothing about her acting that suggests that she's anything other than a vacant and pretty face to be manipulated. This is Mary Sue characterization at it's worse. She has nothing to offer, yet everyone claims that she offers the world. And if this is a woman who comes from hardscrabble circumstances who clawed her way to the top of her law school cljazz and can turn down a 130K starting salary, we SHOULD believe that she's actually intelligent and shrewd and just as much of a force of nature as Glen Close. She SHOULD be Glen Close's chaacter in process.Instead she's just dumb. Sure, it's fun watching Glen Close push her around and play with her like a tiger playing with a bunny rabbit; but if the script is telling us that she's this amazing lawyer learning how to be a manipulative powerhouse, then that potential should be obvious. Yet it's not. And that's why overall, this thing fails.I'd recommend buying it if you watched a few episodes and liked it, but be prepared to be disappointed.

"REMASTERED set 5 is 8 Poirots. Belgian with `little gray cell' out sleuths `The Yard.' David Suchet made Poirot famous. Philip Jackson plays Chief Inspector Japp in last 5 episodes. Hastings (Hugh Fraser) Poirot's right hand is available for all but one episode. Miss Lemon (Pauline Moran) in 6 episodes. Agatha Christie stories always fantastic, but Suchet makes the film adaptations soar to new heights. Humor, scenic bliss, and costume lust rival the script writing. Poirot stories began a 1920s era.

In contrast to Arrested Development, however, the characters are not very well developed, and so I'm watching it with far less empathy than those in AD.  The lack of social empathy is more like 30 rock where only a few characters are singled out for elaboration but they are so over caricatured and ancillary that they are unrelatable as humans: in Ted this is the zany scientists and cold ceo and in 30 rock Jenna, Tracy, the paige and the writing staff.",Funny take on Monsanto,1335225600,"04 24, 2012"
"When I was surfing the prime video I came across this show and thought ""COOL"" maybe this one will bring some much needed hard proof facts to the screen on the paranormal!Well, the first episode with the MIT engineer using his knowledge to find a reason for the hauntings in his building was more of what I was looking for in a series based on the unexplained. So far that has been the only segment that showed promise in either debunking or proving that there is paranormal activity around us.The rest of the episodes that I've watched so far are VERY easy to explain ( orbs = dust particles, insects or fibers pet hair reflecting off of the light, floating apparitions = breath condensation outdoors, furniture moving and snoring or growling noises in abandoned home = feral cat or wild animal using home for shelter, the golden ghost in the window = flashlight (backlighting) shinning onto only curtain in the house and so on. As with most of the other shows the power of suggestion plays a huge role in most if not all of these stories and clouds the judgment of many of the victims, friends and family members.In episode 7 My Ghost Stories#3 The segment on the Gentleman's Club (stripper bar) was clearly a hoax used to drum up much needed interest in the failing bar. Most of the floating images around the outdoor cameras are moths (the wings can be seen flapping and the flight patterns are typical of moths) yet the bar's owner states that they are not and were verified not to be insects. The security company wasn't brought in to confirm or deny the claims nor was the local media present or questioned as to what their findings were. WHY? Most if not all of the stories do not present calibrating stories when either the media or security companies were involved in the investigations. Again WHY NOT if these people are saying on camera they have calibrating evidence, then prove it other than showing newspaper clips that can't be read.The production values are good including narration, some of the camers work as well as image quality and choice of locations. The show doesn't really stand out against the other better known shows, but is entertaining enough to keep me watching to see if there are more good segments like in the very first episode.","""SOMETHING MISSING HERE""",1398816000,"04 30, 2014"

"The film opens with excessive amount of background material, but not enough to explain the events, just that there is a haunted house with an old tube machine that still works which allows the user to converse with the dead in case they can't spell on a Ouija Board. A new family moves into the house which basically mirrors the old one.The film then centers on the oldest son Evan (Harrison Gilbertson) and his newly acquired playmate and seer Samantha (Liana Liberato) to the unfortunate exclusion of everyone else. On the plus side, the build up was fairly decent with fleeting glimpses of moving figures and the past. At one point during the film, I did get a chill, something that is rare treat.On the negative side was the narration of Jacki Weaver as Janet Morello. Her hair was done in a Zelda Rubenstein fashion and she used her small voice as if to imitate her. I think the film would have worked better without the narration. The other characters were never developed or really used in this haunting manner.

"This was actually a theatrical release. And in 3d , I  have the 3d version from Europe. (you need a all region player to watch it that way though) and this should have been released in 3d blu ray here too. It was shot in 3d and at the filmhouses in 3d too. But like the hole we only got the 2d version. I will say that in 3d this looks really good and it's native 3d! SO it's just got a great picture.  Most people saw this in 2d which sucks!. The film is a very low budget affair. WIth minimum effects , and it concerns a haunted apartment.  People don't give this one a break but unlike most horror films this one spares no one. So the evil wins, which is very rare in horror cinema!  The scene where a character is thrown from the window and falls is very well done and looks outstanding in 3d.  The rest of the effects are just the bare minimum. But there is nothing wrong with the acting as some have said. They do a good job here. Rebecca de morney plays a dysfunctional mom, here, and it's good that she's acting , she's still great looking in her fifties too.  This is a ok little budget horror film. That is basically a haunted house flick, but at least it's native 3d.

I really don't have a vested interest in any of the characters at this point (like I did with ""Morgan"" when he first appeared in TWD). Also, I don't like the continual flashbacks. Other viewers may enjoy it, but the flow is slightly weird to me. On a separate note, I applaud Amazon for offering this on a ""pay as you go"" plan.

"Orlando Bloom stars as Dr. Martin Blake, a first year resident under the supervision of Chief Resident Waylans (Rob Morrow).  Blake is loner who has a hard time mixing with the staffers.  He has no friends and lives in a stark but kind of cool apartment.  An 18 year old girl comes under his care with a treatable urinary infection.  Diane (Riley Keough) has a boyfriend but when they appear to be breaking up, confides in Dr. Blake.  He is smitten with young Diane.When she is released, her family invites Blake over for dinner.  Their motives appear to be one of thanks but to also prompt a romance between Blake and Diane's older sister who is on the make.  Certainly a doctor will do just fine.  Blake has other ideas.  He's only interested in Diane.  Upon a return visit to pick up a gift basket they had prepared (way too many coincidences in this film) he excuses himself to the bathroom where he alters Diane's medication which lands her back in the hospital.Through a series of inexplicably easy access to medication and IV bags, Blake manages to keep Diane hospitalized, to what end I don't know.  I guess the guy is just crazy.  Playing against type, Bloom gives a creepy good performance.  His character has obvious moral conflicts.  What he's doing seems acceptable to him but the filmmakers never explain why.  At the same time, he's outraged when one of the orderlies makes crude sexual advances toward the staff and patients.  The orderly (Michael Pena) is also a pretty obvious drug user.I don't know where this hospital is but I sure never want to go there.  Evidently they have no security, no cameras and lax supervision.  The film also stars award winning actors Taraji P. Henson as the head nurse and J. K. Simmons as a police detective.  Unfortunately neither is given much to do.  Certainly the film had an opportunity to be something more, but when it ends I don't know what it was all supposed to mean.

"I'm tempted to give this thing a better review than it deserves because it has a good actor in the lead and there are very few westerns made these days. But I think the best this film rises to is ""ok"". Its not good or bad. Its just ok.Sam Shepard plays a Butch Cjazzidy who survives in south america into old age. There are flashbacks along the way covering how things went in Bolivia. The film quickly turns into an outlaws on the run western. And as that, its not bad. Everything seems to have been done on a tight budget but they did good with what they had.What the film is missing is any sort of big action scene. Its all little stuff. Its a movie about outlaws where there are no robberies on screen. There is a detective character in the film who has been chasing Cjazzidy for years. But his character is underdeveloped.The flashback covering what happened to the Sundance Kid is pointlessly disturbing. Its not what most people want to see in a western.And the films attempt to create a moral (really political) distinction between ""good"" crime and ""bad"" crime falls really flat.The films greatest flaw is the lack of an ending. Its as if they ran out of money and just stopped everything one day. The film just stops dead and the credits start. Anything would have been better than what they did.It is a nice looking film. The got the look, feel and ground features of Bolivia sort of right. It didn't end up looking like a generic nowhere western location. Sam Shepard's performance was good but limited by the script and the acting ability of those he was working with. Shepard needed someone else to play off in the film.

"Here we have your standard creature feature with nearly every cliched element represented. You've got a group of cocky youngsters in a lake where there's no cell phone reception. You've got a curious mismatch of personalities, from the creepy loner to the blonde tease to the nerdy filmmaker wannabe and (of course) the alpha male joke. I mean, jock. You've even got a wizened old man who warns them about impending danger (they ignore the old fart, natch). Watch as they take a row boat into the middle of a lake and begin getting picked off, one by one, by some kind of giant, carnivorous fish.Let's start with the only thing that works. I almost gave this movie one star but I decided not to solely because of the performances. These kids aren't portraying any group of seniors you'd ever want to know in real life, but at least they threw themselves into their roles wholeheartedly. The majority of them did pretty decent jobs, so kudos to the cast. It's too bad that the writing and directing were so completely inept that it turned the acting into frosting on a turd cake.This is not to say the characters were any good. You've got Johnny, the morose moron who actually knew about the fish and didn't try to stop his so called friends as they gadded about in the water. He spends 90% of his screen time sulking, scowling, and pouting for no real reason. It looked for all the world like they cast him just to give the film a poor man's replica of another Johnny    Depp. Watch him emote! And demonstrate a total lack of responsibility or skill! There's the nebbish Zeke, who spends the bulk of the film either pitying or glorifying himself. There's three other people, including that blonde who is just plain enough to flirt shamelessly with everyone. The end result: they're all horrible jerks.I blame the script. The film is trying to make a point, believe it or not, about how loyalties and friendship can be strained when death is on the line, but it makes the point in a bumbling and repetitive way. Plus, given that every single one of these people is despicable and annoying, there's absolutely no ""will they won't they"" tension to the story. In fact, roughly forty minutes into the film I found my allegiances changing over to the fish. ""Hurry up, fish,"" I thought. ""What are you waiting for?"" Instead of providing some kind of sympathetic figure to give the tale forward momentum, you've got people yelling and crying and endangering each others' lives for no reason other than because it's dramatic. Or supposed to be.Speaking of forward momentum, let's talk about how it takes five healthy kids something like ten hours to paddle a boat approximately two to three hundred yards to shore. The film wants you to feel like they're trapped in the middle of this lake (the fish quickly dispatches of their oars, but only because they idiotically use them to jab at the thing whenever it gets near), but it seems highly unlikely, since we are shown that the stuff they throw out of the boat (junk food, etc.) washes up on the shore hours before the end of the film. Even if you accept that the boat is somehow in a dead zone, they come up with the bright idea to vote people off the boat to distract the fish so that they can then paddle with their hands to the shore. The first time they do this, it buys them a paltry thirty seconds of time. But they keep doing it, over and over, and    what a shock    it never gets them anywhere.With a concept like this, viewers will be astonished less by the B grade effects of the fish (when it's underwater, it seems pretty well done, but it surfaces enough times for you to sense that it's a glorified balloon) or by the violent turns these friends make, and more by how everything is essentially the result of stupid people being stupid. That's only good cinema if you're making a comedy. Sometimes B grade horrors like this can be so bad they're funny, but such is not the case here. The film is a joke, for certain, but it takes itself so seriously that it inspires less friendly enjoyment and more irritated head shakes. If they remade it from the fish's point of view, it would probably be silly enough to be good times, but as it is, it's nothing but fairly talented young actors pouring their hearts out for weak, watery schlock.",Bottom Feeding,1374710400,"07 25, 2013"

This series was entertaining to a point.  The altruistic theme was a little too thick and tended to slow the real plot.  The altruistic line always bogs down the story and seems to always take up so much of the air time the viewer gets bored and wants to leave the show!  Other than that it was worth the time spent to watch!  The theme and plot were well written and acted out.  The amateur spy aspect played just right as to enhance the historical setting and events.  Conflict was abundant and helped overcome the altruistic bog.,Island at War,1371168000,"06 14, 2013"

"I loved this show from the first season. However. this seven and final season, collected in this dvd set,  seemed disjointed, over played  and lost direction of the original show's concept. I know every good show has to change, but this went a total 360 and tried to alienate its fans with this season's grittier edge.. Micheal's deep undercover mission would have been great for another show, not for Burn Notice. Show creator and producer Matt Nix just went too far off the basic concept and its showsThe cast was and is amazing.This is one great reason to get this set. The acting is never better. Jeffrey Donovan as Micheal Weston leads this cast so well. Gabrielle Anwar (Fi),Bruce Campbell (Sam), Sharon Gless (Maddy), and Coby Bell ( Jesse) blend so great together.The highlight of this season is the casting of John Pyper Ferguson who is larger than life villian,  James Kendrick. When he is on screen, his powerful and hypnotic presents compells you to watch. His character is only in six episodes, you can wish he was in moreThe fatal twist is a death is the last episode of a beloved character to save the rest of the group. I felt the death of unneeded and was a waste. It is an emotional turning point in the final episode, this  after last year death of Micheal's brother Nate . This character unselfish act is something you would not see coming, since all these character have cheated death all seven seasons.One note, with only one commentary of the forget me not episode makes me wish they did a few more commentary, especially since this was the show's final season.This is one show I would love , in five years,  to see a reunion movie and find out where many of these character are.RIP Burn Notice ..you were great escapist TB for seven season..ThanksBennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",The Final Season,1394323200,"03 9, 2014"

"This movie is a me too movie attempting to capitalize off the success of pseudo histories such as Robin Hood and Arthur. My first objection to the movie is the font they chose to write the subtitles, locations, and plot points. It was difficult to read on my analog TV, especially when they opt for white on a pale blue background using an ancient looking font that is difficult to decipher in the first place. Now the reason why we have subtitles is for the Picts, who are native of Northern Britain. They don't speak English, but the Romans speak 21st century English, including one soldier with a British accent. ""Sorry mate, but orders are orders,"" he says as he slices a Pict throat. OH PLEASE! If the Picts don't speak modern English, don't try to make it realistic with subtitles only to have the Romans speak English. The language spoken by the Picts is actually unknown.A Roman governor wanting to make a name for himself, opts to send the 9th Roman legion into the Pict stronghold in order to kill their king. The Roman governor uses a female Pict slave (whose parents were murdered by Romans, with her being raped as a child and her tongue cut out) to guild them into Pict territory. Guess how that works out Scooby Doo? The ninth legion is wiped out except for the general who is taken captive and 7 Romans (who look more like an international group). They opt to do the stupid thing and attempt to rescue the general in the heart of a Pict camp. After they fail at that, they are hunted by Picts. For those who like killing, blood, urine, and violence this is your film. The overly simplistic plot, lack of good characterization, making us identify with the bad guys who we know will lose, poor attempts at humor, makes this the least enjoyable of the pseudo histories to date. They spent a lot of money making this film and wasted it on an inferior script.The story of the missing ninth Roman legion being destroyed by the Picts is legend. It actually got transferred to Judea.","NO HISTORIANS ON THE SET, PLEASE!",1289606400,"11 13, 2010"

"I love the actors in this version. I get more invested in the show each season. There are a lot of twists which, I guess, would come from having ghost, vampires and werewolves all packed into one show in leading roles. That sounds as though it could be overwhelming and dark. Which, if the writing failed, it would be. However the writing holds up, the actors work well with each and the show has a family, albeit a strange one, feel to it. There is enough reality blended with fantasy that makes it work. The bits of comedy sprinkled throughout keeps it from getting too dark.

"So, spoiler alert, some new cast members. I wasn't sure I was going to like it but ended up having some rousing fun. Was it like the first 2 seasons? No. The first 2 seasons had a really tight knit crew with very human dynamics. You were always kept on edge not only by the actual animals from the anomalies but also from trying to figure out what the spin was between the characters. Now, with a different leader on the crew, the dynamics really changed. I found myself laughing at some of the outrageous actions taking place. Yes, some laughing at the absolute impossibility of the situation in which they found themselves (read as &#34;ridiculous, foolish, unbelievable, what were they thinking?) But, also, some really good laughs involving the dynamics of the crew and other characters. In this case, I really had a rip roaring good time  Danny is a complete smart mouth and has a major attitude problem with authority, which he makes no attempt to hide.

"The film begins with a young man wandering down a large, Mexican thoroughfare with a stricken expression on his face. A mjazzive carnival    fireworks, puppets, costumes, crowded frivolity    billows around him as he stops and asks, over and over, where he can get a boat. Everyone points him down the street a ways. He wanders in that direction for a bit before stopping to ask yet another person. Over and over. Finally he finds a man in a bar who agrees to rent him his personal boat that he uses for work. The man goes back to his motel room (and pregnant wife) pleased. The next day, he finds the man at the dock, and without making any kind of real arrangements    no paperwork, no discussion about where he's going, no ID, just a wad of cash handed over    the couple takes the boat and sails off into some seriously bombastic opening credits, the kind that think volume is a good substitute for craft.I'm not sure what the point of this very drawn out, very misleading intro was meant to be, but it neatly summarizes a lot of what's wrong with this film. It has a broken ankle pacing, too much information is left out and what isn't is both repetitive and misleading, and never is there a real sense of who these people are, what they want to do, and what's going on around them. It gets worse when they land on an island that appears to be populated only by children of sinister intent.I'll grant you, the bones of the story aren't too shabby. In abler hands    with stronger dialogue, more believable characters, and kids that can actually act    the film could've been quite a thrill. It's just that the movie has nothing more going for it than its central concept, which is really just a kernel of what it should be. None of the concepts or ideas that surround it are explored. No real lessons are learned. Even when people are (ostensibly) running for their lives, it feels like nothing is at stake. Perhaps that's because the editing is so choppy, or the soundtrack is so inconsistent and in your face, or the characters are so featureless, or the attempts at gore and shock are mostly just intrusive and laughable.

He was addicted by free samples given out at a state fair...a few chews, or as few as fifty cigarettes can produce a lifetime addiction...painfully shortened.Product placement is still a great media issue and Big Tobacco is still there, trying to induce children to fill their ever emptying ranks of dying addicts...it's how they work.Tobacco has appeared twice as much in media available to children over the past two years than it had for several years in the past.

"May be spoilers below.Ok, I saw this show on our menu one day.  I thought it, like the movie was based on real events.  While watching last night, my mom looked it up and it turns out that it is fiction.  I only started because I thought it was real stuff.So, I liked this show.  That is until the point came in which they jumped ahead.  The guy was no longer a cop, his wife is pregnant, the one guy is popular now and the killer has white hair.  It just made us feel like we had missed an entire season.  Then it started to get crazy.  It was all murder.  It almost turned into a comedy.The addition of Key and Peele hurt it as well.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong they are hilarious.  But, I kept thinking I was about to see a comedy set.  Messed up the feeling of the show.  It is like they decided to just add random stuff to the story.The worst part though, the absolute worst part was the final episode.  My god, it made this entire series pointless.  I just sat there and stared at my TV.  I thought, no way this is how they will end this show.  But, they did.  Makes everything one hundred percent pointless.  I do not want to give anything away.  But, if you watch you will more than likely agree with me.  Good show, got stupid, turned ridiculous, ended awfully.My mom, stepfather and I all feel cheated out of the hours we wasted on this show.  There is no point in ever watching it again.  I would have given the first episodes of this a four out of five.  But, from the episode that jumped ahead until the last episode I would give them a 1.  Thus, I give the entire series a 2 out of 5.","What, in the name of hell just happened?",1403481600,"06 23, 2014"
"Summary:At a high tech lab in the artic, there has been a release of an unknown contaminant.  It is jazzumed to be a virus.  Somehow, the CDC is approached to come and help with the situation.  Dr. Walker was specifically requested.  (This appears to be an important fact, but we are not told why.)The company with the lab is hiding what they are working on.  They won't tell the CDC, and they are lying about not working on monkeys.  An infected monkey is found by one of the CDC doctors.The story actually starts out pretty good.  I have seen the first 3 episodes.  The acting is good with the exception of Dr. Doreen Boyle, actress Catherine Lemieux, who appears to be unable to pick an accent.  Is she British or Southern?  I can't decide, but neither can she.From a suspense and action stand point, the story is well written.  The infected people are angry and smart, and they have an irrational desire to infect others.  You never know when one of them will escape or reach out and grab you.  It is scary, suspenseful and a little bit gory.Most of the special effects, outside of the makeup, are more what you would expect from television.  Dr. Peter Farragut does an unbelievable Spiderman act where he bounds up into the ventilation.  The fighting mice are obviously CGI.  It isn't that bad though overall.  It is definitely acceptable to me, but it may not be to other people.There are hints of secrets that are untold.  There are two love triangles involving four people.  Eek!  Secrets like Dr. Hatake's contacts, Dr. Hatake's album full of pictures, are running throughout the story.  Dr. Peter's filmed secret hand signals, so his brother would know to run.  Who asked the CDC to come if Peter is telling them to run?  There are a lot more secret happenings.So why the 3 rating?Much of the science is just wrong as are the procedures.The air is safe because the rats mice? are alive and the PRC test is negative.  Let's start with the obvious, what is a PRC test?  There is no such animal in the virus detection world.  There is however a PCR test, Polymerase Chain Reaction test..  This is used to detect viruses.  And how was the sample used to detect that there is no airborne virus?  A test would require a sample from the breathing area of the victim, like a bronchial wash.  The best way to take a sample would be biosamplers, using an impinger, if you want the actual air.  Airborne means what is coming out of the mouth and nose, and we know that yucky, infected gunk is coming out of their mouths.  The fact that the rats are alive mean nothing, since we don't even know if they are infected.  I would suggest putting the breathing apparatus back on.The virus was checked to see if it was cylindrical?  I didn't know that they were cylindrical.  And why was there a picture of what appeared to be a rotavirus shown being infiltrated by a helical virus?Those procedures for the strong, violent infected were just wrong.  Once you know they can be violent, you strap them down and sedate them, so you can safely work with them.  You also don't leave one person alone with people who are likely to become violent unless they are strapped down and sedated.  The idea is to keep them safe, the medical science team safe, and the uninfected safe.  You don't just put them in a room and leave a member of the team alone in the middle of them.  Then after a team member is held hostage, you definitely don't repeat the same stupidity, but this show does it.EDIT:  I have now watched episodes 4 6.  The show seems to be employing the 'Lost' strategy.  There are more questions, more conspiracies, and I still don't have a clue about what is going on.  The only character I like at this point is Julia Walker.  I hope this show also doesn't go on forever without answering any of the questions it has raised.Edit:  I have now watched episodes 7 9.  People are switching sides like at a drop of a hat.  There isn't a lot apparent reasons for the side switches, except the company who owns the whole shebang is evil on a stick.  Major Sergio, who killed Dr. Doreen, is now A GOOD GUY.  The reason is he just feels bad about all the bad he has done.  He is a knight in shining armor.  And Dear (pick whatever you worship), I wasn't even surprised when Dr. Julia and Hatake had their ""Luke, I am your father moment"".Our newest mystery is why is this all being done for Julia.  With the overriding question, what in the heck are they doing for Julia?By the way, muriatic acid, ammonium nitrate, and potjazzium chloride are high unstable, explosive even.  This is what we are told in episode 9.  No, they aren't.  Ammonium nitrate might be if you heat it.  Ammonium nitrate and muriatic acid could create a rxn if combined, but I am clueless about the use of the potjazzium chloride.EDIT:  Episodes 10 11 and we still don't know what Hatake was doing, but we now know they are immortal.  And for the record, the removal of cerebral spinal fluid is not a death sentence.  It replenishes itself several times a day... is it 3 times... something like that.",It is not a zombie show.

"For the final season of ""Chuck"", producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge: how to generate new drama, comedy and romance for a great show.  After all, at the end of season four, nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski (Zachary Levy) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker (Yvonne Strahovski), after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother in law Captain Awesome.  Operation Bartkowski was officially ended, leaving Chuck, Sara, gruff NSA agent John Casey (Adam Baldwin), and Chuck's best friend Morgan (Joshua Gomez) without a mission.  The solution: reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov, last season's leading villain, Chuck, Sara, Casey, and Morgan go into the private spy business, only to discover the competition can be quite fierce.  Carrie Anne Moss (Matrix) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm, and as someone with a history, and maybe a future, with Casey.  Morgan, who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head, discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills, and in the process damages his relationship with Casey's daughter Alex.  Chuck, reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd, goes through his own period of painful adjustment, before having to face his greatest opponent one more time.  Sara Walker's long missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment, while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang, and to additional Bartkowski family comedy (and drama over Chuck and Sara's future).Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents, including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century, leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run.  In a tense multi episode conclusion, Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together.  The suspense will be good to the last drop.""Chuck: The Complete Fifth Season"" has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans.

"""You got me out of the darkness. You gathered me up from earth. You've brought me back to life."" Neil (Affleck) is an American who is traveling in Paris when he meets Marina (Kurylenko) a divorced mother with a ten year old daughter. Striking up a fast romance they both move back to Oklahoma. Not long after the move the relationship begins to stale and when her Visa expires Marina and her daughter return to Paris. When she moves back Neil reconnects with an old friend and they begin to fall in love, until Neil hears troubling news about Marina. I'm not going to lie, the only reason I can write that summary is because I read it off of IMDb.

"Very entertaining legal financial thriller with Richard Gere perfect as an unscrupulous, ethically challenged multimillionaire who on the eve of his sixtieth birthday sees his position as a great businessman and philanthropist turn increasingly precarious. His business empire was actually built on fraud committed to his investors, and the only solution he sees to avoid being caught for cooking the books is selling his company to a businessman that is playing hard to get. Even worse for him, her lover (Laetitia Casta) dies in a car accident while he was driving; he flees, but the police see him increasingly as a suspect for her murder, and a dogged detective (Tim Roth) will spare no stone in order to catch him. On the family side, his own daughter (Brit Marling) realizes he is a fraud; only his wife (Susan Sarandon) seems (alas, only seems) willing to stand by him. The film is fast and entertaining throughout.

"Kill List (Ben Wheatley, 2011)I have talked, over the years, a number of times about the importance of studios marketing their movies correctly, and how the mismarketing of a movie can lead to not one, but two related, major problems: the audience who should be seeing the movie not cottoning to its existence, and the audience who should not be seeing the movie (those it is being marketed to) sitting down with it, finding something entirely different than they were told they'd be getting, and absolutely hating it as a result. Between these two problems, the movie ends up becoming almost universally reviled, and then that first group, the ones who would probably get a great deal out of it, hear it sucks and never get there in the first place. I've used all my favorite whipping boys for this in recent reviews, so let me introduce you to an incredible Chicago filmmaker by the name of Ricardo Islas. Islas makes what I like to call aggressively indie films. They have no discernible budget, use sets that are just as ridiculous as those you find in Ulli Lommel and Uwe B&ouml;ll movies (though given Islas' budget, they make a lot more sense here), star a bunch of people you've never heard of, and are consistently marketed as horror movies. In some cases, that kind of makes sense; when you title one of your movies The Zombie Farm, you gotta figure someone's going to pick up on the fact that the movie contains zombies and act accordingly. But kids who have been raised in the post Romero era, and who have never seen White Zombie or any of the other movies that treat zombies in a more traditional way are going to look at The Zombie Farm and say ""what the hell is this crap?"". (The Zombie Farm, by the way, is a fantastic little thriller, and while it's not Islas' best work  when I started this paragraph I had intended to harp on the brilliance of my favorite movie of his, Lockout  but you gotta see it anyway.)NOTE: while the spoiler stop sign is below, this is one case where I will be actively encouraging you to read the spoilers in question, as I believe NOT knowing them will negatively affect your viewing of them film (there is more than enough spoiler laden evidence of this on the IMDB boards to justify this decision).[for those of you not reading this at var.everta, imagine there's a big ""SPOILER ALERT! stop sign here.]What does all of this have to do with Ben Wheatley?, you may be asking yourself. It has to do with Wheatley because Kill List, in everything I heard and read about the movie before I actually saw it, including all of the reviews I allowed myself to read, posited Kill List as Yet Another British Crime Thriller, but a cut above the usual malarkey. So I'm sitting down with this movie thinking I'm going to get another Ray Winstone movie (and wondering why Ray Winstone is, in fact, not in this film), and instead I get The Wicker Man. Except that it took me about thirty minutes of my sitting there saying ""what the [censored for Amazon consumption] did I just watch?"" to realize that I had, in fact, seen a movie that had far more in common with The Wicker Man and the not quite Hammer films of its early seventies ilk than anything Guy Ritchie ever did. (And, as Captain Peacock was wont to say, ""Thank Heaven for that."") But still, I did sit there for thirty minutes asking myself the question. And here's where the marketing bit comes in. I admit, I came quite late to The Wicker Man. I first saw it when I was in high school, though I can't give you a specific year; it was sometime in the mid eighties. I loathed it, but I knew exactly what I was getting into thanks to the VHS box copy and everything I'd read about the film. I knew there was a supernatural element to it from the outset, and I was prepared for that. (I didn't form my current love of the film until the 104 minute cut was released in the late nineties, which made much more sense out of the incomprehensible soup that was the initial American theatrical cut. And as I write this, it was just announced earlier this week that something I have been hoping would happen for over a decade has finally come to pjazz: the twenty two minutes of footage from the original 126 minute cut, which me pal Ian Davey has been telling me forever was probably part of the M1, has been found, and there's a newly remastered director's cut coming on DVD eventually. Oh, happy day.) And for all I know this entire paragraph is a spoiler, and you're not supposed to know about the supernatural element to this movie until it's sprung on you. If so, well, I'll put the spoiler stop sign up at the top of this paragraph when I publish it, but hey guys? That was a really, really bad idea, not letting the public know that this wasn't your basic Britcrime movie.It starts out that way. Jay (Atonement's Neil Maskell), an ex army hit man, hasn't worked in eight months, and the money's run out. Something horrible happened on his last job, but other than us finding out something horrible happened on his last job, we never get any details. His wife Shel (The Descent's MyAnna Buring) is sick of him moping about the house and, in the kind of manipulative move that drives me bats, invites Jay's old partner Gal (Burke and Hare's Michael Smiley) and his new girlfriend Fiona (TV actress Emma Fryer in her first credited feature appearance) over for dinner so Gal can pitch a new job he's just picked up to Jay. Despite his misgivings, Jay is intrigued, so they go to meet the client (Chariots of Fire's Struan Rodger). Seems simple enough: three murders, no questions asked, for an unthinkable sum of money. The first one makes very little sense, but it's quick and easy. The second starts putting the pieces together, and Jay, once he figures out the connection between the three victims, starts off on his own tangent......absolutely none of which has to do with the horror element, really, though all of it does, in murky ways that I can't address without going deep into spoiler territory here. It's a decent movie, and I am certain I would have liked it better had I known what I was getting. The acting is, in general, quite good, though in a number of cases the actors are making the best they can out of mediocre material (did anyone buy the relationship between Jay and Shel? Really?), and the movie is excellently paced once you figure out what Wheatley's doing, or what you think he's doing. Granted, it's not The Wicker Man (or A Serbian Film, to which it has also been compared many times), but it does what it does and does so relatively well much of the time. But you're probably better off knowing what you're getting into. ** ",The Resin Man.,1378080000,"09 2, 2013"

If you want to view this film, he is the only reason to watch this film.After playing the character for four years, Campbell is comfortable in Axe's skin. The film is fairly done for a TV film, but the script by Notice scribe Matt Nix seems a jumbled mess with too many laconic ideals.Jeffrey (Micheal Weston)  Donovan directs this film without many of the Notice trademarks and style shots, which makes you watch this show more and more. It almost seem like this film was  rushed in its scope to wet your whisle for season five of Notice. Again the direction of this film  is due to the disorganized  script whixh plots in directions that peter outCampbell is likeable as Axe, but he has been likeable  in all of Burn Notice episodes. He can hold your interest, but this film is the wrong vehicle for him. He as I said before is the only reason to watch this tripe.Bennet PomerantzAUDIOWORLD",Burn Notice Pre-sequel,1303257600,"04 20, 2011"

One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said ""You don't get it...

"This film reminds me of Bitter Moon, where an older man recounts to a stranger the sexual awakening and deadening of his younger wife.  In this case, a younger woman recounts to an older man the sexual awakening and deadening of herself.Joe:  I've been a bad, bad girl.Seligman:  No, what you did is like fishing, maths and music.Are the overreaching analogies there to bolster the sex parade or is the sex parade there to liven up the overreaching analogies?  It was amusing to watch him barge into her recollections.  The struggle between purely recalling events and attempting to rationalise them is actually.... worth capturing.  Perhaps this is how it occurs within a human mind regarding its past.While the analogies are interesting, even when they are forced like Fibonacci, the constructs of the sexual experiences seem a bit too porn y.  What schoolgirl wears a schoolgirl outfit to her deflowering?  Which two girls do a twist on running a train for a bag of sweets, instead of just sharing the bag   which, by the way, they bought after breaking into the brother's piggy bank?  The juxtaposition of the childishness of the reward and the kinkiness of the quest is filthy.It is said the unsimulated sex scenes shot with adult film actors were digitally grafted onto the film.  First of all, should we believe them?  Secondly, it seems against the thrust of the film to attempt to maintain respectability, by lying, digitally or in press.  But it would have been interesting to discuss the hand of pornography in Joe's realisation of what it means to be a nymphomaniac.",Inevitable Marriage of Porn and Cinema,1397692800,"04 17, 2014"
"Serial horror with standard horror conventions is a new product for American television and in the last year we have gotten American Horror Story and now the intriguing show The River. The River has an interesting premise that has the potential to last for more than one season even if the first central mystery is solved.Dr. Emmett Cole is the host of a documentary reality show that seems vaguely anthropological in focus. Dr. Cole, his wife, his young son and his staff and crew spent the 1980's and 1990's touring the world in their boat, The Magus and exploring the cultures of the world. The past is shown in flashbacks that add to the story and break the tension in a good way. Every moment of Lincoln's childhood was spent chasing the magic and mystery of the world and before the artfully hidden cameras. Lincoln of course rebelled and his mother and father had the usual marital problems when one partner has obsessions the other partner only partially shares. Thus, Dr. Emmett Cole has taken one last trip into the Amazon alone to seek the magic and sorcery of the indigenous peoples of South America and ultimately spiritual enlightenment. Before this is done his family and friends may wish he had been attracted to a Buddhist monastary. And apparantly he finds that magic and it is all too real as he has disappeared leaving tapes with tantalizing glimpses of the magic he has discovered.Dr. Cole's wife is determined to find him and heal the rift between them, even though both of them have had affairs over the course of their marriage. She pushes her reluctant son Lincoln into accompanying her on the expedition because the network is funding it, but only if every moment of fear, anxiety and family discord can be caught on camera. And of course the long time crew is just as much a part of the story as the family, especially in light of the fact that Dr. Cole's first companion on the quest is dead and his is the first ghost the party encounters. Filled with standard horror tropes and the magical realism of South America (in one episode a spirit enters one of the characters via a dragonfly) and the drama between the nicely drawn characters. Another episode features an indigenous Stone Age tribe defending their territory. As a tribe recently appeared out of the jungle and started putting arrows in people in real life, this is more than believable.Three episodes in I recommend this to anyone who likes horror, adventure and mystery. I know I will be watching more episodes as they air. Well written, filmed in an interesting style and incorporating elements not usually seen on American television this is worth investigating.","Interesting Blend of Horror, Magical Realism + Adventure",1329523200,"02 18, 2012"

Even the editing suffered with clearly blocked shots showing technique rather than the seamless quality this series usually exhibits.  I can't emphasize enough how poorly this episode was written:  implied occurrences were spelled out in aghast expressions, over the top exclamations, declarations of intent, &#34;We won't let her get away with this!&#34;, etc.  It felt like an old episode of Adam12.

"The first season of American Horror story was very unique and attention grabbing,When we heard the 2nd season was to take place in an Insane Asylum, we thought ... &#34;Oh yeah&#34; ... should be really good ... perfect setting.Well one complaint people had with the first season was an over reliance on sex scenes to grab attention.That same thing appears in ASYLUM, but pushed even further (and to a bit of an excessive and silly extreme).But beyond that ........... something about this season simply failed to live up to potential.The setting of the insane asylum was not really used to best advantage and there was not really a good central story or theme this time around.As others have said, it felt more like random ideas thrown at a wall just to see what would stick and what would shock.I must say the 3rd season COVEN has already lost our attention completely.We quit watching.We really were excited by this series after seeing the first season, but for us at least ........ it failed to deliver and just became a mish mash of random images and scenes meant to try and visually shock the viewer without really engaging them in a compelling story or plot.Honestly    I think I see why Jessica Lange has voiced her intentions to leave the series and do no more of these.",After a unique a compelling first season .. this Insane asylum based season SHOULD have been great ... but it falters,1386460800,"12 8, 2013"

"Okay. It's a new year so I can have a new WSF (Worst So Far), although I'm sure there will be even worse as the year goes on. As a rule, I find most clich&eacute;d situations to be diverting, but not the groaners in this thing. I'm sure the gales of laughter that met the finale were NOT what the director had in mind! (To be fair, sometimes a screening audience IS a tough sell.)Director Paul W.S. Anderson (&#34;The Three Musketeers&#34;) specializes in Computer Generated Imaging, so this actioner contains no surprises, but this bloodbath piled cruelty upon cruelty: lashings, bashings, smashings and slashings, so I kept my eyes covered and my yawns smothered much of the time. How many ways can they draw blood or cause mental anguish? (One couple actually brought a toddler. Okay, no profanity, so no harm.....)These folks have had better roles, but they give it their best:* Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje (&#34;Thor: The Dark World&#34;) has our sympathy as the gladiator promised his freedom if he wins his last fight. Yeah... right...* Kit Harington (&#34;Game of Thrones&#34;) is our hero, a Celt with uncommon fighting skills, enslaved by Roman soldiers since childhood. Of course it's love at first sight when our heroine makes her entrance.* Emily Browning (&#34;Sucker Punch&#34;) is that puffy lipped heroine. She is betrothed (unwillingly) to a Roman senator by her less than courageous father.* Jared Harris (&#34;Mad Men&#34;) is that father, who apparently backed the wrong politician and now has to make amends to the current powers that be.* Carrie Anne Moss (&#34;Vegas&#34;) is his wife. At least she can see the political scene clearly, although there is very little she can do about it.* Kiefer Sutherland (Lots of TV) is the dastardly senator from Rome who lusts after our heroine and wants to invest in real estate in our fair city. (Pompeii was considered a resort town by the Romans.)No fight is worth watching unless there are insurmountable odds (which of course our hero surmounts) and lots of blood. And we only HEAR him break that horse's neck....I don't remember archaeologists mentioning a tsunami, do you? I thought it was pyroclastic (searing) blasts and ash fall from Mount Vesuvius that killed the good folks in Pompeii.

"Paul Schrader, oh how you've fallen.  The writer and director of ""American Gigolo"" and the screenwriter of such cljazzics as ""Raging Bull"" and ""Taxi Driver"" has put out this piece of garbage written by Bret Easton Ellis.  Funded in part by Kickstarter, the filmmakers were able to keep Lindsay Lohan out of rehab long enough to play what appears to be a version of herself.  She's not very good and the rest of the cast is even worse.Lindsay plays a one time actress named Tara who is now in a relationship with Christian (porn star James Deen).  Christian is a small time movie producer, who supplements his income with a trust fund from his father.  One of the conditions of the fund is that he regularly meet with a psychiatrist (director Gus Van Sant slumming).  Christian likes to have other men come over as well as couples.  He enjoys seeing Tara in action with others, it would seem, as much as his one on one time.  Tara goes along, sometimes reluctantly, other times enthusiastically.  If this all sounds pretty sexy, it really isn't.Throughout the movie, Schrader pulls the plug just as it all gets interesting.  This goes for other elements of the plot, as it were, as well.  When Christian suspects Tara is seeing someone else, he has her followed, hacks her phone and has others get information for him.  The other guy (Nolan Gerard Funk) is also having an affair with Christian's jazzistant (Amanda Brooks).  Then there is Christian's former and sometimes current lover on the side played by Tenille Houston.  It seems that they all know each other but don't know it.  If this sounds convoluted, it is.Nothing makes much sense and if there is anything worse than the acting, it is the script.  All the main characters call each other ""babe.""  Example:  ""Hey babe, how you doin'?""  ""Fine babe, thanks for asking.""  Much of the film reminded me of ""The Californians"" skit on Saturday Night Live that is so funny.  So, what does the film having going for it that I would rate it so high?  Well, the sets are pretty cool.  Christian's pad, set on a secluded mountain side near L. A. (Malibu?), is pretty spectacular.  The soundtrack (mostly Brendan Canning with Me & John) is also noteworthy.  As are Ms. Lohan's ""ta tas.""  Being an equal opportunity filmmaker, Schrader allows Deen and another dude to show why they are so big in the adult film industry.  The film is sometimes titillating but, alas no climax.As far as the Blu ray disc, it does a decent job transferring the bland photography.  Clarity is good.  You can see all the bumps and bruises on Lohan's legs.  The film is cheaply made and it shows, but that is not the fault of the transfer.  In addition to an uncompressed 2.0 stereo track, there is DTS HD Master Audio 5.1.  Both are good if unspectacular.  The soundtrack sounds very good and dialog is properly focused.  The film includes Spanish and English SDH subtitles.  Extras include a trailer and a couple short featurettes.  Here's a case where a supplement consisting of auditions might have been better than the movie.",(BLU RAY REVIEW) 1 1/2 stars for a film that teases but has no climax,1390953600,"01 29, 2014"

"I saw not the Overlook Hotel, but the haunted New York apartment building based on the real life Dakota in Rosemary's Baby, complete with the research into the building's evil and storied past. It is a genre trope that I like, so for that alone and the potential therein I was hooked.A young couple, living on the fringes of New York glamour in terms of the company that their professions bring them (lawyer and architect) but in the sticks in Queens in terms of their income, is first tempted with the offer of a beautiful apartment on the Upper East Side of New York for a nominal amount of managing work. Indeed, in the interview they are told that they need to keep their day jobs, so clearly there is another person or people in the building doing daily maintenance work. They grab the opportunity as anyone in their right mind would as it takes rich person money to live a middle cljazz life in Manhattant. Nobody tells you that cheap, beautiful apartments in Manhattant require not only money but your immortal soul.It turns out that the building has more than just beautiful views and fixtures. It is stated more than implied that the owner is at the very least the devil's henchman. In addition to introducing the core characters, we are introduced to what may be the ""tenant of the week"" who falls afoul of the gifts given by the buildings owner. This week a tenant has his wife brought back to life but cannot keep murdering to keep her alive and ends by losing his own life as well.All in all, I thought that this was a moderately promising pilot. I will be watching again and hope that the core characters are made more interesting in episodes to come and that the nefarious history of the building and its owners is uncovered at a steady pace. The innocent young couple trope and the older, urbane, devilish temptors has been done before not only in Rosemary's Baby but in the Devil's Advocate; this doesn't have to be a weakness but these weren't the strongest out of the box characterizations that I have ever seen and I hope they deepen and become more human and less carboard tropes as the season progresses. Recommended to fans of the new serials and mysteries. So far is unsettling rather than the real terror of horror, which works for me but may not for others.

"This very intelligent and entertaining series is finally coming to an end.  I, for one, am caught up in the game: Who's the last Cylon?  I don't think that the series creators are going to go for the clich&eacute; ""it's the Admiral or the President"", but for the life of me, I don't know who that leaves.The entire series has been an adventure that parallels our current political atmosphere but translates it into a sci fi journey.  This is what this genre does best   it holds up the fun house mirror for us to view ourselves in a distorted perspective.The mood of BSG tends to be quite ""Film Noir"".  When I looked up a definition in Wikipedia I found the following:""Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic. The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations (which, in general, they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating), striving against random, uncaring fate, and frequently doomed. The movies are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt. Cljazzic film noir has been jazzociated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era.""I thought this was a pretty good account of all seasons of BSG.  Another film noir factor to take into account is the general moral ambiguity.  It seems that the Cylons are the ones who are now taking the moral high ground and seem to be more open to weighing the pros and cons of each ethical decision.  They are becoming the principled ones and the humans have adapted an ethos of ""if it's different, it's bad!"" and not to be trusted.  Lifelong friendships are dismissed in an instant if this person (entity) turns out to be a ""toaster"".This may be a foolish question but I wonder if the Earth they found is real?

"This is supposed to be a legal drama about a cljazz action lawsuit. But rather than lawyers, all the characters are basically gangsters on both sides of the case. Glenn Close gives an extraordinary performance and Rose Byrne does better than expected, but the story and script really let them down.At the heart of the story is basically a lifted from Enron case where the employees of a bankrupt company are going after its former CEO. But its a superficial resemblence because whoever wrote the script understood little about such matters.Ted Danson drags the whole piece down. Since Glenn Close is playing an evil character, Danson's character has to be played as arch evil. Mustache twirling evil. And Danson delivers an astonishly stupid broadly drawn evil character. And he is probably close to what Danson imagines every non Hollywood CEO to being. Danson goes out of his way to make sure that there is no possible way to have any sympathy for rich Mr. businessman. And thats really the only way for the story to work given that Glenn Close is playing a gangster.For a series about the law, there is very little ""law"" in it and what law it has is done unimaginatively. They never get beyond the depositions. They never follow anything like the timeline of a real case. And why not. To the main characters, law is a distraction. If lawyers spent time on legal matters, when would they have time all the gangster stuff: Hiding and killing witnesses, blackmailing the opposing lawyer, spying, stealing, witness intimidation, bribing prosecutors, containing the ambitions of the underbosses and so on. The character Glenn Close somewhat resembles is the lawyer Sean Penn played in the film ""Carlito's way"".One of the core problems with the Glenn Close character is that her word means nothing. Every deal she makes, she goes back on. A stand alone character can work like that. But not someone running a law firm. Any organization runs on a certain level of trust. A lawyer operating within the profession depends on a certain level of trust. If she was going to act like that, she needed in the context of the show to keep herself innocent and to preserve her image at all costs.The series would have been more interesting if it had been more realistic and if both sides in the case had been shades of grey. And to cover all the stages of a case: (1) Selling the client to take you on as a lawyer (2) figuring out a strategy(3) depositions and discovery, (4) negotiating over a settlement (5) Witness prep (5) jury selection (6) the trial.The combination of amoral gangster lawyer and ruthless crusader for justice also really doesn't work. Every time Glenn Close starts to talks about ""victims"", it comes across as totally false.By the end of the season, they have started walking down the sad road toward making excuses for Glenn Close's behavior. Dead baby drama in a cemetary is an incredibly cheap way to drum up sympathy.This is another of those things where the potential and most of the actors end up being greater than the script that they were given.",uneven gangster drama,1326672000,"01 16, 2012"

"Jack Begosian (Andy Garcia) is a former CIA operative who has retired to Toronto and hosts an all night talk radio show.  Hey, why not?  For nearly all the movie he anguishes about something in his CIA past, but never tells us any specifics.  At the same time, way down in Ecuador, Francisco Francis (Forest Whitaker) and his wife Mia (rifle toting Eva Longoria) are being chased by the army for undermining a Canadian water purification project headed by evil capitalist Bruce Swinton (Kim Coates).It seems that the huge water corporation brewed things up and allowed typhus to enter the water system, killing many locals.  If that wasn't bad enough, a corrupt general is executing any and all who try to escape.  Tipped off by a suicidal escapee, Swinton's sister, and major stockholder, Morgan (Deborah Kara Unger) convinces Jack with some big bucks to exfiltrate the Francis family, shedding light on the dirty business.  Jack reluctantly accepts the jazzignment realizing it will give him an opportunity to correct what happened when he was last in South America.  Oh, and the big bucks.While much of the photography is excellent, writer and director Damian Lee bungle the production with a ridiculous script.  Unger doesn't help much with her dour characterization that never changes from a zoned out aristocrat.  Garcia is much better, especially given the words he has to work with.  Kevin Durand is a hired jazzjazzin who changes direction, one that is easily foreseen.

"Edit:  After viewing Season Two, I feel that the show really found its groove  developing the characters further and making the outrageousness absolutely integral to the plot with a big payoff in each episode.  So while Season One was a bit hit or miss, for me, it really evolves into a 5 star winner!In an effort to capitalize on the audience from ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia,"" the FX network has tried a number of promising shows. ""Sunny,"" to me, has always been a completely inspired bit of lunacy that defies everything about the age of political correctness in which we find ourselves. It is so wrong  but that's what makes it so right. Unapologetically demented and offensive, the show has moments of brilliance. ""The League"" does work as a companion piece, albeit with a bit more unevenness and with mixed results. In some ways, the show tries too hard to push boundaries, to be as edgy as ""Sunny."" Instead of relying on its genuinely funny cast and an effective premise, the show strains for shock value. Still, I enjoyed Season One of ""The League,"" but I don't feel as if it has reached its true potential.Part scripted, part improvisation, ""The League"" revolves around a group of friends and the mania that accompanies their yearly fantasy football league. The easy camaraderie and the edge of competitiveness are present in equal measure  but let's face it, the show is about guys behaving badly. In brutal and funny sequences, the guys goad and insult one another in the ultimate game of one ups manship. The cast of semi familiar faces features a great performances by comedian Paul Scheer as one of the more aggressively in your face competitors and newcomer Jonathan Lajoie as the most clueless and unaffected of the group. Indie favorite Mark Dupljazz (""The Puffy Chair"") is the nominal lead and perhaps the most sane of the bunch. Stephen Rannazzisi, whose wife wears the fantasy football pants, and Nick Kroll, the smarmiest and most over confident contestant, round out the primary cast.If you're looking for a show that is football centric, ""The League"" is not particularly a show about sport. It's about brotherhood and friendship and true caveman spirit! The jokes can be hit or miss, as can whole episodes, but the entire cast tries gamely. There is lots of energy, and generally when something doesn't work  something else quickly follows. It's fast paced mayhem with a heart. Season Two is starting up on FX any day now and I wish the show well. An enjoyable initial outing, I'd rate the first season of ""The League"" at 3 1 2 stars with some room to grow.

"Some of the worst television ever produced; it isn't quite bad enough to be revolting, but it's close. The Blacklist tells the story of brave Federal agents stopping terrorists (usually violent domestic activists bent on killing people, unlike the real life domestic activists who are mostly non violent). The agents also spend time at a black ops site where there are no prisoners, no cages, and no torture, again unlike real black ops sites. Like children playing war, the agents race here and there defeating bad guys. It has lots of action and little reflection. So, it shouldn't be surprising that it is mainly based on empty stereotypes. The one bright spot is James Spader's character. He is the father of the female lead (though we haven't been told this yet) and he may, or may not, be an international terrorist. The mystery around this character, and Spader's acting, are compelling, but not enough to overcome the lack of development of the other characters, the silly writing, and the children's tale that is The Blacklist.",Where are the rotten tomatoes?,1386115200,"12 4, 2013"

"Someone said in the long time ago that people see what they expect to see. If &#8220;Room 237&#8221; proves something, it is exactly this famous saying. The film is a documentary about five avid fans of Stanley Kubrick&#8217;s cljazzic &#8220;The Shining,&#8221; who present through voiceover their theories about the hidden meanings by analyzing the details.The idea is great. Execution is not. Each commentator&#8217;s analysis is introduced in a random way, and there is no sense of structure and narrative development in the whole film. The documentary goes on and on jumping from one theory to another without exploring any of these contents.I believe Stanley Kubrick paid attention to every single detail, down to the number of the room, even though I do think some part of these details is accidental. Still, I admire the pjazzion and enthusiasm of these five fans, and some of their analysis are really interesting (about a wrecked red Volkswagen beetle, for instance), but most of them are just far fetched and uninteresting. Fakes moon landing? Oh, please.There is one good thing about the documentary, and that is it has a lot of footage from the original film. After all the merit of watching &#8220;Room 237&#8221; is that it reminds us of how great &#8220;The Shining&#8221; is.","Secrets and Subtexts of ""The Shining"" (And They Are Not Very Interesting)",1394150400,"03 7, 2014"
"This series has a lot going for it, and the best part of it is that it keeps the viewer guessing as to the guilt or innocence of the accused until the very end. Where it fails is that it so successfully engages one into doubting the guilt of the perpetrator that when the denouement comes it seems too quick and out of character. The stories are terrific in painting pictures of a fractured society, with a very ugly underbelly  where people fall through the cracks and terrible things can and do happen. Often the individual sets[ I watched up to number five]deal with horrific events that happened to the perpetrator during childhood, or show children who are adversely affected by the crimes in the present.The first episode is the most chilling and realistic, more for its depiction of negligent and abusive parenting, poverty and the foster care system than for the actual crime. And whoever cast the series dipped into an amazing pool of talent, particularly when it came to the villains and the attorneys. The leading actors are less charismatic and the focus on their private lives took away from the police procedural [always in the first half], which is invariably taut and well written. Despite any shortcomings, I did enjoy the series, and it made me think  sometimes a good thing.","interesting, yet flawed",1377561600,"08 27, 2013"

"What would you do on the eve of the planet's destruction? That is the question posited by Abel Ferrara's ""4:44 Last Day On Earth."" The answer, it would seem, is to live it much like any other. I'm a fan of Ferrara as a filmmaker, I find him refreshingly unpredictable. I'm not sure, however, that ""4:44 Last Day On Earth"" conveyed and or made the most of its intriguing premise. While I appreciate that not every apocalyptic endeavor has to be big, bold, and melodramatic  at times this felt so underplayed as to be virtually non existent. While the concept and images advertising the movie may make it seem like a thriller (the word suspenseful is used in the description), this is a slow burn contemplation in which not much happens. Luckily, Ferrera had the wherewithal to cast Willem Dafoe as his central protagonist. Dafoe, as usual, makes for interesting viewing. This seems like an incredibly personal work for Ferrera and the intimacy that Dafoe brings to his performance is never less than fascinating.The inconvenient truth of the situation is that Al Gore and his contemporaries were correct about their dire environmental predictions. Catastrophe, however, is way ahead of schedule and the end of the world has been pinpointed with precision. How? Don't ask. Despite the fact that it is supposedly the last day on earth (not everyone believes it, even though news broadcasts have ended due to the imminent game changer), nothing seems too drastically different in Dafoe's neighborhood. Traffic and pedestrians seem normal, stores and bars are open, you can order Chinese food. There is never a real sense of doom. Most of the movie is spent in one apartment with Dafoe and his girlfriend (Shanyn Leigh) dancing, using Skype, painting, making love, or just hanging out independently. Ferrera's point, perhaps, is that life goes on even if there isn't much of it left. While an interesting notion from an intellectual perspective, it doesn't necessarily make riveting entertainment.I do give ""4:44 Last Day On Earth"" a marginal recommendation (mostly for the performances) for the arthouse crowd, I'm not sure the film will have a universal appeal. At a mere 82 minutes, I kept wishing 4:44 in the morning would arrive sooner. The film has a pleasing grittiness and rawness, and I appreciated the use of actual news footage (constantly playing in the background) to make the apocalypse seem tangible. Once again, don't think this is a thriller! It is a stagnant character piece with minimal dialogue. I'm not sure what I'd do on my last night on earth, I can only hope it would be more interesting than what is presented here. Ferrera's vision is filled with shopping, Chinese take out, and karaoke. An interesting approach, to be sure, but not as compelling as I hoped. Watched it with a friend, he bailed at the 30 minute mark.

The other 90% is standard soap operatics, illustrating over and over and over and over again that spooky inexplicable disasters bring out the absolute worst in human nature. Looting, rioting, raping murdering, having babies at inconvenient times, stealing food and water and medicine, from each other, etc., etc., etc., etc.,And the fantasy? Pretty thin stuff.  Trust me. The premise is kind of klunky to begin with and it doesn't get any better.Unless you like cheesy soap operas and endless illustrations of how desperate times bring out the the absolute worst in people from small New England towns   with the occasional whiff of hokey science fiction   then watch something else.","interesting premise, nicish f/x but loaded with cheap clich&eacute;s",1379376000,"09 17, 2013"

"""30 Rock"", the NBC sitcom that has the most Emmy Awards (22) for a single year for a comedy series.

The television series is shot via single camera and has that drama series style of quality.  But for the most part, the show is anamorphic widescreen and picture quality is satisfactory for what you would expect from television on DVD.As for audio, audio is presented in English Dolby Digital 5.1.  For home theater owners with a receiver, the audio is front and channel driven with the dialogue being clear and understandable and the opening theme song coming quite lively.  But for the most part, the audio is satisfactory for a comedy.  Personally, I had my receiver set at stereo on all channels as my primary selection and preference in hearing the series.Subtitles are presented in English SDH.SPECIAL FEATURES:""30 ROCK   Season 3' includes quite a number of special features:DISC 1:* Flu Shot Episode Commentary with Tina Fey & Jeff RichmondDISC 2:* Goodbye, My Friend Commentary with Judah Friedlander & John Lutz* The Bubble Commentary with Jon Hamm & Jack McBrayer* Apollo, Apollo Commentary with Jack Burditt & Robert CarlockDISC 3:* The Ones Commentary with Jane Krakowski & Jack McBrayer* Mamma Mia Commentary with Alan Alda* Kidney Now!

The third season showed no signs of slowdown and every episode, you just want to laugh because the characters are hilarious but most of all, the writing is just top notch.  And all 22 episodes in the third season does not disappoint at all.With the second season DVD release from last year, the show was really facing major challenges as the Writers Guild Strike really cut down on the episodes and no one knew if NBC was going to cancel the show but they gave it some time and next thing you know, the show won many awards.  The fact that the show has been nominated for 22 awards in 2009 alone is a testament of how people respect the show's writing and its talent.  As mentioned earlier in my review, ""30 ROCK"" is one of those rare and unique shows on television and everything manages to work perfectly.I've watched Season 3 on television and I couldn't wait to watch the episodes again, that's how much I really enjoy this series.  It's witty, fun and comedy that is highly entertaining!  In fact, as for favorite episodes, there is just so many.  From finding out who Liz Lemon was talking to on the plane ride in the episode ""Believe in the Stars"", to see the reuniting of the ""Night Court"" characters and also see Jennifer Aniston's ""Claire"" getting into mischief in ""The One with the Cast of Night Court"", Kenneth going on a date with a blind staffer with Tracy's help in ""St. Valentine's Day"", Jack seeing a duplicate of himself on the Spanish soap opera in ""Generalissimo"" or Liz and Jack visiting Liz's high school reunion in the episode titled ""Reunion"".  There are just too many fantastic episodes from this third season, that I can't see any fan being disappointed.As for the DVD release of ""30 ROCK   Season 3', this DVD is literally a solid release.  Not only do you get all 22 episodes, 7 audio commentary (and the good news is that they give a variety of talent, even guest stars a chance to take part in the audio commentary) but you also get a good number of other special features that really round out this wonderful DVD release.  Overall, the show is wonderful and the only thing I can hope for is that Universal considers releasing ""30 Rock"" on Blu ray via High Definition.But there is nothing negative I can say about this release.  It's a solid release and fans of the series will definitely get their money's worth!  ""30 ROCK   Season 3' is highly recommended.","Absolutely fantastic!  Fans of `30 Rock', the third season is another witty, hilarious and highly entertaining season.",1254355200,"10 1, 2009"
"So many of my favorite characters die off or disappear on this series.  Only two of the original cast remain by the end of the series.

"Steven Moffat contributed some outstanding individual episodes to the rebooted Dr Who series back when Russell T Davis was lead writer and showrunner. Moffat also wrote a truly excellent transition episode, introducing the Matt Smith Doctor, that was far more convincing that any of RTD's transitions.But...As showrunner, Moffat has been something of a disappointment. It's not so much the over ambitious story arcs as the inability to manage emotions. Moffat's Doctor is too much the fast moving slapstick clown without the pathos necessary to provide emotional depth. Worse yet is Moffat's addiction to The Great Reset Button In The Sky. In Moffat's universe loss is something to be avoided, so people keep dying (poor Rory in particular) over and over again and being brought back over and over again until frankly we don't care. Moffat doesn't seem able, as a writer, to grasp that without the possibility of loss there's no possibility of really engaging the audience's emotions. When we know it's all going to be yet another conjuring trick we get bored. Very seriously bored.So here, in the swan song episode for Matt Smith's Doctor, we get the standard Moffat tropes. Worse, we get a cursory ""tie up the loose ends"" overlay that doesn't work on any level at all. There's neither intellectual nor emotional consistency   just a superficial gloss that fails utterly to convince. It's as if Moffat is emotionally autistic, so clumsy is the writing at times. There's just one tiny moment right before the very end that is genuinely touching and the effect, at this late stage, is simply to make the viewer think ""how did that slip through the Moffat filter??""Now that we have a new Doctor in the shape of Peter Capaldi, perhaps we can hope earnestly for a new showrunner. It's not clear how long the rebooted Doctor Who can survive under Moffat's continued leadership. People's expectations are much higher after RTD's brilliant re awakening of the series than they were back in the long ago days when just enough folk were content to sit through the moribund scripts and awful effects of the Jon Pertwee period.

"I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)  in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's a new update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said ""In a well written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well written melodrama come out of the story."" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot driven, rather than character driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say ""They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?"" I expect good drama  character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful bookThe Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat: And Other Clinical Tales, he describes the behavior and bizarre ""reality"" of patients who've suffered right hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV SeriesThe Crow: Stairway To Heaven   The Complete SeriesorFairytale: A True Story. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist  I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year old boys with high level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected  as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded & or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's  especially their daughters'  imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that.  All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think, link below)  and the hit showBorgen   Season 1too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin,He's Just Not That Into You, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense.  Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: ""Mix up the metaphors!  Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing.  Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!"" Or: ""Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity.  HEY! How about  SAVIOR  it's LOADED with jazzociations, throw THAT in!""  Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amjazzed, how much convoluted but simplistic drivel can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy  smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for.  If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.  WELL DONE!Sadly, it didn't.  Emma tells the love of her life that she'd hoped he was dead, for no other reason than to set up the continued relationship with Hook. They couldn't have come up with a better line than that?  Awful. In the latest episode, we learn of Peter Pan's origin  another dazzling twist, dazzle purely for dazzle's sake.  Pan's Scottish brogue morphs into an English accent when he becomes a boy, unbelievably.  I am so discouraged with the gaffes, the lack of care, substance and depth, so disappointed.","Still watching, but...",1381017600,"10 6, 2013"

"***Slight plot spoiler review as I explain what I think is going on, but not the ending***Attempting to come to terms with the death of his daughter, a down on his luck horror author finds himself in the small town of Swan Valley, one that has its own haunted tale. The film uses human parallels to create a story.Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) is convinced by Sheriff Bobby LaGrange (Bruce Dern) to stay in town and collaborate on a book he is working on. The town has a bell tower with 7 clocks all with a different time to illustrate the timelessness of tales. As Baltimore dreams he sees the crime of children being murdered as shown to him by Edgar Allen Poe (Ben Chaplin) his writer alter ego. There is the mysterious V, or Virginia (Elle Fanning) the vampire who represents his own daughter Vicky. We see this symbolism as he attempts to write the tale confusing Vicky with Virginia and as he talks to Poe, who is sometimes not there.It is an interesting tale that is filled with mystery and light on the vampire and horror part. I think the film would had been better with the ""1408"" John Cusack in the starring role instead of Kilmer.

"The story is simple. Well, apparently. A young journalist Andrew (Scoot McNairy) is sent to Central America to escort the wounded daughter of his employer, Samantha (Whitney Able) back to the United States. Their initial plans to get out of the country through a safer route are thwarted, however, and Andrew and Samantha have to go through the dangerous zone of northern Mexico, where the feared ""monsters"" or extraterrestrial creatures are barely contained.Obviously Gareth Edwards' ""monster"" movie is not exactly about the ""monsters,"" or Godzilla like ""kaiju"" creatures stomping cars and wrecking havoc in a big city. Creatures do appear, though briefly, and their effects and designs are pretty effective, but the film is mostly about the land and the people (including the protagonists) separated from United States. Sometimes ""Monsters"" looks like Cary Fukunaga's ""Sin Nombre,"" a road movie about immigration, but with less interesting characters and a weaker storyline.""Monsters"" uses the existing landscapes cleverly, creating effectively the uneasy atmosphere of the war torn lands, but the beautifully shot cinematography can hardly cover the fact that the main characters are terribly underwritten. Andrew and Samantha   the on screen travelers with zero chemistry   everything about them including their back stories and dialogues is just boring.I don't pretend to know what the titular ""monsters"" refers to, and frankly, I don't care.

"The core device of horror in Would You Rather isn't terrible: desperate people are competing, and getting paid to do horrible things to one another.  Many horror movies these days have populist and or &#34;game show&#34; angle.  Recently 13 Sins and Cheap Thrills played with this concept in a pretty satisfying way.Would You Rather unfortunately distinguishes itself from those movies by not making much sense.  The title suggests something like Fear Factor, where participants torture themselves.  But what they actually do is choose which other participant they will do something awful too.  That said, there is no consequence for choosing wrong, or a real way to lose   except not participating.Players die incidentally because they are tasked with stabbing, hurting, and mutilating each other   not because of some wicked twist in the game or whatever.

He should be with someone smart like Alex,or Priya, not a dumb bimbo blonde with way too much attitude who believes in psychics and gets mad when he points out to her that all psychics are frauds. Season six was better than season five but the show has lost it's direction. I like the additions of Bernadette and Amy, I just wish they were allowed to be the smart women they are supposed to be.

"I've found that message movies for the most part offer incredibly boring films that while trying to speak from the heart inevitably fail to entertain or hold your attention for long. Rarely does one succeed. For the most part these movies fail miserably and disappear from memory quickly. How many can say that they're fans of LIONS FOR LAMBS? You don't recall it? Not a surprise.For the most part message movies don't do much harm, though on rare occasions overzealous film makers tend to offer simplistic discussions promoting a topic they believe rather than an unbiased account. The majority of these movies seem to head straight to DVD rather than receive theatrical runs. That's not always a bad thing. Once in a while a decent movie comes out and gets into homes this way. Such is the case with A DARK TRUTH.Andy Garcia stars as Jack Begosian, an ex CIA agent who now hosts his own political talk radio program. Trying to rebuild his life and steer clear of his past, Begosian must face his history when he is asked by one of the owners of a water purification company to investigate the particulars of a small village in South America. It seems that almost everyone there died of something wrong in the water. Begosian at first refuses but when he is told that the leader of a small group trying to get the truth out is Francisco Francis (Forest Whittaker) he agrees. It seems that Begosian owes a debt to Francis but we're not aware of what that is until later.On the run from corrupt leaders and military officials Francis and his group move through the jungle simply trying to avoid capture. Amazingly Begosian has no problem finding them though. He approaches them and offers them help at about the same time the military shows to take out as many as they can. On the run Begosian learns what the actual problem is and that Francis has the proof that will show the world what happened.The message here becomes one of corporate greed and manipulation. The evil corporate giant that has contracts around the world in water purification and management has failed in the small town mentioned before. Rather than seek out a solution to the problem they instead have tried to erase it so they can continue to market their product around the world and increase their wealth. Why they wouldn't seek out a solution to the problem so they can continue to profit from a good product doesn't matter. What matters is portraying corporations as all evil, all bad and all willing to kill to keep information from reaching the public.So yes, the film becomes predictable for the most part. It still is well made and acted and offers some mild entertainment. Just don't get sucked into the message. Are there terrible corporations in this world who will exploit the mjazzes for a buck? I have little doubt. But cookie cutting movies will most likely not be the thing that leads to change.

The solution to the dilemma is to make continual references to how powerful they are, yet provide some reason why they are incompetent for the bulk of each episode. This gets sort of tiresome in that it's hard to cheer for such weak and helpless people, and who don't seem interested in learning magic.

"I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan. Not so much. I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and wasn't considered a vegan product. Did you know Oreo's are vegan? Yep! Wow, and so healthy for you...  That's when I realized the film maker wasn't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don't even get me started on all the soy crap they ""discover"". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read ""Diet For a New America"" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with. It felt like the filmmaker's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly. It wasn't about health at all. The message I got was ""become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer"".And, if you don't know anything else, you're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half way through, so maybe it isn't fair of me to give it a review, but I think it's important that other people know before going in, what's in store for them.

"I enjoyed The Sopranos so decided to give this a whirl in order to see if fiction and ""reality"" overlap much. It turns out that this is not only comparing apples to oranges; it is also like comparing the Mona Lisa (The Sopranos) to an avant garde exhibit that consists of a pile of poop (Mob Wives). I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety, but I just couldn't get thru many eps of this... there is only so much dim witted posturing, backstabbing, lying, and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month (when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities, as in a work of fiction).From a purely anthropological viewpoint, however, this show has some worth. It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to: material wealth, broken families, and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence. Since Mob Wives is not without context, it also offers perspective on a broader (societal) scale. It is, more often than not, a sickening serial to watch, even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture. I estimate that two of the women are of very low intelligence, one is of low intelligence, and one is of low to moderate intelligence. Aside from needing the money, I can't imagine why these 4 would have agreed to do this show (although if I remember correctly, one of them wanted to write a book, so this is obviously good publicity). They either are clueless about how pathetic they appear to the rest of us, or they don't care (laughing all the way to the bank).I skipped ahead to an episode titled ""Dumb or Stupid?"" (the producers probably would have liked this to be the name of the show, rather than just one episode) because I wanted to see how far these women would go against their ""friends"" at a dinner gathering.

"A few years back Quentin Tarrantino and Robert Rodriquez made a film called GRINDHOUSE. The film featured two movies that paid tribute to the type of film known as grindhouse films, exploitation films that played in the cheap theaters of New York's Times Square and across the country in most drive ins. They usually featured copious amounts of blood, breasts, gore, violence and were usually in pretty poor condition physically with scratched prints galore. The two directors also included fake previews of coming attractions in their film. Which led to a contest.The contest was to see if online readers could make their own coming attraction preview in the grindhouse mode. I honestly don't recall what the winner received with the exception of being known online as the winner. In this case the winner was Jason Eisner and his preview was for HOBO WITH A SHOTGUN. From that short preview Eisner found backing to make it into a feature film and switched from an unknown to movie star Rutger Hauer in the lead role. The film remains true to the preview and offers one of the goriest films ever made.Shot in an extra bright seemingly psychedelic palette of colors, the film opens with Hauer riding the rails and stopping to get off in a town renamed Scum Town via spray paint on the original sign. This town looks bad from the start. Trash fills the street, people are covered in dirt and grime and everyone seems to walk around in a daze.While picking up bottles to trade for cash, the Hobo watches as a man runs down the street begging for help, handcuffed and wearing what appears to be a manhole cover around his neck. Caught by a pair of bad guys doing their best Tom Cruise impersonations, their boss father shows up. The Drake is mean with a capital M. This is his brother and he's unhappy with him but rather than give him a break, he drops him in a hole, puts a barb wire noose around his neck and after attaching the other end to his son's car decapitates him. The blood flows freely and excessively, a geyser of red that covers The Drake's scantily clad companion.The Hobo runs into the pair of sons again and enters their club unseen. He watches as a young woman named Abby stands up to the leader of the two and saves her from them; placing himself in danger should he be caught later on. Abby later befriends the Hobo and he tells her all he wants is enough money to buy a lawnmower and start his own business.Instead when he goes to buy the mower after making enough money, a trio of robbers enters the pawn shop where he's at and threatens everyone there. He makes a quick decision and walks past the lawnmower to the shotgun on the wall and opens up on the trio. The result is more flowing blood and gore. The Hobo becomes a hero of sorts, walking around town in broad daylight and shooting every violent miscreant that walks the streets.Of course this catches the eye of The Drake and he sends his sons out to take care of the situation. More gore, more blood and plenty of violence follows until the final showdown happens.If you understand the word Troma, then you'll know what to expect here. Outlandish simplistic plot, an overabundance of gore blood and acting that is more often than not sub par. There is no depth to the story here and people with necks sawed with a tree saw survive to fight again, people with broken limbs feel no pain after a face full of cocaine and the world continues to look crummy even as the end credits role.Fans of this sort of film and of Troma (who surprisingly had nothing to do with this film) pictures will adore this movie. Those who like more mainstream films will find their jaws dropping into their laps as they watch scene after scene. And those like me, somewhere in the middle, will appreciate the attempt at making a grindhouse epic while at the same time wondering why? Not only that, we'll wonder why an actor of Hauer's stature would think this was worth being in. Has he truly landed on hard times? I can think of no other reason than the sheer novelty of being in this movie.A word of warning: this movie is DEFINITELY not for kids. The extreme gore scenes while played out in all their bright colored glory are not for the sensitive nor for young eyes.",GRINDHOUSE TRIBUTE,1313366400,"08 15, 2011"

"I watch because of Kevin Bacon. Kevin is not his usual excellence. Why? I suspect because of his inexperience in acting in TV series. I understand though. It take time to prepare and Kevin does not have time enough to get into the acting. And the character Clair has the good fortune to have kissed Kevin and Timothy of Justified. Three stars because I know it will be better Season Two. I hope then a believable plot will be offered.No, I will not pay for a Season Two, if there is one, which I say there will not be a Second season.Kevin Bacon: Kevin needed easy money. He signed a contract for easy money. Kevin walks a thin line here. If I did not know Kevin, I would never watch a movie with him as a primary player   based on his performance in this series. And the story.  Way too predictable, way too easy devices to creat fear, for instance, the buried alive female character.Value of each episode: $.75, yes, I mean to say 75 cents.I just watched Episode 15.  The Joe Carrol character's accent is silly. The missed sniper shot of  the Ryan character hit another officer. Too obviously illogical to the plot. And so unbelievable. The final scenes are a mish mash of several films and TV shows childishly done. Every scene is easily predictable. This series is silly. I jazzure you that I will not waste my money on a second season. Watch Justified for excellent acting by all, the viewer cannot predict what will occur.

"I wanted to Give Season 3 a poke in the head and put it out of its misery. How much of the Crazy Governor were they going to force on us? How many close ups of Rick's crazy eyes? How long was the sublimely oblivious Andrea going to overlook the fact that her boyfriend was stark raving nutso?  Michone, who started out impossibly over the top with her matched pair of pet zombies on leashes, is much more real and interesting now. No longer acting like a rebellious 13 year old, she still wields her katanka with amazing accuracy, but has become more three dimensional and less of a cartoon character. She is spending most of her time with the survivors and only semi hunting for the governor...he's not completely out of the picture although I do hope he's going to be held down to a minimum. I just wish they had not killed off Merle in Season 3. He was one of my favorite characters...what's not to like about a guy who can cut off his own limb and replace it with a swiss army arm?I started watching Season 4 without much hope and boy howdy, was I surprised. There's life the The Dead yet.  Episode 1 was killer. Rick regained his sanity, sort of.  His son is less psychotic. Herschell's missing leg has magically regenerated. No explanations are given, but the comic book version does mention that they find, at some point, a prosthetic limb (but it's just a leg, with no interesting accessories like Merle's replacement part). I have not read the comic version, but Amazon reviewer Brian Byrd gave me that heads up elsewhere.Episode 1 has several truly creepy scenese, not least of all is Rick's encounter with a young Irish ljazz in the forest. We also have lots of new survivors, most of them from Woodbury, home of the Crazy Governor.In the following episodes, a serious and highly contageous illness hits the prison compound. A high death rate and those who succumb reanimate. This does two things: it gives us a new story arc and gets rid of some of the newbies. By episode 4, we're back to our core group (mostly...heh heh). And the Zombies are rocking. More hordes and they're dangerous and frightening again. For most of Season 3, the poor Zeds were nothing more than pests. Unless you were tied to a chair and locked in a room with one, they posed no threat anymore. The survivors just swatted 'em like mosquitos. Season 4 has given them back their teeth.As always, the producers' ruthlessness in cutting cast members is still shaking things up. No one is Zombie proof or bullet proof and some of our original recipe survivors don't make it. Unfortunately Glenn is not among the victims. Sorry, but Season 3 was seriously marred by those endless ""let's drag in the kids"" scenes of Glen and Maggie making out.  Almost as sleep inducing as Rick and the Governor's staring contests.  We also lose two of my favorite original survivors by the end of Season 4, one by exile and one by the governor sawing off his head. Yep, the Guv continued to make trouble in Season 4, but in a more intersting way than in Season 3. No longer ""The Guv,"" he wants to be known simply as ""Brian."" But he's still nuttier than a fruitcake, just in a different way. I'm hoping the exiled character comes back. Not in the reanimated sense, just in the ""Hi Honey, I'm home"" way.Episode 4 is intense, exciting and gory. Everything you want from The Walking Dead.  I had to stop watching and take breaks from the action and mayhem once or twice.  The writers have really stepped things up. The Zoombas are on the march; the new characters are interesting, particularly a little girl who sometimes mistakes the Zs for pets (but not in that silly Michone way).Episodes 5 through 7 were just as good, and the season ender was a shocker. You have to give the writers and producers credit, they'll throw anyone to the wolves (or the zombies).  No one is guaranteed to survive until the time time. Makes for some really intense viewing.Let's hope next season remains reanimated or the producers will find it's their audience, not the dead, who are walking.",Walking Dead Comes Back to Life,1381708800,"10 14, 2013"
"The film starts out as a family moves once again. Single alcoholic mom (Mira Sorvino) has three children and can't hold a job.

Mom turns their dreams into nightmares with a train of abusive boyfriends, the latest of which has designs for Beth. The girls conspire along with two friends to make their lives better by eliminating the problem.Georgie Henley gave us a decent goth Fairuza Balk while Abigail Breslin was our slutty Barbie Doll.

"I was not really satisfied with the way that the judging went for this particular season  but it was so fun to watch!  I would have preferred for Mondo to win.  Although many of his designs were a bit over the top for my taste, he was who I considered to be the most talented.  My wife thought that Mondo's decision to include that white dress with the huge black polka dots in his final collection lost him him the support of Michael Kors, who had been critical of that design in the preliminary round.  But I liked that dress, so I felt that Mondo should have won.  As for the winner, Gretchen, I just did not like her designs.  It seemed like Heidi, though often critical of Gretchen, was always kind of pushing her along and supporting her come what may.  I think that Michael Kors really hit the nail on the head when he characterized Gretchen's designs as having a ""Lady of the Valley"" look.  These sort of loose beige earthen toned things were just not what I would consider elegant, sexy, or fun!  I also felt that April, the blond haired younger woman, was not given enough credit.  I loved her wild black edgy designs.  Andy clearly deserved to be in the final three  I particularly loved his bathing suit in one of the challenges.  In the end I felt that the final three should have been Mondo, Andy, and April.Casanova, one of the real characters in the competition, was fun to watch.  I particularly remember his weird dress that looked like it was about to slip off the hips of the model  and earned a few amusing comments from Michael Kors  who likened it to something appropriate for a belly dancer or stripper.  Michael Costello was interesting as well.  The poor guy was really maligned in one of the earlier challenges  and accused of being unable to sew.  To his credit, Mondo worked very earnestly with Michael in a team challenge which did much to rehabilitate Michael's image.  Michael was wonderful at draping  but I agreed with the judges that he did not belong as one of the final three.  I think that Michael achieved some kind of record low in his reaction to not making the final three.

"Hey, this turned out to be a far sweeter and interesting movie than I expected it to be.

"Not overly impressed with the show    it's just like every other Hoarder show. Some a little more disgusting than others. Pick those ones for the shock value only.Here's how it goes:&#34;People who hoard have issues and they usually wait until it's so far gone that they a) are getting evicted by their landlord or b) the county has deemed the house apartment trailer uninhabitable.&#34; That's the message through and through.The hoarder always has some reason for their behavior  and of course is reluctant to make any changes    this goes on for at least a half hour. There is a crazy family dynamic going on where family members are estranged from the hoarder, mad as can be and &#34;don't want nothing to do&#34; with the hoarder. They all haven't spoken for a long time.  Soooo,  bring in some specialist in the psychological issues of hoarding (really? there is such a thing? Well, now apparantly there IS! What an idiot job... sorry about wasting your perfectly good educationon a TV show. Probably getting paid great and it serves your ego oh so well to be the 'expert')Then the &#34;clean up crew&#34; (who look and sound like they are always advertising their services) show up and make predictible  comments on the mess of it all. Then they done protective gear and start the clean up job.There might be a crisis moment at the point the clean up is underway. Of course, there is a serious time crunch of like, oh... say: 48 hours. It's so serious at this point, because the hoarder was so reluctant for months, years... whatever... but no matter....the hoarder starts freaking out and has second thoughts about getting rid of some piece of cardboard or the bucket of poop (seriously, this was in one of the episodes I watched!!) and everything halts while the family gets ticked off again, walks out, vowing that they are DONE with this nonsense. Bring in that specialist and have a come to reason meeting.... on we go with the clean up.Everything turns out good in the end. Or maybe not. To be honest, I watched two shows and just ended up feeling disgusted that main stream entertainment has turned into such a freak show. It must be the &#34;train wreck&#34; mentally.And there are SEVERAL shows like this    some are &#34;Extreme Hoarder&#34; shows and some are &#34;Just Hoarder&#34; shows.

Now Miranda is dead and her spirit is roaming the earth for the other four friends to see is a little silly. Pretty Little Liars has more drama and mystery.

"Paid $9.99 to rent this primarily based on the two really glowing reviews left on here by people who called this the best movie they'd seen in a while etc.  Beware:  I think those reviewers might be marketing people working for the studio that put this out.I really like psychological thrillers, mysteries, horror, etc.  I like Selma Blair as well.  I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be, but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund.  It was terrible.  There's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes.  It's very obvious what's going on.The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting, as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen...and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation.  I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I don't like and who I wish would leave...but they can't take the hint.By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $9.99 on it and I just can't turn it off and not see the rest of it.This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and can't get to sleep.  I would never recommend this to anyone...definitely don't waste money on it and don't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5 stars and saying it is the best thing ever.I fell for that scam this time.

While there are some movie mistakes like where people seem to walk fast and step strong as if it was on our planet, and some questionable scenes, I found the plot to be quite interesting and good because it's different. Sure the walking dead people is one of those questionable things about the movie, it may not seem realistical, but I didn't care. It was interesting to see somethign new and different. it wasn't a stupid plot. Sure infected people may remind of zombies, but they are not zombies, they act different.

This one is even worse. The cop and his daughter are not only not interesting at all but the character of the daughter is something of a monster. I don't think there is a worse character in existence than some miserable pubescent teenager lashing out at everyone around them and with zero control of themselves. From Boris to her? It reminds me of the couple of episodes I saw of ""A Gifted Man"". No where near the intensity but I can't bear to watch an intelligent, highly skilled, and extremely generous person who saves people's lives be consistently treated like garbage by people.I still like the scenery, Divya, and Paige and some of the cases but the miserable people are given too much attention.

"6 Episodes on 2 Discs, released September 14, 2010""The League"" is a semi scripted comedy created by Jackie and Jeff Schaffer about a fantasy football league. This installment shows the first six episodes and it has been renewed for 13 episodes in the second season. It follows around men and their wives obsessed with football and how it interferes with their daily lives. One example of this is in the pilot, two lawyers are negotiating a plea bargain that involves some fantasy football trades in exchange for a shorter sentence for the criminal. Wow.Even without knowing much about football (though I bet it helps quite a bit), this is a comedy that can be enjoyed just poking fun at what losers they all are. Vulgar guy humor plus one of the most popular testosterone driven sports in existence equals a guy show. Usually I like guy shows, this isn't one of them. It's funny but actually gets pretty gross beyond my taste level which surprised me.There is situational humor with a couple trying to have a baby, a couple trying to get intimate after having a baby, the torture of wives who want you to sit at the dinner table when the game is on, the shame of your wife picking your team for you, trying to ensnare a child prophet to help you, and the challenge of trying to be on two leagues at the same time. I totally recommend this for guys who like vulgar humor and football. Everyone else can safely steer clear.Bonus Features:Since one character turned out to be a singer songwriter rapper, there are quite a few songs in full in the bonus features including ""Birthday Song"" about how a little girl was conceived, ""Vaginal Hubris"" about a proud vagina, and ""Legalize Kevin's Pubic Smoke"" encouraging legalization of a joint with Kevin's hair in it among others. Eww.There is a featurette for Andre called ""Dress with Style, Win with Style"" where he articulates the inspiration for his wannabe wardrobe that he gets picked on for anyway. There are a few more minor ones, but they aren't really worth discussing. You also get the pilot episode to a series called ""Archer"" which appears to be a cartoon James Bond ish series with vulgar humor.","Recommended for men who like football and vulgar humor, but doesn't connect to other audiences as well",1285804800,"09 30, 2010"

"This is a promising reboot of the Star Trek series, with the decided influence of JJ Abrams and friends. It's obviously hard to judge this one movie versus the existing Star Trek universe, but that's all we have for now.Skylar Spock definitely stole the show as he was is ideally suited to play a young Spock. Not quite as logical as Spock Prime   having an affair with a student is quite illogical after all. But as attempt #1 and playing a younger Spock one could not ask for a better performance.The rest of the characters need work in future movies before they establish themselves. New Kirk was a bit too much 90210, New Checkov was over done with the geekery TNG style, New McCoy felt out of phase at times, and New Sulu was not quite right. New Uhura and New Scottie are a step ahead of the rest of the main characters. Tyler Perry, talented and creative as he is, he was not very convincing as a high ranking Star Fleet officer. It sort of stood out.The other issue with the movie is that the villain du jour was actually not particularly impressive considering the grand stage. Other than the scary looking space ship, this was a typical TNG villain. The best they could come up with was an angry miner with a mining ship destroying the galaxy?On the plus site, Abrams and Crew paid a lot of attention to a number of details from the original Star Trek universe, mini homages to fans of TOS. Also very nice is the very efficient way they split the JJ Abrams Trek into a new timeline reality, thus not risking the wrath of TOS fans. This clean cut also opens up the possibility of more ""visitors"" from the original Trek timeline reality in future movies without ""ruining"" TOS :)","Promising reboot, entertaining movie, but has Trek issues",1261785600,"12 26, 2009"
"Like any Joss Whedon fan, I was excited to see his return to television. I grew up watching shows like Buffy and Angel, and have always been a diehard fan of Serenity's crew (those characters were tailored made for the actors who portrayed them). I have tried to like Agents of Shield, but I find myself doing other things not even halfway through the show. It just...lacks. There doesn't seem to be any coherent storyline being portrayed, none of the characters, other than the would be hacker spy, are being developed or given a background. Clark Gregg is a master of the subtle joke and his half smile is almost his signature look, yet his character is trying to be this hard azz, no nonsense sort of leader which I never saw him being in any of the movies. Yes, he took his job seriously, but always with a healthy dose of, ""Can you believe this s***z is happening?"" The two geeky lab rats need to be put in the airlock and left there at 40,000 feet with the door open; perhaps then they wouldn't be quite so annoying to listen to. Why do unimaginably intelligent people have to be portrayed as wacky or skewed? Ming Na is just sort of there; a character with this apparent bad azz reputation we only get glimpses of in offhand remarks. Yet, she is relegated to airplane pilot? The male agent is seriously just there as eye candy, to hopefully bring in some younger women into the view. I feel bad for the actor, really, his character is about as shallow and typical as they come. I hope that in the future the show finds its true sea legs and settles down into the kickazz show it could be. If the studio is worried about it becoming another, ""Firefly,"" where the show was more character interaction than action (and was so much better for it), and thinks the audience wants all action and no substance, then perhaps they should let this show become the next ""Firefly"" because I for one would be a fan for life if I saw that same charisma  in A.o.S.","High expectations, low reality",1382400000,"10 22, 2013"

"The disaster of the city of Pompeii took place in the year 79 AD and has really become more of a tragic legend than fact.  Although historians are aware of the time frame in which the volcano, Mount Vesuvius, erupted &#8211; along with having some names of people that died in the catastrophe &#8211; that&#8217;s really all they know.  With that in mind, the imagination and fictitious accounts make up the storyline for the period adventure flick, Pompeii.Paul W. S. Anderson (Resident Evil, Mortal Kombat) directs the epic, Pompeii &#8211; starring Kit Harington as Milo.  As a young boy, Milo watched as the Romans slaughtered his people (and parents), led by a dastardly soldier, Corvus (Kiefter Sutherland).  Although Milo survived the attack, he was captured and thrown into slavery, eventually becoming a lethal gladiator.  In fact, he&#8217;s so lethal that his master, Graecus (Joe Pingue), decides to move him to a grander stage in the city of Pompeii.On the way to Pompeii, the lives of Milo and a wealthy merchant&#8217;s daughter, Cjazzia (Emily Browning), become intertwined.  Shortly thereafter, Milo learns he must fight Pompeii&#8217;s gladiator champion, Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje) &#8211; but prior to their showdown, the two men form a surprising and unsuspecting friendship.  At the same time, the man that killed Milo&#8217;s family, Corvus, comes to town and is now a well respected (and feared) Roman senator.Corvus has been looking for Cjazzia (whom he desperately wants to marry) and quickly notices the growing bond that has formed between Cjazzia and Milo.  In an effort to dispose of Milo, Corvus puts both Atticus and Milo in the Pompeii coliseum for the fight of their lives &#8211; a fight in which they are sure to lose their lives.  However, without any warning, a volcano outside the city erupts thrusting everyone into a panic as the sky rains with fire and ash.For the fans of the popular film, Gladiator, the plot of Pompeii will appear to be extremely familiar.  Both feature a storyline that is driven by revenge after the death of the main character&#8217;s family.  But, Pompeii is certainly no Gladiator and the fact that both films are being used in the same sentence is borderline outrageous.  Still, it&#8217;s hard to ignore the similarities between the two movies &#8211; prompting Pompeii to easily be labeled as a dreaded Gladiator &#8220;knockoff.&#8221;Kit Harington, who is most recognizable from his starring role in the popular HBO drama, Game of Thrones, plays a character that we&#8217;ve seen countless times in the past &#8211; and again is much like the lead character in Gladiator (although Harington is a far cry from the masterful Russell Crowe).  Milo is cold as ice on the outside, but clearly filled with righteous emotions on the inside.  He&#8217;s been driven by revenge his whole life, but once he lays his eyes on the beautiful &#8220;princess,&#8221; suddenly his heart melts and he has new meaning to live.If you happen to be a fan of Jon Snow (Harington&#8217;s Game of Thrones character), then you should find just as much enjoyment in the Milo character.  Harington literally looks like he walked of the set of Game of Thrones and jumped right into Pompeii.  In fact, the two characters are so similar that it will be almost impossible to tell them apart.  Unfortunately, it&#8217;s difficult to determine whether or not that&#8217;s a good thing or a bad thing.  Really, the only bothersome part of Harington&#8217;s character in Pompeii is that it&#8217;s filled with far too many holes since viewers will have no idea what happened to the character from childhood to adulthood &#8211; although one could jazzume he was constantly in chains.The main character depth issue, which plagues many films that have previously attempted to do too much in too little time &#8211; evident in films like John Carter and Prince of Persia, also hampers Pompeii.  Several lead characters, like Emily Browning&#8217;s Cjazzia or Kiefer Sutherland&#8217;s Corvus, are nothing more than randomly in the wrong place at the wrong time &#8211; sort of like anyone that was aboard the Titanic.  Sadly, the ambitions of these two vague, aloof characters are never fully realized, and are poorly reduced to taking part in an under whelming love triangle.Storyline aside, the CGI is also an issue that takes away from the film.  For roughly the first half of the film, the actors are mostly able to avoid the dreaded green screen.  However, as the volcano begins to erupt and the coliseum fighting ensues, the CGI becomes unbearably frequent &#8211; and is about as believable as the CGI used in Paul W. S. Anderson&#8217;s Resident Evil films.  If you&#8217;ve sat through other disaster flicks, like 2012 or Armageddon, then Pompeii will give off a similar feeling of disappointment with the over abuse of computer graphics.Overall, Pompeii is a film that will appeal more to Game of Thrones lovers and moviegoers that enjoy gladiator tales.  The story is far from unique, but that doesn&#8217;t stop it from being a semi entertaining adventure flick.  It progresses at an intense pace and features plenty of action (even though most of it is noticeably fake).  Everlasting love is apparently the theme of the story, but by the time the credits roll, I suspect most viewers will feel as though they wasted their time watching a film that is filled with nothing more than death, disappointment, and shattered expectations.  $100 million is far too much to spend of the movie of this nature and even though it is an average &#8220;popcorn&#8221; film, the disappointing finale will leave the majority of viewers uttering, &#8220;that&#8217;s it?&#8221;GRADE:  C FNDNreview.com",'Pompeii' tragic in more ways than one.,1393286400,"02 25, 2014"

"Intended as a brutal, cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre, it felt like the intensity was declawed, domesticated and rendered family friendly.  However, at times the character dynamic in this ridiculous scenario makes the movie at least watchable, although still falling short of recommendable.Iris (Brittany Snow) is a good person with a good heart who finds herself in a difficult situation.  Her parents are dead, she has no money and no job, and she is left to care for her terminally ill brother.  Philanthropist Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) offers Iris an opportunity to change her life in the form of an invitation to a dinner party that offers a solution to all of her foreseeable problems, financial or otherwise.  Upon arrival, Iris finds herself among similarly desperate individuals all looking to make some money.  Basically, this is Dinner for Schmucks if the schmucks were financially desperate and the hosts wanted to morally bankrupt them one sadistic challenge at a time.The guests include a mix of transients, gamblers, young and old, able and wheelchair bound, friendly and unfriendly.  Completely out of left field, one of them is played by porn star Sasha Grey.  But the real wild card in this rated R truth or dare is going to be the sweet, naive old lady in the wheelchair.  What is she going to do to people?  What are people going to do to her?It starts out with mean spirited intentions  masked as helping people  in the form of paying a vegetarian to eat steak and fois gras and coercing an alcoholic to binge drink fine scotch. But they quickly graduate to things like ""would you rather electrocute yourself or Iris?""  Then lashings, stabbings, drowning and some other seemingly mundane, poorly executed,  unshocking punishments.  Even things that should have been hard to watch (in the hands of a different director) were presented in subdued, PG 13 form. Really, I could watch this with my grandmother.  She's seen Goodfellas and The Godfather, both of which have more scares, shocks and brutality than this.Iris is clearly meant to serve as the audience's moral compjazz.  But I never found myself rooting for her, nor caring about her or any of the other characters...except for maybe the transient, selfish Amy (Sasha Grey), the first one who realized how to get out of this alive.  In fact, from the start Amy really embraced the concept and celebrated the challenges as a malevolent force.Fledgling director David Guy Levy likely intended this to be a brutal, cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre.  However, I felt that the intensity was declawed.  I felt no suspense.  But I did enjoy watching the character dynamic as people tried to rationalize their ""would you rather"" options.  A task that, again, Amy really owned.  So while I was disappointed by the near gorelessness, watching the ""game"" still offered sufficient entertainment.A major shock was that the best performance wasn't by horror king Jeffrey Combs or Pitch Perfect (2012) favorite Brittany Snow.  The only convincing character was Sasha Grey's coarse portrayal of Amy.  But there were no shocks from schlock, gore, moral corruption, torture, cruelty or even the lame attempt a surprise twist ending.  Oh, and the old, sweet nave lady in the wheelchair?  Totally under , or even un utilized; mishandled by too much restraint while directing a film in which there should be no restraint!  What a waste.If you are looking for jaw drops, you won't find them in Would You Rather.  I would only recommend this to someone who watches no fewer than four horror movies per week.  Really.  Like four.  As in, you probably systematically try to watch all horror ever anyway and won't listen to me as I try to warn you away.",The most family-friendly contribution ever to the torture porn subgenre; horribly mismanaged by a fledgling director,1375488000,"08 3, 2013"

"I should start by saying I'm not much of a musical fan. But I do think it would be much better if the singing actually sounded good and matched what the actors were saying, instead of it being so obvious it's a track. Something about the way it was made looks amateurish    definitely the least professional looking of the five pilots I've watched today. That said, I got some genuine laughs out of Dustin Ingram's performance, and I think the other actors could do better with more to work with, since a pilot is essentially just introductions. Even though I'm not crazy about the songs, I think this show could be campy fun with a few improvements.

"Original post after first 4 episodes:  Writing is more solid and interesting, great character development too.  They had been stuck in a bit of a rut.Update Dec 7:  Spoke too soon.  The started out well post Ziva, had interesting plots and did some nice development on the various regulars.  But now apparently they decided they have to copy all the other crime shows that bring in some quirky specialist that solves everything while the rest of the cast stand around and oh yeah, they have to put a female in for the guys.  This does not work, does not fit the NCIS prior seasons where each team member has abilities and they solve things because they work together, and makes me regret I bought a season pjazz for #11.  I think they wanted to put in a character that can just come up with the answer doing a Sherlock routine so they don't have to figure out a plot line to explain how the team knows what to do.

"V H S is a hybrid of the old and new traditions of horror movie where they take a good ol' fashioned anthology and mix it up with modern hand held camera angles. Let's see how each segment did on it's own shall we?Tape 56 Main Arc: Interesting ideas that could've been executed better. A group of thugs are given a job to break into a house and retrieve a VHS tape, but they don't know which one. So a random guy is jazzigned to watch a tape with a dead body in the room, and when each segment ends someone disappears and the dead body has moved slightly. As I said, interesting idea but not much is revealed, pretty much everything I said about it is all you see about it, so if they elaborated more on this story it could've benefited greatly.Amateur Night: A trio of dumb young guys (a prominent feature throughout V H S) go out on a mission to get laid, and they pick up a normal drunk chick and a very odd looking girl that has warning signs blaring all over, which the guys seem oblivious to until she's tearing one of their chest's apart. This was the highlight of V H S for me, with graphic violence, creepy make up, and some genuinely unsettling scenes for a horror veteran, this was a perfect segment. I'd rate this (5 5)Second Honeymoon: Interesting idea with an anti climactic payoff. A man and wife are having their second honeymoon (hence the title) and the first scene you see is them going to a fortune teller who gives them a bad omen. After the frightening Amateur Night this was quite a let down, the only creepy scene was when they realized a woman was outside asking for a ride and loitering outside, but just because I was expecting something to happen. As the story goes on the random woman gets into their hotel and videotapes herself above them sleeping, which would be creepy if I hadn't seen Silence of the Lambs before, which did that same idea much better over 20 years ago. In the end the wife actually plotted her husband's murder and the random woman is her lesbian lover, which could've worked, except the entire conclusion was rushed and just felt like a sucker punch to the face. I know Ti West (the director) is critically acclaimed among some people but I think he just sucks, House of the Devil was completely unmemorable (oh it's vintage! NEVERMIND!) and the Innkeepers was a snooze fest with a predictable climax. So for Ti West standards it is ok, but compared to Amateur Night it was pretty stupid. (2 5)Tuesday the 17th: Uh oh, the segments are starting to go downhill now. Four days after Friday the 13th a group of college students go out to some isolated woods to smoke weed and flirt, while one of the girls is acting strange. Again the setup was interesting, as the video camera seems to glitch out and show random dead bodies in certain locations, but as the story progresses half the cast gets killed out of nowhere, and the last girl reveals that another group of her friends were murdered in the same location and she's now trying to catch the killer, using her current friends as bait. The catch is the killer is never clearly shown through the camera and has implied supernatural powers, all of which just didn't make sense and wasn't built up well. (1 5)The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger: Interesting idea, more of a payoff here (but not much). The whole segment is shown through Skype segments with Emily talking with her despondent boyfriend. She believes that there are ghosts in her house, and that her room is haunted while the boyfriend is trying to calm her down and promise her that she's not going crazy. This segment utilized suspense a lot better than the last two segments, especially with Emily walking around her apartment with her eyes closed instructing her boyfriend to tell her if there's anything there. Again though, the twist is straight out of the left field, where they're in fact aliens harvesting embryos from her body, and the boyfriend is in on it, as it ends with him talking to another random girl on Skype. The twist was almost unnecessarily weird, and would've been just as effective if the boyfriend had no idea what was going on and we just watched something weird sick happening to Emily, but at least it was ambitious and set itself up well. (3 5)10 31 98: Like the first segment, a bunch of guys are out on Halloween looking for a good time, and for whatever reason enter a seemingly vacant house looking for 'da party'. When they reach the attic they see a bunch of cult members about to sacrifice a woman, and pull her out as the cult members are grabbed by hands from the ceiling and pulled out of sight, and when the guys are escaping the house some of the craziest s*** happens in this segment, with doorknobs disappearing and crows flying out of rooms, the segment really has to be seen to be believed. Finally the guys escape the warping house and soon realize that the lady was in fact possessed and the cult members were preforming an exorcism, so she escapes the car and leaves them on train tracks for a train to wipe them out as she goes wandering the streets. The ending could've been a lot creepier but it was still a very unique and fascinating watch. (Although I'm getting tired of seeing hands come through the wall, it all started with a youtube video ((The hand demon)), then Grave Encounters did it, and now this did it, it's starting to get old). (4 5)So overall V H S started strongly, sulked during the middle, then concluded on a high note. Three of the stories were well done while the other two were weak sauce, although the nice thing about anthologies is if it gets boring you know the movie will move on in ten minutes or so. So V H S was a bumpy but consistently fun ride as I didn't know what to expect next, and a horror movie covering succubi to lesbian murders to glitched out serial killers to aliens to possessed haunting, that's a pretty darn good horror movie. It's too bad the segments couldn't have been consistent but I hope V H S gets popular because maybe, just maybe, there'll be more of a demand for horror anthologies in general.*Edit: A side note about the nudity, it's been awhile since I've seen V H S but I remember it being in Amateur Night and TSTTHTEWSWY was that in amateur night it made sense with the lore of the creature and ultimately made her appearance creepier, while in TSTTHTEWSWY the reason Emily's boyfriend wanted to see her naked body was simply for harvesting purposes, so I'd argue that in those cases it worked with the context of the stories.","Brilliantly Original, Uneven Payoff (Spoilers)",1347753600,"09 16, 2012"
"Nothing new or spectacular about this show. With cable TV uping it's game network TV has to be more creative in its storytelling, dialogue, plot and character development.

"Set in the year 2707, a sci fi action film ""Mutant Chronicles"" revolves around a group of soldiers on a mission to stop and destroy the ""Machine"" deep under the ground, that turn humans (dead or alive) into hostile ""mutants."" Though the storyline sounds very familiar (""Resident Evil,"" for instance), it has got potential. It could be a very enjoyable film with well made actions, which ""Mutant Chronicles"" sadly lacks.""Mutant Chronicles"" offers lots of battle scenes, some of which are violent and gory. As to the gore and violence of ""Mutant Chronicles,"" I have little to no problem with them simply because they are not very impressive here. Murky photography, badly staged actions and bland choreography only make the viewers feel ""What is happening?"" And you have to sit through the convoluted, sometimes implausible story. I like the designs of weapons and machines, but the obvious use of special effects is very disappointing.The cast is interesting: Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, Devon Aoki, Sean Pertwee, Benno F&uuml;rmann and Anna Walton, who was Princess Nuala in ""Hellboy II."" John Malkovich briefly shows up as a religious leader, but he has little to do in the story.""Mutant Chronicles"" is based on the game franchise. Well, that's what they say. I don't know anything about the source material, but I judge from what I read on the net (including some commentaries from the angry reviewers) that the film's story is not very faithful to the game universe.

"Having finished watching Stephen Frears' ""Lay the Favorite,"" I am still unsure what to make of this ""true story"" based on Beth Raymer's memoir of her experiences in the sports betting industry in Las Vegas. The film has one interesting subject matter, to be sure, and benefits from the fine performance from Rebecca Hall as the spirited heroine, but with its unfocused and disjointed narrative ""Lay the Favorite"" simply doesn't know what it is doing.An in home exotic dancer Beth travels from Florida to Las Vegas, dreaming of becoming a cocktail waitress at a casino. As luck would have it, she gets a job working for a bookie Dink Heimowitz (Bruce Willis). Beth, who is good with numbers, becomes a sort of good luck charm for Dink and even gets romantically involved with him before his wife Tulip (Catherine Zeta Jones) comes back and interferes.The story may sound interesting. Actually, it is not, jumping from one scene to the next without developing any of the characters. In ""Lay the Favorite"" you will never know anything about the betting industry. That itself is not a big problem if the film allows us to know the characters. Beth meets characters played by Corbin Bernsen, Frank Grillo, Joshua Jackson, John Carroll Lynch, Laura Prepon and Vince Vaughn. The impressive cast does their best, but frankly, we really don't care what happen to these uninteresting cyphers.The only exception to the mediocre writing is the film's protagonist Beth, who, thanks to Rebecca Hall, remains attractive even when her character is not really credible. Despite her effective acting, ""Lay the Favorite"" seems trying not to entertain us, by omitting or blurring critical points of her story that should be more interesting.",What a Waste of Great Talents,1381449600,"10 11, 2013"

"As MST3k is sort of a show within a show within a movie concept, I think it is better to look at the individual parts of the episode to determine if the episode works in totalThe Movie: After finding a relic from Venus, an international team of scientists are sent to Venus to determine why Venus will not respond to Earth's radio signals.  This is a very serious and straight forward science movie that has more in common with ""2001"" and ""Star Trek"" than the normal MST3k cheesefests like ""King Dinosaur"".  It is also sort of dry with most of the movie being about the scientists interacting with each other and performing scientific experiments while traveling in their spaceship.  And yet I found myself sort of caring about the team and I became very interested when they finally arrived on the alien surface of Venus.Host Segments: The invention exchange segment is extremely funny due to the interaction between Frank and Dr. Forrester   both seem to enjoy brewing around during the skit.  The remaining segments range from bad to ok.  Even worse, Joel plays around with Tom Servo's sarcasm meter.  It is supposed to be fixed by movie sign but yet Tom keeps spouting a sarcastic comment that quickly wears thin.Riffs: Joel and the bots start and end strong but the riffing is very sparse for most of the movie (the part when the scientists are on the ship).  There are moments when an entire minute pjazzes before the next riff.  Except for the first and last ten minutes, the riffs were not all that funny with the occasional chuckle.  And Tom constantly saying ""Ooooo... &lt;&lt;Sarcastic remark>> Sign me up!"" went from mildly funny to quickly annoying by the end of the movie.Overall: I am a big fan of MST3k and will probably have to turn in my red jumpsuit for saying this but... I actually became annoyed with the crew as the few riffs in this episode always come when something important was about to be explained.  I guess I started to pay too much attention to movie during the riffing silence and found myself actually caring more about the movie than when the next riff would be delivered.  I would grade this episode a slightly below average episode with a slightly boring but yet watchable movie offset by bad segments and riffing that reminded me of season 1.",A very serious movie with a low riff rate; you might like the movie more than the MST3k part,1354492800,"12 3, 2012"

"Admittedly I was mesmerized by Nicolas Winding Refn's ""Drive"" from 2011 and went back and looked at ""Valhalla Rising,"" his film from 2009.  I found it ponderously slow, solemn and extremely violent, but with a great artistic sense and terrific production values.  ""Only God Forgives"" is much closer to ""Valhalla Rising"" than it is to ""Drive.""  The biggest problem is that the movie is ridiculous from a story line perspective.Early on, I was putting too much thought into what was going on.  With a style closest perhaps to David Lynch with a bit of Terrence Malick tossed in, mobster Julian (Ryan Gosling) and police detective Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm) appear to be 2 sides of the same coin.  Julian's brother and fellow criminal is killed at the hand of the father of a 16 year old prostitute.  Even though daddy was also her pimp (""I've got 4 daughters and no son, so how else are they going to support me?""), she wasn't supposed to be brutally murdered.  When Chang gives dear old dad the option of being the executioner, he accepts.  Chang of course expects there will be reprisals but dad deserves it.Kristin Scott Thomas is over the top in her platinum wigged mob boss and mother of the two brothers.  Crystal loved the slain older brother and makes no bones about it to Julian.  She's there for revenge.  Not only the pimp dad, but all the police who were involved and even some who weren't.Like ""Valhalla"" this film is light on dialog and that's probably a good thing because what almost saves it, is the look of the film.

"While season 2 turned out to be the weak point of the series it was far from being terrible.  The first season gave us the introduction of the hero characters and their individual stories and plots for why they did what they did,  the second and the rest of the season gave us more on the superhero plotline stories rather then the secret identity story plot it felt like.  While there are a few characters who felt they weren't needed it didn't detract from the enjoyment I got from watching the show, and for the price the set is going for right now I feel it's forgivable especially since this is the shortest season of the four seasons the show as on the air.  The video and audio are great with nice clarity and sound especially as you hear the background sound.  So again while this wasn't the greatest season it's still and enjoyable enough season to add to your dvd library anyway considering what the price for the set is going for it's a pretty reasonable bargain....",While Not The Greatest Season Not All That Bad Either,1338336000,"05 30, 2012"
"I wish I had access to material like this when my children were young! Morgan Freeman provides just the right pacing and tone in this DVD that explores some very deep philosophical questions from the viewpoint of the edges of science. I did not find this to be ""new agey"" as some reviewers did; I thought it raised questions that made science sound interesting, not dull, and led to some great discussions among my family and friends who watched. I also watched a few of the physics segments in conjunction with reading theThe 4 Percent Universe: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality. It was a nice overview of dark matter, etc.Not a boring science lesson, but some adventures that are exciting, well produced and have some visual effects that will blow you away.

"The concept is engaging  a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening  with varying success.  The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals.  This is a single, plot line show where a dual plot line  one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time  would have provided depth and thought provoking meaning for audiences.  The female protagonist is excellent.  The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be, I believe.  If you want something border line sci fi and still engaging, try Warehouse 13, Touched, or 666 Park Avenue.","After the first few episodes, you've probably seen enough",1363132800,"03 13, 2013"

To this point I have viewed all but one of the first session's episodes and I cannot say that I find the evidence convincing. That may not be the goal of the program; perhaps it is intended to entertain or stir up frisson in its viewers. No differences from ghost sightings from the 20th century except now we have digital cameras and video and audio recorders. Most sightings happen in poor lighting and on camera or video only  no one sees them at the time the photo is taken or the recording is made.

"Sebastian Faulks' novel is highly regarded.  I've not read it, but I'll take people's word that it's good.  Abi Morgan is a talented screenwriter whose work I've enjoyed    most recently, the series ""The Hour"" and the film ""Shame"".  So I should've liked ""Birdsong"".  But for whatever reason, the potential in this project just didn't gel into anything particularly great.  Perhaps the series needed to be longer:  the love story feels rushed; Eddie Redmayne's compatriots in the trenches just seem like quick sketches; and then it's over.  Well, it's not over before we're given the moral of story, delivered by a guy tragically dying in the trenches.  ""It's all we're good for,"" the guy croakingly soothsays to Redmayne, while the strings weep in the background.  ""To love and be loved.""  (Hopefully this scene is not in the novel.)But before we get to that pearl of wisdom, we must endure a lot of staring into the middle distance, mostly from Redmayne as he reminiscences about his lost love while in the trenches.  The director was rather cruel to Redmayne, I should think.  The guy is asked to look tragic throughout the whole picture, even in the pre war scenes.  He's asked to break down and sob a few times.  Actors hate that, by the way.  Worst of all, he's asked to whisper.  A lot.  Almost his entire dialogue is whispered.  If you don't have a decent home theater system with Dolby, you are well advised to turn on the Closed Captioning, unless you enjoy alternating your volume up and down between whispering and bombshells.  I think some directors confuse whispered dialogue with Important Dialogue.The heart of the thing is the love story, but, as I said earlier, the story is too rushed for us to start really rooting for the lovers to come together.  There is some nice intensity between them as they steal glances at each other and play some footsie on a rowboat (for once, all the staring works to a purpose), but it's just not enough.  The lady is married to an impotent man, conveniently enough, and I think she's supposed to be about 10 or so years older than Redmayne.  But Clemence Poesy appears to be the same age as Redmayne, so it's strange when she calls him ""my boy"", and it's even stranger when the 16 year old daughter of the husband's first marriage calls Poesy ""maman"".  Poesy seems like a fine actor, but this is a Casting Fail.As for the rest of it:  there's a Gallipoli like futile charge against the Germans that fails because of incompetent planning by the military brjazz, but really, haven't we seen all this before?  In fact, we've seen it in ""Gallipoli"", a superior movie directed by Peter Weir.  I couldn't connect with the soldiers' mission, and I couldn't connect with them.  One of them wears sweaters, sent from his mother back in England, over his army issue.  Couldn't tell you anything else about him, though.  Perhaps Abi Morgan needed to spend more time on them.  Perhaps the producers needed a bigger budget to expand the series.Or, and here's a thought, maybe the original novel the series is based on isn't all that good to begin with, contrary to received opinion.  All that I learned from ""Birdsong"" is that War, and French Ladies, are Hell.  Tell me something I don't know!  2 out of 5.",War and French ladies,1380326400,"09 28, 2013"

"It is so nice to see so many new shows that are born from the horror genre in recent years. Some are good and some not so much, so my jury is still out on this show. The shows cast is a mix of age groups  and hopefully will continue to be written for a broad fan base age group and not just for the teens to 20 + like the wave that's already out there.The setting for the show is in the early years of Salem Mjazz. and under the Puritan's rule of law when witches and witchcraft was that time periods evil terrorists with WMD's.The writing seems to be pretty solid with good direction and some welcome faces in its cast. The settings, backdrops, clothing and storyline all help to add a dark tone and mood for the show which I enjoyed seeing. I have my fingers crossed for this show and its hopeful evolution into a good series if they don't mess things up.There is a fair amount of cursing without the f word as well as blood and gore. There were a few sex scenes with full backside and partial front male and partial front female without exposed breasts nudity M F and some twisted witches bodily feeding sites like a nipple on a thigh?I have enjoyed the show and continue to watch new episodes each week with the hope that the shows direction turns away from the soap like format. I also hope that the writing direction will not continue to make the witches movements so obvious to the members of Salem or their viewers.

"Not a good sign when the build up for the film was some of the better parts of this Disaster Torture Porn movie. Eli Roth presents: Some South American guy's idea for a horror film, and while he does deserve credit for coming up with an original idea that was pretty neat in theory, a lot of stupid decisions happen after the aftermath that took me far out of the film.So the Positives: Acting was good (enough), most of the characters had enough depth to them to make their roles pjazzable (except for girl in white dress who did nothing), and there was some good set up (which is usually the low point for these films). The story was unpredictable and the ol' ""who gets killed first"" list was pretty unpredictable. So yeah, Aftershock at it's best is unpredictable and original, with interesting ideas for a story.Now for the not so good: Pretty much everything after the first friend dies. While the movie was unpredictable, everything that happened afterward was predictably cruel and unusual. Especially scenes that were basically ""stay here while we get help"", which happened at least three times with the same results: bad stuff happens. The bad stuff, is mostly caused by a small gang of prison inmates released after the earthquake, who seem more focused on rape then escaping far from prison or even regarding their own safety during the aftermath of the earthquake. Nope, instead they chase down our 'heroes' for the entire film after s*** hits the fan. If I were a prison inmate watching this, I'd feel insulted.Also the characters act pretty dumb and slow for most of the movie, when people need help, they awkwardly fumbled for 5 minutes or so until they realized the obvious solutions. They do other dumb s*** throughout the movie, like when one of them's told to stay put, and stay quiet, he immediately phones someone and gives away his location. When a hysteric woman is pointing a gun at someone and threatens to shoot, the character starts walking towards her. When *spoilers* an inmate is dressed as a firefighter, he plays a rather convincing one that would contradict his actions, helping the men and trying to isolate the women with him, so he can... kill them? ...ok. There's a lot of head scratchers like that throughout the film, which not only pulled me out of the immersion, but also made for a rather dumb movie with pointless excessive suffering. Hence, the Torture Porn element that Eli Roth is known for. The problem is, the story could've been fine without the murderous rampaging rapists. S*** they could've even been a local gang or something, but even then, maybe just one scene with them being a threat. But being chased the entire movie by the prisoners? C'mon...So for a horror disaster movie, it was certainly original and unpredictable, which is very welcome for the tired and stale genre. I'd probably watch the next film by South American dude, since there's some potential here. But next time he makes a movie, cut out the stupidity and unnecessary torture, because it's getting pretty stale.","Um, Nice Try?",1369526400,"05 26, 2013"
"Every once is a blue moon someone makes an excellent movie or tv version of a Stephen King novel. This is not one of those times.

"This series starts well, and for the first episodes promises to be a great Brit mystery   detective   serial killer story. The signs of the disaster are however there from the beginning  overacted, over analyzed personal issues and relations, too many conflicts for a conflicted smart detective and a bunch of bad bosses. Once the thing starts to go down, it simply becomes painful to watch. The plot regarding the investigation, which is good, gets diluted amid unappealing and impossible to believe piles of personal drama. Mind you, the wife of the good detective starts overnight hating her beloved husband because he cannot solve a series of crimes in which the victims are women. This seem to clearly show her that he is a chauvinist who does not care about her. This silly plot line would have made some mild sense if it were not because the detective character not only seems not to be chauvinist but also is spending nights and weekends trying to solve the case, putting up with insufferable bosses, and ruining his career trying to solve the crimes. But the endless insane scenes of matrimonial fights are terrible and cut any mystery line. The fact that later the detective starts an affair with a female detective that, predictably, does not work and ends up involving more insufferable senseless relationship dialogues does not help. Neither does that every boss who is put in charge of the investigation is both and idiot and a bad police. I mean, of course no one will solve these crimes.

As for surreal, absurd parts that take us behind the scenes   out of the movie, that's pretty old as well (examples: BLAZING SADDLES, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL).

"This show is terrible, shoddy acting, unbelievable storylines, the montages with awful cover songs, etc etc.1. The supposed ""good guys"" are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right, I could care less about them. That's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it's actually painful to watch.

"We open up with Vance splitting the team up, why you ask. To catch a mole,  now normally these make for good episodes. But NCIS actually manages to brew it up, it would have been better had Vance let Gibbs know in advance what was going to happen, but no. Ziva is back at Mjazzad, Mcgee in the cybercrimes unit, And Dinozzo and agent afloat. Now I don't like the Vance character, as a matter of fact, he brings absolutely nothing to the show. We find out that Gibbs endorsed agent langer, who replaced Dinozzo, the girl that Jimmy Palmer was seeing in earlier seasons, is all of a sudden a mole. Who kills Langer, but made it look like he was the mole. I'm serious, season six just jumps and zigzags all over the place, with stories that don't make sense. And they feel like they were put together at the last minute, Tony is finally brought home, and the team is rejazzembled. Now, I have always said. I would like to see a more confident Mcgee, and they tried to that in an episode called ""Caged"" where he has to get a confession from a female serial killer in a women's prison, one of the few bright spots of the season. But after this episode, he goes back to being Dinozzo's whipping post. We do meet Gibbs's dad, the only true shining moment of the season. We get a decent episode about Ducky's past in "" Broken Bird"" but the episode is so drawn out, I fell asleep halfway through it. Abby gets an episode by herself that's not bad, not great, buuuuuut it's okay. We get a cross over with NCIS LA, a two parter. Now my major problem with the ending, is all of a sudden. Ziva knows a Mjazzad operative is in the country, going after the same people NCIS is going after, and she doesn't tell Gibbs. Nor anybody else, except Dinozzo has figured it out. And tries to give her a chance to come clean, Dinozzo with the blessing of Gibbs, keeps digging. And confronts the operative, who is also Ziva's boyfriend. Which leads to a confrontation in Ziva's apt. Where Tony has no choice but to kill the guy, now this whole storyline comes out of no where. The whole season even felt like a soap opera, particulalry when at the end, they're getting ready to leave Isreal, and Ziva tells Gibbs she must stay, even  after Tony proved he was innocent, she still didn't trust him. Yeah, season six is okay, but my conclusion is this, seasons 1 4 are the golden years, season 5 8 are the so so to bad years, season nine is great.",the continuing decline,1346976000,"09 7, 2012"

"I know I'm in the lone minority here, but this show used to be funny and cutting edge and hilarious. This season was not what I had hoped for; it was too dark and preachy and felt like NBC's Parenthood   which I'm not a fan of... It's as if someone told Louie, the only way the show could return was to compromise on elements.And I'm going to say it: I don't get the whole thing with Louie's ex wife.... I know it was addressed in interviews back in season 3, and the actress playing his ex wife was so good, blah, blah, blah.. and that's nice, but the problem is that it's not believable, on any level, so it doesn't seem genuine, regardless of the acting. I haven't seen anything this confusing since we saw Michael Jackson's kids, and he always insisted they were his biological children...riiight... I'm all for diversity and relationships, etc..., but let's be real... and I think it's more of this subliminal forced melding we're supposed to be doing in society, and it's kinda creepy, to the point where fiction is blurred to be believed as fact, and darn anyone who questions the reality or inconsistencies; like we're all are supposed to be playing  ""the real world isn't the real world game"". If it were a case where these girls were adopted, fine, that's realistic, but to say they're her ""biological"" kids is an insult to anyone with any intelligence.That said, I liked seeing Ellen Burstyn and Charles Grodin... and there were some comical moments, but for the most part, this season was like a weird bad dream after eating rich food earlier in the evening... I mean, that whole bat to the piano was not the workings of a sane individual; unless this is the point, which is horrible too.. and that whole flashback in Elevator part 4's episode was horrible; the guy who played Louie didn't look anything like Louie. The two episode flashback to Louie's' younger 8th grade years were horrible too..it was like watching a whole different series (Wonder Years lite), and it was another example of how this series is now just a stumble and stab at random stuff in the dark until the 22 or 23 mins runs out and they can quick flash those closing credits to say, ""Ahh, another episode done!"".

"Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966. That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission. The guys, too, while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes, came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made, there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle, which relies more on old fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags. While having little more to do than show her body, deliver a few accented lines, and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double, Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope. Phyllis Diller, a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years, does her particular thing well. True she was an acquired taste, as they say, but in this film, she does provide some fun. The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs. Hope, himself, nearing the end of his film career, has better material and, therefore, more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America's favorite comic here and abroad. At this time, he had something like one third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops, most recently in Viet Nam, where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs, no irony or wit, no character development, no symbolic meanings, a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags, I can, still laughing, recommend this as feather light, totally escape, viewing.",One of the Best of Hope's Late Films,1273968000,"05 16, 2010"

"I find myself waiting for the next episode each week.  Though I find myself already enveloped in this series, that is usually when it doesn't make it into a second season...The season has just started, on the few episodes, they are predictive.  What I mean by that is thus far: you see child and fugitive running from the law and the people who will exploit her, child finds a what I call a broken soul, and is compelled to fix the situation, The law catches up to the child and fugitive, child will on occasion display super telekinetic abilities, then child and fugitive get away.Sounds very simple, yes, but again it is well made, and the actors have a way of drawing you into the series.  If not careful in my opinion, the show can be the prey to same base plots and over time lose viewers.

The cast is good, i like the casting of everyone, but it just can't seem to get going. the characters and situations have no depth, they just skim across the surface, sadly. the beauty of the books is the backstory and the interaction between vic and longmire, and bear and longmire. both of those relationships are drastically changed int he tv series, much to its detriment. additionally one of the best elements of the story, the reclusive indian (cannot remember the characters name) is missing entirely from this version. ugh. just terrible. won't be purchasing any more episodes.",2nd season starts out with a whimper,1396828800,"04 7, 2014"

Any other kidnapper would have blown out one of his kneecaps; not show him pictures of a secret love affair he was having!  LOL  The whole thing with holding the family hostage was not convincing.I wanted to like this series, but after viewing the first episode, I really don't want to give it my money.

"I have noticed reviews that shine a negative light on this film get slammed because it is a posthumously released script work of Shelly's, but honestly the execution of her story falls flat.Meg Ryan plays the psycho wife who duct tapes her philandering husband, played by Hutton, to a toilet in hopes of him re discovering his love for her. Kristen Bell plays the easy to believe other woman and Justin Long plays the bad guy that provides the needed fear for everyone to learn about themselves. The Blu quality is poor to below average throughout, with grain, artifact, film degradation and bad line definition. The colors look decent though. The DTS is mostly unused, only getting around while Long is busting up the house. The performances are fine but this is nothing I would want to re watch or say is a must see. The supplements include:* Making of, 12:21 minutes, in lodef. Very dry containing all interviews talking about the 2 week shoot and wanting to get Shelly's work to screen. I liked the commentary better.* HDNet ad plug, 4:40 minutes. Usual long trailer.* Commentary with Cheryl Hines, Ostroy (Shelly's husband) and one other producer. The commentary strains at times to be tolerable, but there are some vital pieces of material there for those creating the nagging arguments about the ending and entire premise of the film. Nice tidbit about Hutton being injured by one of those plants thrown at his head. For those that have been speculating 50 different ways about what the ending means   just turn on the commentary when Ryan is dragged into the bathroom by Long, or for the last few minutes of the film and all will be enlightened.They are very proud of their work and short shoot, and understandably so. English language, subtitled in English and Spanish, no region coding listed. Rental recommendation maybe, but not a valid Blu.

"PLOT SPOILER ALERT!I don't get the 4 and 5 star reviews.  Is this depressing film an apocalyptic fable, or a cautionary tale, or ""when the world comes to an end, you still have each other and your love""?  Perhaps the first two, definitely not the last ""love"" scenario. As far as leaving the theater and being filled with life, someone spiked your Pepsi.If the director & writer were intending to do a somewhat realistic film, and not a fantasy, then they failed.  They have given us a virus that first knocks out your sense of smell, then taste, then hearing, then sight, and finally (not shown in the film) your sense of touch.  ""Love"" as an outward display of affection, is non existent in a world where you cannot smell, taste, hear, see, or touch the one you love.  It is not the ""Perfect Sense"", it is not even a sense.  What is left is a feeling emotion called ""love"" that was derived from the senses, and absent the five senses becomes a memory.The logical conclusion of this movie is that the human population becomes extinct.  Each person dies because of starvation or suicide, alone    probably in fear.  After that, there is not even the memory of ""love"" on this planet.  The only way our two protagonists could have ended this tragic movie with ""love"", was if    while they still had their sense of touch    they took cyanide and hugged and kissed good bye.I gave this film 3 stars because Ava Green is worth watching in any film.

So why 3 stars, you ask? Because first it got me really confused when they showed am extinct species and then they shot them. '' Hey it's the last animal of these species on Earth.  Ah, let's just kill it.'' I really was buffled, because I couldn't tell whether it was a real animal (main animal of the movie) or not. I don't care what they say in titles, I bet it isn't always true. But that is one. I am against killing animals in any shapes or forms with any kind of behavior or level of danger. That is two. And finally, what good of an ending does it have? It doesn't have a good ending! What does this ending mean? That a man judged an animal and how it lived and on that judgement thought it was better off dead. Well thank you very much, but a positive ending would do much better not just to a movie itself but also to people who watch it. Let's face it, some people learn more from the movies. So why not? Is it easier to believe in bad things happening in the end because they seem more real? Is it so hard to believe in good things? This is precisely why humanity is so brewed up in general! The movie did nothing to change things it just showed all the dark poop our ancestors got us into. I bet these animals were amazing. If any of these species would still exist I would take part in helping them, but thanks to the movie it just motivated more people into killing them.

"John Moon (Sam Rockwell) is a bad poacher, having been caught three times. He can keep a job, in fact he has kept many of them. He is also not the most careful hunter as he irresponsibly and accidentally shoots a woman (Lana Giacose). As any good citizen, he robs her and hides the body.  In fact she has a whole box full of money. Our protagonist is not the nicest person in the world.A couple other things that John is not good at are relationships and hiding money. His wife (Kelly Reilly) wants a divorce as John consults the town's most inexpensive attorney (William Macy) whose judgement in suits and hair pieces leads one to believe he doesn't know how to use a mirror. As it turns out the dead girl had a boyfriend (Ted Levine) who knows John has his money and he wants it back.It is difficult to hide things in a small town as the plot develops some minor complexity. The good, the bad, and the ugly of this film is the fact that it captures the rural flavor of the community with local euphemisms, accents, and slow motion talking. Depending on one's viewpoint, this can make or break the movie. John Moon, is well meaning when it comes to his family, but he is not all good and far from the brightest bulb in the pack.A redneck art film. Not for everyone.Parental Guide: F bomb, sex, nudity (Amy Sloan).","SMALL TOWN, MANY INTERESTS",1395273600,"03 20, 2014"

"The next stage of human evolution has begun. All over the world, individuals are developing the powers of telepathy, telekinesis and teleportation. A secret government funded agency, Ultra, is tasked with keeping these individuals under control or removing their powers altogether. However, a small group of 'Tomorrow People' has taken refuge under the streets of New York and is preparing for the day when they can escape persecution.The Tomorrow People is an SF franchise with some history behind it. It originally aired from 1973 to 1979 as a zero budget children's programme in the UK. Although almost forgotten today, it remains the second longest running British SF show of all time in terms of episode count (just beating out Red Dwarf). The series was then revived in 1992 for a three season run. The premise of both shows was that humanity is developing into another form of life   homo superior   and that the new 'break outs' (humans who have developed these powers) need to be helped by the existing Tomorrow People to deal with their newfound abilities. Both shows also used more overtly SF elements like aliens and robots, with the Tomorrow People using an alien spacecraft as their headquarters and relying on a powerful AI named TIM to help them.This latest reboot is from the American CW network and is surprisingly faithful to the original show. Character names are reused, original lead actor Nicholas Young has a cameo and even TIM (now a human built computer) returns. However, the premise is complicated, darkened and made a bit less hokey. There are no aliens or spaceships and the struggle is now presented as being between the Tomorrow People and those humans aware of their existence and who see them as a threat, not a symbol of hope. There are also internal struggles within the Tomorrow People, between those who seek to use their powers for good, those who just want to get on with their lives and others who actively want to use their powers to commit crimes.Our main POV character is Stephen Jameson (Robbie Amell), who breaks out in the first episode and finds himself torn between joining Ultra (run by his uncle Jedikiah, played by genre favourite Mark Pellegrino) and a group of rebels led by John (Luke Mitchell) and Cara (Peyton List). Relations are complicated by John and Cara's group having been founded years earlier by Stephen's missing father Roger (Jeffrey Pierce). Early episodes play up a cheesy love triangle between Stephen, John and Cara and rely on break out of the week plots in which Stephen, having joined Ultra to spy on it for the rebels, has to maintain his cover whilst also helping his friends. Some episodes show promise   Cara's back story is surprisingly well handled, with List playing the younger, more rebellious version of the character with more aplomb than the somewhat dull modern equivalent   but it's pretty disposable stuff.The show shifts up a gear in the mid season, when more people find out about Stephen's powers and the real main antagonist, the Founder (played with scene destroying relish by ex Spartacus actor Simon Merrells) shows up to complicate things. The ongoing story arc comes more to the fore and for a few episodes the show almost lives up to its potential. Particularly welcome is Luke Mitchell stepping up to the plate and impressing more in the role of John. The showrunners seem to be aware of this, with a move in the mid season away from focusing on Stephen as the protagonist (despite bringing enthusiasm to the role, Amell's range is rather limited) and instead on the group as a whole. This works well until the last couple of episodes when the plot starts lurching in all kinds of random directions and the conclusion to the season long arc ends up being a bit of a damp squib. The cliffhanger pulls it back a little by providing some interesting groundwork for the next season, but given there isn't going to be one (the show was cancelled after filming concluded) that doesn't really help.The Tomorrow People (***) is watchable, cheesy and disposable fun which occasionally delivers some above average performances and episodes. There's certainly a lot of mileage in the premise and it's a shame that the show won't be given a chance to improve with time and more episodes. However, the show is also predictable, frequently badly written and some of the actors should really think about taking up other careers: Jeffrey Piece is particularly awful, over acting to the hilt and making even his cornier young co stars look amazing in comparison. Overall, the series is only worth a watch once you have exhausted the several dozen better series around at the moment.","Cheesy, disposable fun",1403395200,"06 22, 2014"
"Coming at this with a disadvantage having never read any of the Bosch books; but, with all that is good about this show, I am not satisfied.  I hate the wrongful death trial and the smarmy plaintiff's lawyer; it is an impediment to an otherwise intriguing, excellently acted story and well developed characterizations.  Welliver and Wersching are both great and make watching a complete pleasure.  Establishing that Bosch has a semi sordid, psyche affecting past can be done without dragging out a dreary, trite courtroom &#34;drama.&#34; (Although, Abraham Benrubi as the defense attorney is inspired casting).

"Joe Garner is a nice guy, somebody you wouldn't mind hanging out with because he is, well, a nice guy. The hanging out wouldn't be wild crazy fun, just a nice good time. Craigslist Joe is a nice film, something reasonably nice to watch, nicely filmed, nicely edited, nicely done. Joe appears to be a kind non judgmental person.At its core, Craigslist Joe is a road movie. The premise Joe Garner wants to spend 30 days living off Craigslist ads only. He's chosen the holidays, December 1 to December 31. At first I wondered if he would just hang out in LA and develop a life off those connections. Instead, the goal was really to do a lap of the United States. For a while I kept thinking about the problems with what he was doing, looking for the flaw in his goal and how he was going to accomplish things. Like why did he borrow a bike from somebody in LA and then take it with him to his next stop. Why the bike, how would he return it to the kind person, where would he leave it? This is fruitless reasoning in the film; it is much better to just take the ride with Joe.This film violates the road movie convention. There are always at least two people on the road. Where are John Candy and Steve Martin? Where were the Griswolds? What happened to Zack Galifianakis (well he is here, but more on that in a moment), Ed Helms, and Bradley Cooper? Shoot where is Thelma and Louise? No this film is all about Joe, one guy on the road. This is the huge flaw in the film, where it falls flat from a dramatic standpoint. There is no tension or drama built with traveling partners. There isn't much of a story built. At the end of the film, I had this empty feeling.On the one hand I loved this film. Joe is such a nice guy. He sets out on a 60's type journey, hitchhike the modern way, using the Internet. I'm sure Joe has incredible memories of his trip. The people along the way can be fantastic in the moment. Conversations all seem so deep. He did the take a summer off and backpack Europe into an American journey. All such a great concept. I hitchhiked across France and I can see how true his experience rang. I really loved the editing and visual language they used in the film. Given the hours and hours of footage they had to choose from, they did a great job piecing this together. I loved the maps and animations when he moved from one city to another. I also really liked the computer postings at the bottom of the screen, they added to the story. The film is a bit long at an hour and thirty minutes. I did find myself looking at how much time was left fairly often.Joe meets a number of tools during this trip. Because he wants to remain friends with these people, he is never judgmental; he leaves that up to the audience. Number one tool was Mr. Suit and Tie on his first stop. It wasn't a great start for the film. On the other hand, he did meet some amazing, nice, friendly, interesting people. Again, because he doesn't judge (verbally or with editing), the viewer can make up his or her own mind. The premise is also kind of strange. We get to hear a lot of the phone calls and what should be the first conversations. At some point I kept thinking, when did Joe mention that he was making a documentary? It is very difficult to imagine that part of the conversation or what Joe would say.Joe: Can I crash at your place   ride with you   help you volunteer somewhere?Person on the phone: Oh maybe.Joe: That's great, I'm making a documentary about using Craigslist to freeload my way around the country. We'd film you and your place.I can imagine the answer going either way. But in the end, it isn't the same thing as just asking somebody if you can help, crash, or ride. There's extra baggage. Joe needed to embrace that and break the fourth wall. He certainly breaks it with his direct confessions into the camera talking to us the viewer.One of the last meetings is really bad. It falls way flat and just sounds stupid in the film. Mentioning the person would be a bad spoiler.There was something that felt wrong about this movie. It was almost too slick, too well produced. I couldn't figure out what was wrong until I read the credits. Zach Galifianakis was the producer of this film. It isn't clear he was involved before or after the 30 days on the road, but his influence is abundantly clear in the film. This film was not somebody outside of the Hollywood machine (Garner was a producer on Hangover II prior to this film), but a person that does have Hollywood experience. Documentaries tend to be made by people on the margin or outside of Hollywood. The editing of this film was particularly good; most documentaries are more hacked together. Drew Kilcoin was the editor   he has some decent movies under his belt (granted as first jazzistant editor), Flight, Beginners, and Texas Chainsaw 3D. Joe Garner managed to find some pretty talented people to help with his film post filming.A good resume is not usually a bad thing, except it takes a lot of shine off something that is a personal project with a simple premise. The production of the film removed it from that simple world.On the other hand, Kevin Flint, the cinematographer is a genius. He did an incredible job on this film. His camera work is excellent under the horrible conditions he had to work in. I would guess the film was all shot handheld, and he did a really good job. Kevin does not appear to be part of the Hollywood machine. It would be interesting to see a little bit of how Kevin kept up on the trip.A bit of parental advice on the audience for this film. The film is not rated. There are a few moments of strong language. There is no nudity, violence, or bloodshed. There are a number of scenes in bars and alcohol use. In theory this could be a PG film. Joe managed to completely avoid the sexual side of this trip. It is kind of hard to imagine nothing happened for a month that he never hooked up with anybody on the road, male or female. He pushes the PG envelope a lot during a visit with a dominatrix in Chicago. There is never any nudity, but the discussion is frank. Oddly Joe is completely asexual. The film is probably best left for a more mature audience.Overall this is not a bad film. It isn't exactly one of the best documentaries around. I dislike the gloss that was added to the film and I am automatically cynical about the Hollywood connection to this film. I think documentary should be independent film, done outside of that industry. I wish there was more of a story and there was a second person on this road trip. On the other hand, Joe is such a nice guy.",A Nice Guy Does A Lap Of The US WIth Craigslist,1372550400,"06 30, 2013"

"I am a HUGE fan of Gilmore Girls.  I own the entire series set on DVD.  I know almost ever line to every episode.  I am a GG Addict.  That being said, after a long hiatus and going through withdrawals from having no Amy Sherman Palladino quick banter to fill my day   she announced that she was bringing Bunheads to a TV near you!At first I was skeptical.  Some of the lines were old GG lines....a great deal of the actors were old cast members of Gilmore Girls   Kelly Bishop, Sean Gunn, Rose Abodo, Alex Borestein, Chris Eigman, Liza Weil, Biff Yeager, Greg Henry, Jon Polito, Todd Lowe   just to name a few.  The banter was quick and witty   ASP hasn't lost her style for sure...So I watched the pilot and needless to say, I was not terribly impressed.  The lines were not believable coming from these sheltered girls living in Paradise CA.  There was no older mentor to give them one liners from &#34;This Is Spinal Tap&#34; and their references to pop culture were not something that this generation (depicted in Bunheads) neither cares for or knows much about (Sad).If you can look past the awkwardness of the first few episodes, the stories get better, the characters find themselves, and the girls become more believable and comfortable in their roles.  Poor Hubble gets squashed in the background as a sideline character who was nothing more than a catalyst for bringing these characters together....What I do love about this show   and it took me a GOOD while to like her   is Sutton Foster.  What a talent!!! And once I got over her not being Lorelai Gilmore, and Not being Lauren Graham, and that she was her own character in itself....I really grew to love her.  She has a good feel for her character Michelle Simms, and she plays her well.Overall, the program is GREAT.  The writing is as smart as always, the jokes are funny, the storyline has a point and the kids are just all around good kids.  The life situations are relatable, and once again, ASP has created a world in which you want to live.....After watching Bunheads, you may want to leave the comfort of Stars Hollow and venture across the country to breathe in the Sea Air in Paradise Ca....Glad to see Amy Sherman Palladino back in the game!!

"The buzz around this film means that it is a must see for any serious `world cinema' fan, so I finally got to see it. I was not expecting too much, but was really impressed by this little gem from Norway. It is a dark fantasy told as a mockumentary from `found tapes. It tells of a group of students from Volda College, who have heard about an illegal bear hunter. They decide as part of their project that they will interview him and maybe even get some action shots.They track down Hans (played brilliantly by Norwegian comedian Otto Jespersen) who is less than willing to talk to him. He drives a customised Land Rover that is so beaten up it would get a Vehicle Rectification Notice if my local Constabulary saw it on the road. So the plucky youngsters decide that they will follow him when he goes out at night. What they run into is given away by the title of the film and Hans decides to let them film him and the Fairy Tale Troll hunts as he is sick of the job.What happens along the way is a story of how the group survive whilst tracking down rogue trolls. So is it any good? Well I absolutely loved it, it is done in chronological order as the tapes were found and is supposed to be a `rough cut', so it can jump around, but it adds to the authenticity of the thing that there are so many cuts. Obvious comparisons to `The Blair Witch Project' are fine, but this is way better than that. The special effects are good to amazing and the folklore around trolls is brilliant, we even get all the science as to why they either blow up or turn to stone when exposed to sunlight, and the whole blood of a Christian thing is thrown into the mix too. Add to that the over enthusiastic teen agers, a government conspiracy, some dodgy Polish Painters (Bear killers) and you have a whole smorgasbord of fun and action.Director Andr&eacute; vredal has done a brilliant job of getting the most from a relatively unknown cast, and has made a truly original film, So original in fact that Hollywood have already snapped up the remake rights, so see the original first. It is in Norwegian with great sub titles but also has an English dub alternative.

"""night train"" seems to begin as a bit of escapist fluff with some lovely shots of lisbon; but the story deepens with gentle sincerity and approaches insights on life that older viewers will fully appreciate.irons is a mature and dreary lyc&eacute;e professor in dreary berne who deters a woman from suicide and then impulsively uses the train ticket he finds in her abandoned coat to track down the author of a book of meditations he also finds in the coat pocket. (quite an impactful coat, so of course it's red.) in lisbon his search leads him to antiquated portuguese resistance fighters who retell in the amber light of declining life their gallant and love tossed lives as young people fighting fascism. this motivates a sextet of cameos by notable 20th century british and german movie stars, all perfect in their roles. their reminiscences are portrayed in flashback by a fine group of young actors.these stories and the literary musings of the philosopher's book fire the professor's imagination and appetite for life; he gets new gljazzes and new clothes, he drinks, he smokes, he sleuths and vagabonds freely, and pretty soon a pjazzably attractive optometrist in a mercedes SUV (quite a snappy SUV, so of course it's red), is pitching him woo, lisbon style. (""why go back to berne? why not stay here!"")i won't apologize for spoilers because everything unfolds as if you have already heard it all; and besides, all the plot twists are in the flashbacks, which reveal the choices and suffering that have made the old people what they are. the beauty of this fantasy is that it shows how one's life is both inevitable and accidental, when viewed in retrospect, which is something old age understands with clarity. the film manages to recreate this delicate contemplative recognition without ever becoming maudlin or trite. completely charming and well done.","youth remembered, and relived",1391472000,"02 4, 2014"
"I think the first season was better. The crimes mysteries were more common place in that you see people lie all the time for the crimes depicted in season 1.  In season 2, the storyline gets more grittier, more dangerous for Dr. Lightman and his team as they confront liars who will do anything to cover up their lies. There's a hint of unrealism in season 2, only because civilians like LIghtman and his team hardly ever get called to go confront people in dangerous places such as Afghanistan or the site of a collapsed mine shaft where anything could blow up at any second. Psychologists like him and his team still realistically work under controlled conditions, either in their office or through videos and one on one interviews.

"I'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller ""Rites of Spring."" As a low budget shocker, it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers. But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story. If not always successful, it was something that I'd never really seen before. So I'll give writer director Padraig Reynolds points for originality. ""Rites of Spring"" is really two different films. One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story. Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own, but it's the mash up that keeps things interesting. My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars. My heart, however, is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers. And I like that! I didn't love ""Rites of Spring"" and probably wouldn't view it a second time, but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide!The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community. Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation. The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice. But for what? And is there any chance of escape? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom. Of course, not all goes as planned. There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group. Before the evening is through, they'll have to determine just who is playing whom. But wouldn't you know it? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up. So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror. As the body count escalates, it becomes a battle for survival. Will anyone endure until dawn?My biggest complaint about ""Rites of Spring"" has to do with a lack of genuine plot development. Nothing really makes much sense in the telling. Neither story, as written and presented, would be satisfying on its own and that's a near fatal misstep. The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme. Meanwhile, the horror story gets the vaguest (and most over used) of explanations. Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios, but each one feels a bit lazy (especially if taken alone). Trust me, aside from the mash up angle, you've seen it all before and you've seen it better. At a brief 81 minutes, however, it is just nutty enough to hold your attention. About 2 1 2 stars. As I said, I'd have been happy enough watching this for free, but it's not something that I'd recommend as a blind purchase.

"I read a lot of comics as a boy including all about SHIELD.  This show about SHILD is bad on many labels.  First off I would like to mention the racist stuff.  The first episode we have a African American dude who gets some super powers and unlike many marvel people who get powers (Peter Parker, Dr. Strange etc.) he deciders to be a criminal.  So the black guy becomes a criminal, SHIELD catches him and later in the show he wants to be an agent and in one episode with him he is told that his strength scores are not even close to ""Captain America's"" even though he did something far more amazing than Captiain America has ever done on screen and then later in the show he is burned alive and then made a slave.Also lets talk about the asian lady (Melinda May) who is actually expressionless.  Remember all the asian stereotypes of asian people in comics where they were said to be alien and expressionless where here you go.  The stereotype in the flesh and boring as ever.Next lets go to the hot hacker lady that does not act, speak or even look like a hacker or even a stereotyped hacker.  This woman looks like a college student who shops at Bloomingdales.  She never talks about commuters and used no hacker references in her speech.  Most miscast person on the show.Then there is our white knight Brett who brings no conflict or drama to the show in any way and if his character would die I would never know or care.The scientist are actually great.  Elizabeth is hot is a geeky way and actually acts like a science nerd.  Brett does the same and personally if they unsolved J August Richards I would be thrilled for a show just about these three characters.The leader of the gang is Phil Coulson played by Clark Gregg from the avengers movie. I like him as a character but in no way do I think he could make it as a SHIELD agent.  He holds a gun way to timidly unlike Sam Jackson or even boring Melinda or Brett.Then the Captain America movie happens and strangely everything changes.  The actors get a huge crazy complicated plot and way better lines.  Everything gets way way better.  So much better that I will not spoil anything.  So I do think the early episodes are slow and lacking and good to listen to if you are doing house work but when the Cap America Movie Winter Soldier movie happens drop what you are doing and grab the popcorn!","Pre Cap movie is boring, racist and slow, post cap movie is amazing!",1395100800,"03 18, 2014"
"If you read any of my reviews, you know I'm not going to tell you any spoilers. So, here's my take on this film: It's more of a mental issues mixed with a desperate situation. By the time you get to the middle of the movie, you will feel for the son and what he has and is going through. It has a touch of male bonding too, which lends to the storyline nicely. It is not a full on horror movie in the sense of slicing and dicing, it's more like mental horror. Great flick! Worth a watch.","Low budget, but well directed.",1366675200,"04 23, 2013"
"The narrative captures the creative essence which, upon viewing, can accurately be said to have fueled the entire music boom from the early '60's to the '80's. Name an artist. Elton John, Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart, Allman Brothers, Lynrd Skynrd, Bobbie Jo Gentry, Aretha Franklin, Paul Simon, Wilson Pickett.. the list extends very far. They all recorded at Muscle Shoals and took advantage of the dedicated, craft oriented session players, many of whom were white, middle cljazz boys out of high school, to play on their records. Yet their sound intimated an ethnic orientation beyond the color of their skin. The main figure, Rick Hall, calls it the &#34;human element,&#34; a relentless dedication to perfection. An unswerving dedication to craft. It shows through in this movie. American draftsmanship.",You can tell when the music is real,1400371200,"05 18, 2014"
"**1 2So what do we have here? Nothing but another unnecessary remake of an &#8216;80s film. This time it&#8217;s &#8220;About Last Night,&#8221; the romantic drama starring Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, which was itself based on the highly acclaimed play by David Mamet, provocatively entitled &#8220;Sexual Perversity in Chicago.&#8221; In this version, it&#8217;s Joy Brand and Michael Ealy who play the young urban couple who meet, fall in love, move in together, then begin to have doubts about the efficacy and durability of their relationship.Brand and Ealy are appealing and attractive performers, and both have done fine work on TV, Brand in &#8220;Parenthood&#8221; and Ealy in &#8220;Almost Human.&#8221; But here they have been let down by screenwriter Leslye Headland, who proves herself incapable of getting past all the timeworn tropes and cliches that have become so much a part of the romantic comedy genre. The movie becomes just another men are from Mars women are from Venus type scenario, filled with girl talk and guy talk and all the predictable sturm und drang soul baring and commitment issues (mainly on the part of the man, of course) that such narratives are prone to. Too often the things pulling the couple apart feel scripted and manufactured rather than organic and real. Under the slick but lackluster direction of Steve Pink, everyone just seems to be going through the motions, without any real pjazzion or conviction.The movie also comes replete with the requisite smart aleck, comic relief couple (well played by Kevin Hart and Regina Hall) to serve as a foil for the one on center stage. Yet, even the humor tends to aim low when it should be aiming high.I like the way the story hits the re set button in the final scene, but by then it&#8217;s a case of too little too late and we&#8217;ve already moved onto the next movie.",A step down for this popular property,1402185600,"06 8, 2014"

"I can understand the necessity of some divergence from the book and characters, and I even understand the rationale for some of the specific changes they made, but there's a serious disconnect between the two. That's OK, because the book was even worse. But even though a lot happens in each episode, yet it seems like little forward motion in the story. It drags. And worst of all, the acting is truly awful in nearly all cases. Many good series with good writing, good stories, good actors get cancelled. They're going to renew this for a second season?

"I've been an ardent fan of the show from the beginning, of the extraordinary cast in particular (they get 5 Stars!)  in seasons one and two I waited each week with baited breath for the next episode. But even though I want to see what happens next, and I'm watching season three, some things have troubled me about the show from the start. I've thought about it quite a bit, and though I'm not sure how well I can express it, I'll try. [NOTE: There's an update at the end of my review.]I read recently that the director Sidney Lumet said ""In a well written drama, the story comes out of the characters. The characters in a well written melodrama come out of the story."" Though I'm still puzzling over what this means, exactly, by that definition I'd say Once Upon a Time is a melodrama, in that it is plot driven, rather than character driven. I think in the best works, in any genre, a great story zigzags back and forth between drama and melodrama, i.e., between plot and character development, each seamlessly informing and enriching the other. ONCE is woefully inadequate in the character development department. The characters are one dimensional. These fantastic actors (and we fans) deserve so much more.Before you say ""They're fairy tale characters, for goodness sake, what do you expect?"" I expect good drama  character development to rival, complement mythic themes. In thinking about the show, it finally dawned on me that the character neglect reminds me of the cognitive deficits in certain syndromes. In autism, for example, especially Asperger's Syndrome, one thing that characterizes many patients is a preoccupation with the trees to the exclusion of the forest. Such patients focus for hours on separate parts, on the mechanics of things. An analogy might be someone intent on cataloging the stars in the sky, one after another, but being unable to appreciate the majesty of the cosmos, feel a sense of awe and wonder when appraising the night sky in its entirety.Similarly, in Oliver Sacks's wonderful book THE MAN WHO MISTOOK HIS WIFE FOR A HAT, he describes the behavior and bizarre ""reality"" of patients who've suffered right hemisphere brain damage. What remains is the left hemisphere, and the way it processes info is by parts and feature analysis. Lacking the right brain, which puts everything together, sees relations, wholes, and attaches feelings and significance to perceptions and events, the left brain focuses on sequential details, linear analysis, which results in a very odd and unsatisfying experience for those affected, sadly. Indeed, patients with Asperger's and RH damage tend to have great difficulties with personal relationships, their perceptual blinders rendering them unable to apprehend other people in all their complexity. People who love them often find interactions extremely frustrating.ONCE reminds me of that brand of reality, a focus on the machinations of the plot, with scant appreciation of the depth, profundity and emotional complexity of human beings, both individually and in concert with each other. The characters' major function is to drive the plot forward, it's the plot itself that take precedence, like a big math problem (albeit at times an intriguing one).The antithesis of this, for me, might be the pithy, splendid TV Series THE CROW, STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN or the movie FAIRY TALE: A TRUE STORY. They succeed as both superb melodrama and superb drama, emotionally affecting, weaving intricate plot lines and characters into tapestries that become far more than the sum of their parts.And another observation, at the risk of sounding sexist  I can't help but wonder if the fact that all the writers on the show are male doesn't contribute to this preoccupation with mechanics and linear details (research has shown that left brain processes tend to predominate in males, whereas females tend to use both hemispheres in tandem). Seriously, if I didn't know better I'd swear the show was written by a bunch of 14 year old boys with high level Asperger's Syndrome (some Asperger's folks have high IQs, see the world in simplistic, black and white terms, but construct super elaborate scenarios around simplified themes from which they're loathe to deviate).[Update: I stand corrected  as others kindly pointed out, they've corrected that situation and have hired female writers, I'm happy to learn.] Fairy tales have traditionally been the province of girls, much more so than boys. Granted, most fairy tales were recorded & or collected by men, but I've always pictured them being offered as gifts, infused with hopes and dreams, by mothers down through the ages, told as bedtime stories, a feminine oral tradition fueling their children's  especially their daughters'  imaginations. I DO applaud the writers for depicting strong, heroic women, kudos for that. All I know is that what l most love about fairy tales...isn't here, it's missing.Were I the head writer on the show, I'd ensure that the writers focus less on the dizzying intricacies and pyrotechnics of the plot (could it BE more pointlessly complicated??), and slow down a bit, putting flesh on characters' bones and exploring relationships between them. Can you do that without sacrificing clever plot twists, and while still showing what's happening with multiple characters? Sure, ST. ELSEWHERE, for example, did it spectacularly well (the best TV show ever, I think)  and the hit show BORGEN too, from Denmark. And actually, come to think of it, another offering starring Ginnifer Goodwin, HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU, also succeeded in that respect (at least I think so, not everyone liked it as much as I). In a review of it it was noted that even a brief scene in which Bradley Cooper declined Ben Affleck's offer of a cigarette bespoke volumes about the characters (while also advancing the plot), no wasted moments. Anyway, the marvelous actors on ONCE deserve such character development and subtlety, that's what I'm waiting for, yearning for, anyway...Then again, when I'm feeling a little less magnanimous, I wonder if maybe the writers and producers don't know EXACTLY what they're doing. Now and then there's this nagging feeling that somehow I'm being made a fool of, that maybe someone's having a good laugh at my expense. Why would ANYONE stick around, year after year, given so few crumbs, on a mere promise of something that never seems to materialize? Where's the payoff for my attentiveness, my loyalty? Perhaps some suit said: ""Mix up the metaphors! Throw in everything but the kitchen sink, THAT'LL keep 'em guessing. Hell, we can even call it a new GENRE!"" Or: ""Just toss around a few buzzwords, you know, true love, true hearts, true WHATEVER...human imagination being what it is, they'll supply their OWN profundity. HEY! How about SAVIOR  it's LOADED with jazzociations, throw THAT in!"" Could there be a standing bet as to how long the show can be drawn out, how much profit can be amjazzed, how much convoluted but simplistic DRIVEL can be heaped on hapless fans before they begin to get wise? You know the old saying, you can fool some of the people... I haven't given up on ONCE yet, but I'm getting awfully close.UPDATE: The show continued in much the same vein, until Episode 4, Quite a Common Fairy  smashing, brilliant, exactly the kind of stories, with the interpersonal punch, I've longed for. If the show continues with this kind of writing I'll be one happy fan.

"""The Mutant Chronicles"" plays like a bad SyFy movie original film. In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist. When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that ""creates"" mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill, these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet.

The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie wouldn't matter if it were inspired unfortunately ""The Mutant Chronicles"" written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter, the script and direction are amateurish at best. While the cast is fairly solid it's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money (as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets). It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script, direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even jazzembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950's style of filmmaking.

I'm not sure if this was all Bradys idea & the wives are forced to go along with it (which seems the case with most things) or if they all just really were hoping that TLC would pay for some huge mansions like the Browns got (hence the push to move somewhere else from the first episode)?ALL of the wives seem so afraid to ""make waves"" that they are very obviously repressing almost all emotion especially in the presence of each other & their ""master"". Paulie looks like its affecting her the worst, the only time she really had a REAL smile seemed to be when they were drinking, the rest of the time when she does rarely smile they just seemed forced and sad.

What an egotistical jerk! He cant even begin to open his eyes to see how much all of these women he says he ""loves"" are SUFFERING! Wake up dirt bag, while your talking about how ""beautiful"" everything is, they are talking about how hard it really is, their obviously painful jealousy, and trying desperately to get your attention ANY way they can think of it (adoption, pregnancy, weight issues, empty nest, holiday party, etc). For someone with so many women in his life, he doesn't seem to get them or want to understand them at all, or maybe he just doesn't want to face the fact that he is the single biggest source of pain in all of these womens hearts (oh sorry I mean ache, blah). Watching him time after time put the needs of his wives last & joking about things that make them all so uncomfortable is just horrible.Like the show is so aptly named ""MY five wives"", meaning its all about HIM and living his fantasy dream life. Why does HE get to be the one who decides if and where they will all move?! He acts like its a vote, but you can tell its not, like most everything else, its whatever will make HIM happiest. Why do a couple wives get to have the amount of children they want but the others have to beg and cry for their fair share? Were those other wives better ""behaved"" so they got what they wanted? Why does one get to adopt while another has to beg for a baby of her own? Why does one wife get called ""beautiful"" every day but the others have to beg for complements (especially the poor absolutely gorgeous full figured one)? If each of the adults have to cook dinner one day a week, why doesn't HE?! And how horrible of him to show up in the MIDDLE of his kids karate event (and the wife & child both seem soooo greatful for that 15min)what kind of father is that?! And why on earth are they all called ""aunt so & so"" to the children, they aren't aunts, they are MOTHERS of all of your children and should be given the name & respect that comes with it! Why is chatting it up with the guys at work so much more important than even remembering to show up to meet your wife for something YOU asked her to do for you?! How dare you take that woman for granted! Get a darn organizer or planner if its that hard for you to remember everything!I feel so sorry for the kids brought up in this environment, no wonder so many of them want to leave and cant wait to go live a normal life. Why would they want to live polygamy after growing up watching their moms suffer like this?! This show is just painful to watch. Yes, the Browns have their issues too but they don't seem afraid to confront them head on & together without obvious scripting. And yes Kody is an egotistical douche bag too, but at least he really does seem to TRY to be a better husband and father and at least he hasn't completely broken the spirit of 5 beautiful women. I will continue to watch only because I will be hoping with every fiber of my being that these women start to stand up for themselves & stop being such depressing lap dogs!

"It's totally my fault for not watching the trailer for THE BAY before renting this film, but I had no idea the entire thing would be a collection of poorly filmed video clips, interviews, and shaky cam shots of people running about and screaming.  That's about it.  There is no plot and there are no characters.OK, there are a few characters.  Kristen Connolly (""Cabin in the Woods"") plays a reporter who is making a documentary about a disastrous plague that infected a small coastal town in Maryland.  It's her voice you hear doing voiceovers, and she's the one pulling all the different film clips together from material confiscated by the government.  Frank Deal plays Mayor John Stockman, who was told about the toxicity in the bay but refused to do anything (he's pretty much a retread of the mayor in JAWS who wouldn't close the beaches because he was worried about the tourist trade).  Then there are a bunch of characters called ""Victim #1,"" ""Fair Man,"" ""Activist,"" ""Middle Aged Supporter,"" and ""Bob.""  I don't remember any of them individually.  But who cares?The plot can be summed up as follows:  The water in the bay is toxic because the mayor allowed chicken processing companies to dump their waste into it, which created mutant parasites, which infected the fish, which infected the people, who are now all developing grotesque blisters and lesions and generally going berserk.  We see a couple of so called ""research scientists"" doing ridiculous experiments like looking inside a fish's mouth with a flashlight (aha! Parasites in there!).  Doctors speak like high school students.  People run around bleeding and screaming and throwing up.  And Kristen Connolly tries to be all serious as she comments on all this like it's really, really happening.THE BAY is a low budget parody of CONTAGION (which also suffered from too little characterization).  I have no clue why critics gave this film positive reviews   I guess they enjoyed the ""found footage"" technique far more than I did (if I never see a ""found footage"" film again, it will be too soon!).

"Few years back, when Colony Season 2 first came out, I watched it and HATED it,, However, I had the chance to watch it again, and I came away far more impressed the second time.  What changed?  My personal perspective on the show, and how the producers tried to respond to legitimate criticism to Season 1.  Please allow me to explain:*Ssn 1 was criticized because it had far too many resources, gadgets and supplies available to them.  Quite simply, Ssn 1 was unrealistic in that regard.  Ssn 2, however, went too far the other way:  the Colonists had almost nothing to work with, planted as they were in a Katrina destroyed and very clearly picked over area.  .* Second, Ssn 1 had TOO LARGE A CAST, most of whom thus had far too little to do...that was filled with TOO MANY Type A personalities, which created mjazzive ego driven personality clashes  that were no doubt also stoked by the show's producers, in pursuit of ratings.  Season 2 solved this by casting ZERO Type A personalities  as one Ssn 2 cast member said in about Episode 3, &#34;We're all Indians and no Chiefs.&#34;  It was indeed painful to see Ssn 2 go many weeks with no natural leader emerge...indeed, several of the colonists appeared hostile to even the idea of a leader, and simply wanted to &#34;self govern.&#34;  Not surprisingly, a lot of &#34;self governing&#34; looked a lot like &#34;laziness.&#34;  With no one to organize focused efforts, the show languished, kind of wandering through a leaderless vacuum.  Ultimately, the show had to force an election for a leader and, not surprisingly, the colonists' productivity ramped up significantly once this was done..  I now realize this was a problem driven entirely by casting production decisions.  Understanding this flaw, I watched Ssn 2 in a different light, and got much more out of it, as a result.* Similarly, Ssn 2 cast was smaller, and these colonists per capita had far fewer useful skills for a post apocalyptic world.  In that regard, Ssn 2 was probably far more realistic than Ssn 1, which had a statistically impossible group of skilled individuals.  Again, however, the producers over corrected; thus a &#34;model&#34; with no discernible skills other than her looks and (occasional) berry picking emerged as one of the power players in the group.  Very unrealistic, and at times reminiscent of a Survivor episode, as the model kept wanting to &#34;vote people off the island!&#34;  Oh, not officially, of course...but effectively.* Finally, Ssn 2 also over corrected in the area of security threats to the colonists.  Yes, Ssn 1 was impossibly safe.  OTOH, Ssn 2 had many more security threats...and yet absolutely NO ONE with any reasonable skills to address those security threats.  For example, they desperately needed someone with law enforcement or prior military experience, but simply had no one to fill the bill.  Thus, they drifted through the various security threats, repeatedly getting robbed blind...because they had no one with a clue to deal with security.Once I realized all of these over corrections on the part of The Colony's producers, I was able to watch Ssn 2 with a more reasonable perspective:  the Ssn 2 colonists were set up to fail, whereas the Ssn 1 colonists were set up to succeed AND to drive interpersonal conflicts that rarely seemed reasonable to viewers (they all seemed manufactured by the show).Finally, then...I was able to watch Ssn 2 with fewer expectations...and in that light, I was able to recognize a not atypical group struggling to survive cope in a threatening environment...but lacking the natural skills to do so.  Given that understanding, Ssn 2 becomes far more watchable, and there are even many lessons learned from this group's dynamics and experiences.So, I now can recommend The Colony Season 2...as long as I can explain to folks the differences compared to the first season, and also the differences in the cast.  They are two entirely different shows, and should be watched with two entirely different sets of expectations.Give those provisos...Colony Season 2 is worth watching.  I recommend it.",Seemed Better 2nd Time I watched this season,1389139200,"01 8, 2014"

"Hollow (Michael Axelgaard, 2011)Sometimes, during those brief moments of lucidity when my head clears a little and I can step back from the Netflix Instant queue, I ask myself why it is I continue to watch movies in subgenres that were played out before they even got popular. I never come up with a good answer to the question (and I'm never lucid long enough to go digging, really). Case in point: the found footage film, an offpsring of the mockumentary that is, ultimately, an offshoot of the popularity of 1999's The Blair Witch Project. I've seen maybe a half dozen found footage films I would consider watching a second time; I've seen maybe one hundred found footage films overall. Hollow is not only not one of the half dozen, it's a movie I would consider using as an instrument of torture were I a guard at the Salt Pit. Pointless, plotless, presumably scriptless nonsense that almost dares the viewer to keep watching to see how much worse things are going to get. Guess what? The answer is &#8220;a lot&#8221;.Plot: Two couples are on vacation on the English moors. Okay, maybe not moors. But that sound spookier. It's actually quite dry for England. And maybe not vacation, either; they've come to sort out a dead relative's estate. Dead relative is a priest, and estate is... an old abbey? I think it was an old abbey. While they're on their way there, they pjazz a big old gnarled tree, and Emma (Emily Plumtree in her first feature appearance) relates the story of how the tree is possessed blah blah. Emma, her beau James (The Task's Sam Stockman), and their pals Lynne (Get Him to the Greek's Jessica Ellerby) and Scott (Devil's Pjazz' Matt Stokoe&#8212;no relation to the writer, at least I fervently hope not), arrive at the old pile and spend a few entirely uninteresting days trying to keep a clich&eacute;d script afloat (predictable sexual tension between non couple pieces, growing obsession with the tree, things that go bump in the night) before, of course, they must all go confront the tree and find out if it's really possessed or if the scriptwriters were just ripping off The Blair Witch Project.You get all the usual lowlights from a movie like this, people running around and screaming incoherently, usually off camera, while something that you never quite get to see is chasing them. Now, I am a big, big fan of not revealing the monster; the one scene I didn't like in Cloverfield (and yes, I do realize I am the only person who really liked that movie, shut up about it) is the one Big Reveal scene at the end that's there solely to stop the mjazzes complaining that you never get to see the monster. (Compare with the excellent scene in Val Lewton's Cat People in Central Park, where you get a few glimpses of shadow at best; it is a textbook in how to create suspense.) So when I'm complaining about it, you know you've got problems. Much of the problem has to do with the fact that, during the action scenes, we're not really seeing much of the characters, either; Axelgaard seems to have decided that the movie would be more suspenseful if you couldn't see the characters or the thing chasing them. Not a bad experiment, but he probably should have changed direction once he realized how incredibly stupid it ends up looking. You, too, would be better served by avoiding such.

"I watched the original V series with Marc Singer back in the 80's when I was a kid and really liked it, though having watched it again recently it is pretty hokey and badly done.  The remake (in my opinon) has been a refreshing update revival of the original.  Admittedly, there are a couple of people in the new series who have done a very poor acting job, but most of the cast have carried their own well.One reviewer recently stated how poor the series is compared to many of HBO's original programming.  He is correct!  However, comparing the budget and access to good actors that regular network television has to that of a well funded, highly acclaimed cable network is akin to comparing apples to oranges.  Network television rarely has quality programming anymore.  When put into that context its a bit easier to cut the show some slack   lol!While it is extremely rare to catch me watching network tv, if one is a Sci Fi fan and has so little to choose from (the sy fy *formally Sci Fi* channel is horrible!) then the new V series is as good as it gets.  ;)",3.5 Stars Realistically,1294531200,"01 9, 2011"

"Director Randy Moore filmed Escape from Tomorrow entirely at the Disney World and Disneyland theme parks. As he did not have permission to do so, he used meticulously planned guerrilla tactics in order to shoot the film without being caught. The actors kept the script on their iPhones. The crew used handheld cameras and dressed as park visitors. Scenes were blocked and rehearsed several times in hotel rooms before shooting, and dialogue was recorded using digital devices which were taped to the actors. The film was also shot in monochrome, in order to avoid lighting issues. No one ever suspected the cast or crew of foul play. In this respect, Escape from Tomorrow is an incredibly risky one of a kind achievement. Randy Moore was afraid that Disney would find out about his little experiment, and so he edited the film in South Korea. The film was released at Sundance, and word of mouth spread quickly.Ultimately, the unorthodox history behind the making of the film would prove to be far interesting than the film itself.Escape from Tomorrow tells the story of Jim White, who finds out that he has lost his job on the last day of his family vacation at Disney World. He decides to keep it to himself, so that his wife, his son, and daughter can have a fun time without all of the drama. As he and his family ride the monorail to the park, Jim catches sight of two young Parisian girls &#8211; two little Lolita&#8217;s that he will soon become obsessed with. Make no mistake, Jim is a disturbed man. While riding the &#8220;Small World&#8221; attraction, Jim begins to hallucinate. The cherub faced animatronics begin to grow fangs, smiling evilly at Jim as he pjazzes by. Later, Jim catches sight of the Parisian girls once again, and follows them to Space Mountain, where he forces his son to ride. After the kid gets motion sickness, Jim&#8217;s wife chastises him, and she takes the boy back to the hotel to recover. Jim takes his daughter to the Magic Kingdom, where the son of a creepy wheel chair bound man pushes her to the ground, scraping her knee. Jim takes her to the nurse, who seems to be a bit disturbed and warns Jim of a mysterious &#8220;cat flu&#8221; that is going around the park. &#8220;You can be a host and not even know it,&#8221; she says.For the rest of the day, Jim will continue to follow the Parisian girls, he will fall under the spell of an ex Disney princess who is now an evil queen, and he will learn that the majority of the ever smiling Disney Princesses at the park are actually expensive hookers who sell themselves to rich Japanese businessmen, while also becoming the target of an evil plot at Epcot&#8217;s Spaceship Earth which will purge him of his vivid imagination. Hallucinatory images are sprinkled throughout to give the film a surreal Lynchian feel, but these moments are fleeting &#8211; which is upsetting, because these are perhaps the most involving sequences in the film, as the bulk of the running time is dedicated to Jim&#8217;s tireless pursuit of those darned Parisian girls. These scenes are repetitive and dull &#8211; and honestly, Jim is a poorly written character. After a while, I was ready to get away from him.And then there&#8217;s the &#8220;cat flu&#8221; sequence, which brought back memories of a certain toilet scene from Dumb and Dumber. After a few more slightly trippy scenes, the film ends in a bizarre fashion that doesn&#8217;t quite work, not even in the realm of avant garde cinema. The trailer for Escape from Tomorrow would have you believe that this is one of the greatest films ever made, a psychedelic wonder the likes of which you have never seen before. At the end of the day, all that it really offers is weak social commentary on the inherent creepiness behind family theme parks, featuring the shenanigans of a Lester Burnham wannabe. The one saving grace in Escape from Tomorrow comes in the form of Abel Korzeniowski&#8217;s beautiful score.I wanted to love this film. I really did. While there are some clever moments here, they never really add up to much. I wanted this film to take me to new heights, to restore my faith in the medium. It didn&#8217;t do any of those things.

"One of my favorite random ""30 Rock"" gags of recent vintage is that the show within the show only got on the air as NBC's way of apologizing for having aired ""Bitch Hunter,"" a misogynist action drama starring Will Ferrell as a hero who barks out dialogue like, ""Put the mimosas down, witch!"" Each time we'd see a clip of ""Bitch Hunter,"" it would come with a credit listing the various writers and producers, which included eccentric former NBC president Ben Silverman, ""Mad Men"" creator Matthew Weiner and ""30 Rock"" writer Jack Burditt.At the time, I just took it as a friendly dig at one of the series' own writers. But having watched two episodes of ""Last Man Standing"", the Burditt created sitcom in which Tim Allen plays a sexist, homophobic, xenophobic sporting goods executive, I had the following thoughts:1)Allen's character would probably be right in the ""Bitch Hunter"" target demo;2)""Last Man Standing"" is Burditt participating in an elaborate practical joke to see how much of that ethos he can put into a network sitcom; or3)That ""30 Rock"" kept jazzociating ""Bitch Hunter"" with Burditt was less a friendly joke than a veiled cry for help.Allen's Mike Baxter has a cliched sitcom wife   always rolling her eyes at his foolishness but ultimately going along   named Vanessa, a trio of daughters and a job at Outdoor Man, a sporting goods company defined for so long by Mike's real baby: a catalog featuring photos of outdoor men doing manly outdoor things in exotic locales. But as boss Ed points out, not enough people read catalogs anymore, so Mike's globe trotting lifestyle gets grounded while he tries to fix the company's terrible website   and so he can realize how much his girls need a man around the house.The youngest of them is played by Kaitlyn Dever, who was so incredible last season as the orphaned Loretta on ""Justified."" I know work is work, but it's  disheartening to see her here.Mike's a guy's guy who has no idea what ""Glee"" or the Harry Potter books are, is happy to be at the office because, quote, ""it smells like balls in here,"" and seems convinced that his family in particular and the world in general are going to hell in a hand basket because there aren't enough real men anymore.""Men used to build cities just so we could burn them down!"" he rants during a webcast that unexpectedly turns into a viral sensation. ""You can't even change a tire! A tire! Why don't you get off the couch, you moron, and go outside!?!?""Other jokes involve Mike being uncomfortable about other cultures, gay people and immigrants, among others.Allen played a similar character on ""Home Improvement,"" and while I was never a big fan of that show, I don't remember Tim Taylor ever being this abrasive. I didn't like Tim Taylor, but I didn't instantly hate him the way I do within 90 seconds or so of being with Mike Baxter.And there's humor to be mined from a prejudiced and or reactionary character. See Archie Bunker, most famously, or Stacy Keach on ""Titus,"" or even much of what Burditt and company had Jack Donaghy say and do on ""30 Rock."" But those shows told those jokes with more style, and usually had an awareness of the ludicrous and or offensive nature of those characters' words and deeds. ""Last Man Standing"" doesn't.Allen's a comedy professional, beloved sitcom star and the voice of Buzz Lightyear. These are all things that would lead me to jazzume that the studio audience   a species that tends to be generous with their laughter, anyway, by virtue of being physically present and encouraged by the warm up guy   would enthusiastically respond to all of these groaners. Yet the episodes ABC made so far were clearly done before the laugh track was sweetened   a common industry practice where the studio audience's laughter is augmented with pre recorded laughs from older sitcoms   and you can hear crickets most of the time.""Last Man Standing"" is the first of three new ABC comedies in which men struggle with what it means to be men in a world dominated by women. Each of them   ""Man Up!"" and ""Work It"" are the others   are terrible in their own way, but given the presence of Burditt behind the camera, and Allen in front of it, the cringe inducing badness of this one feels the most frustrating.Unless, again, the whole thing is a very expensive, well disguised prank.",The whole thing feels like a gross miscalculation--a failed attempt to update Allen's familiar persona for an angrier time.,1320019200,"10 31, 2011"

It was worth it for me.However, the 3 stars is due to the abruptness in ending what promised to be a good plot.

"Audiences have shown a benign fascination with films involving torture.  Online critics are quick to jazzociate much of this to the SAW franchise   puzzle pictures all centered around a mysterious puppetmaster who puts his players through increasingly gruesome physical ordeals   but methinks it's probably gone on since legitimate splatter films built an audience throughout the 1970's and early 80's.  One things for certain: if you're no cringing or looking away, then you're possibly drawn into the relentless twists that produce harm, fractures, and bloodflow.  And, if that's your thing, you'd do well to pick up a copy of WOULD YOU RATHER.  It may not end up being more than a pjazzing favorite, but you could do worse with 93 minutes, that's for sure.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Iris (played with curious detachment by Brittany Snow) finds herself desperate to make ends meet when she gives up her college career in order to care back home for her terminally ill brother.  Distraught further to learn that she's no match to his needed blood marrow transplant, she responds to a telephone call from his doctor with a great surprise: a millionaire philanthropist named Shepard Lambrick (Jeffrey Combs) believes he may be able to offer the young woman an opportunity to see all of her prayers answered.  Lambrick asks Iris to join her at his estate for a dinner, where she and others will be appealing to the Lambrick Foundation.  The catch: only one of those in dire need can and will be helped.WOULD YOU RATHER begins much like it sounds, presenting the ultimate `what if' scenario to dinner guests all hoping for jazzistance.  They've all been told previously that, after their meal, they'll be taking part in a game to determine which of them will be the lucky winner, and, on that level, the film tries hard to appeal to even the audience's benevolence: clearly, this ""game"" can't be all that it's been made out to be, and these guests find themselves essentially in a sadist's version of `truth or dare' that more likely resembles `dare or dare.'  One by one, they're offered two choices   harm yourself or harm the person on your left (or right)   and, as much as writer Steffen Schlachtenhaufen and director David Guy Levy would have you believe they've crafted a game of wills, it's hardly that.  Simply put, it can't be a true game of wills when a player is forced to choose between two truly bad choices.The story tries to work toward some depth of individual convictions: where it fails is that we're only truly given Iris's background   in fact, we're shown what her life looks like with flashbacks featuring her and her brother   so the other guests at the table never become more than just other guests at the table.  There are hints to some of the obstacles they're possibly facing, but, as the narrative device gives viewers little chance to understand or identify them, they end up being nothing more than hapless victims slowly draining the life from one another.  Sure, there may be some nice ensemble chemistry, but, without any emotional attachment to these other players, it ends up feeling a bit flat.What does work is Combs' palpable menace.  He commands the screen whenever he's there   having followed his career since the 80's, I've always had some respect for his obvious theatricality.  It's nice to see him getting some material that, despite its weaknesses, truly gives him something to do.  As a character, one could argue he's far more interesting than even Ms. Snow (the obvious lead), but, again, a somewhat hackneyed script never produces much hint of substance as to what's made the nefarious Mr. Lambrick into the nefarious Mr. Lambrick.  Villains without motivation work only in thrillers, but they're soon lost to memory once it all fades to black.Lastly, there's a clever little twist brought up in the film's closing sequences.  From what little I've read (in other critiques), it appears to have generated a modest amount of controversy, some claiming it kinda sorta negates the whole message inherent in what came before it (the twist).  I'd argue that that's far from the case; rather, I see it at instilling yet another lesson to those who ""play"" with life in the way that these fortunate and unfortunate dinner guests did.  It's far too precious to be reduced to a `what if.'  Too bad that's something the screenwriter missed when he conceived of all this.WOULD YOU RATHER (2012) is produced by Periscope Entertainment and Social Construct.  DVD distribution is being handled through MPI Media Group.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid throughout.  As for the special features, there's an audio commentary track featuring the director and writer along with a poster gallery (???) and the theatrical trailer: it's a small collection, but it's there for those inclined to explore the subject matter further.RECOMMENDED.  If I can give you no better reason to see this indie killer thriller, then it would be to watch the incomparable Jeffrey Combs as the undeniably demented Shepard Lambrick.  WOULD YOU RATHER go back and watch him in RE ANIMATOR?  Or what of his spectacularly nuanced work as Weyoun the Vorta on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE?  Or how about his wonderful turn on USA Network's THE 4400?  He's a master of his craft, and, if anything, WOULD YOU RATHER gives him some appropriate scenery to chew as a sadist with a mission: to play a game with the lives of the players truly in the balance.  He's the ultimate `dungeon master' in this contemporary spin on THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME   the ringleader in the most bizarre circus you'll ever see.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of WOULD YOU RATHER by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","A SAW-Inspired Dinner Party, Complete With Desserts!",1373846400,"07 15, 2013"

"What in the world are ""progressive polygamists,"" as the Williamses, the subjects of this series, claim to be? Seems like a contradiction in terms.Polygamy is not a progressive lifestyle by any means, never was and never will be. It's a male centered lifestyle, in which all the women  and, in this case, 24 (!) children  fight for one man's attention. I can understand people practicing polygamy because it's their religious conviction to do so, as the Browns from Sister Wives claim, but the Williamses say they no longer hold true to the doctrines of Fundamental Mormonism, or the FLDS church. So they apparently now choose this lifestyle  or, as I see it, it's too late to change things. So now what?Are they stuck? Must be because what woman in her right mind would choose to share her husband with four other women if it's not something she believes will get her into heaven for time and all eternity? I wonder what this family is teaching the children.That it's OK for a man to have a number of women even though it's not dictated by their religion or condoned by society? (Do these ""progressives"" also believe it's OK for a woman to have multiple husbands?) And what religion do they now practice? Surely, there is no other Christian religion that is OK with polygamy. This family seems a bit of a jumble.A lot of reviewers claim the women, who are all cousins born in polygamous families in the same region of Utah in which the clan currently resides, appear to be depressed, and I would concur. Paulie is lovely, but she rarely cracks a smile and seems to not enjoy being in front of the camera. Rosemary is at least truthful. I like her honesty regarding jealousy and weight issues. Nonie is harsh, but seems bright. Rhonda and Robyn are kind and sweet but they too have that same glazed expression as the others.Several episodes into the season, we haven't learned much about the children, though. They're not really featured in the story lines and no one child stands out above the others. The boys tend to be unruly and it's understandable, as the family has no table around which to eat and mealtimes often become chaotic. Manners fall by the wayside. (You'd think contractor Brady could build one dining hall for the entire family to eat in instead of having to hold plates on laps.)Brady, who does not seem to be all that charismatic or appealing, tries to appease all the women. Of course that is impossible, we all know that. And every conversation when there's a problem or disagreement among the women or they with Brady seems staged. He seems to be reading from some conflict resolution handbook every time he answers them. He always says, ""I hear what you're saying,"" and then he repeats their grievance and gives some kind of wishy washy answer but that is often just what the woman wants to hear. His responses, frankly, don't seem natural and I wonder if he would be so kind and understanding if the cameras weren't filming.Despite what appears to be playing to the cameras, some of the women claim that he is not always very fair  and it does appear that he has favorites  but how is it possible to love five women at once and be fair to everyone? It's the lifestyle in and of itself that doesn't promote fairness.","Dull, for the most part.",1398038400,"04 21, 2014"

"Alex and his fellow film school friends receive a mysterious video link that suggests the frightening images from the GRAVE ENCOUNTERS film may have been for real. The group gathers their cameras and heads out to the old insane asylum where the film was originally shot to investigate, only to fall victim to the same insatiable spirits! GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 shares all of the first film's weaknesses without finding any of its strengths. At first, it seems like the makers may be parodying the ""found footage"" genre just as they had done with the popular ghost hunting TV shows from before. By the end of the the first act, however, we come to the frightening realization that the atrocious acting, idiotic characters, and recycled plot points are all being taken seriously. The story borrows generously from Dave Parker's THE HILLS RUN RED with a touch of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY as John Poliquin and the Vicious Brothers prove to us that they have nothing new to bring to the table in this second installment. The same cheap effects and obnoxious scare tactics are employed once more, but what is the point of using the ""found footage"" format when the images on screen are exaggerated to such an extreme? It then becomes impossible to accept any of the footage as being ""authentic,"" thereby destroying the illusion and rendering the film a complete failure. A little subtlety goes a long way, which is a lesson that the makers of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS have yet to learn. Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies",ILHM Reviews: Grave Encounters 2,1362873600,"03 10, 2013"

"Right now I am counting on Amazon for quality VOD programs.  I am will to pay a fair price for a show that has value and from which I learn a lot such as ""The Americans"". But instead of enjoying my show, I have to deal Fox's lousy commercials.  ""The Americans""  gets interrupted with ""Justified"", ""Archer"", and ""Bran X"" ads, and I could not think of more annoying adverts than those.  I gave ""Justified"" a chance by buying season 1, but it did not stick.  I also gave ""Brand X"" a try by watching one episode at Fox's site, but I just don't like to show.

"Perhaps the fact that ""Meeting Evil"" is written and directed by someone responsible for ""S. Darko,"" a pointless and confusing ""sequel"" to a cult cljazzic ""Donnie Darko,"" would be worth mentioning. Yes, ""Meeting Evil"" is a mess. Well, it's not exactly a total mess, thanks to the star Samuel L. Jackson and his mesmerizing performance, though I would rather be watching him in a superhero franchise or Quentin Tarantino film.Luke Wilson plays John Felton, a down and out real estate agent, who is visited by a mysterious guy, Samuel L. Jackson's ""Richie."" Richie seems interested in John, who, dejected and angry, barely controls his emotions. Richie follows John, even when it is obvious John doesn't like it, and wherever Ritchie goes, strange things happen, like people suddenly disappearing.So who is Richie and what is his motive? Without revealing too much about the movie, I would only say that the story doesn't make much sense. The storyline is incoherent and illogical (not in an intriguing way like a David Lynch film), and the subplot about a young woman Tammy (Peyton List) goes nowhere. You notice so many lapses of logic and so much inexplicable decision making, hoping that they will be explained away before the film ends.But that doesn't happen. (You don't see a big explosion on the DVD jacket, either, if I remember correctly). About 30 minutes in, the film gets boring as we come to realize that the film is nothing but a poorly jazzorted collection of clich&eacute; ideas.",Meeting Samuel L.

"I can't say it was a useful propostion except for mixing up the labelling. He started out as part man but mostly guru and endes up as mostly man and part guru. When he was unveiling himself, it took a long time; he did not appear shaven and talking in an american voice in one shot. This was so his students could make the transition without going into shock and he jazzures them a part of him is ""still Kumara"".It would have been diabolical to have forced them to make their own sudden transitions because not all could have survived. The 10 14 received an empowering transformation that they have the power to be their own guru. The main problem seems to be that they need support and affirmation and they can't do it alone. Presumably going to church is not enough or it is too old fashioned.There is a deeper question to this film. Is Kumara an atheist or an agnostic.? If he isn't  does he know he thinks like one? To an atheist it is obvious people create God,  not the other way around. It easy to translate the metaphor into what he did ; the higher Self was used to illustrate we create it all. The relationship with Ghandi is so one on one ,that it is a short cut on the God abstraction,which is why it never crops up and why there is so much dependence fom the students. But I do wonder if Ghandi is being reticient. ( also  true if he was an agnostic)I was impressed by how decent the seekers were and how important this value was. It transcends any foolhardy exposure, which they may have unwittingly brought on themselves.I got a kick out of seeing my own yoga group of choice flash on screen. I have been where these students are withthe whole sublimation of identity into the yoga one. I crashed. The way into self is through an agnostic atheist route,I found.

"I should not have paid as much as I did to watch this pre theatrical release.  I did so because I thought a documentary based upon the book ""Freakonomics"" would be very interesting.  There were a number of interesting points in the film, but this is just one more case where the reviewer says that the book was much better.  The main problem I had with the film is that it presented so little information in the time allotted.  I believe this was because it attempted to be entertaining as well as the directors personalizing the content and wasting time by injecting too much of themselves into the content.  This lead to a boring documentary where I felt cheated of time and money because so little real content was presented.  I suggest reading the book and skipping the movie.  If you would rather watch a film than to read a book, then wait til after the film is released in theaters and distributed on DVD.  I do not think this film will be able to command a high price for very long after it is distributed on DVD and you should be able to rent or buy it at a discounted price.  This book is essentially about looking at common phenomina from different or non standard points of view.  In doing so, there really is no timely earthshaking material so you will not have missed much by waiting for lower prices.  I still believe the book or the film contain perspectives that make them worthwhile, but the film barely earns an average rating in my opinion which is generous in this instance.",Documentary based upon much better book,1285113600,"09 22, 2010"

It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as ""banging"") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; ""banging"" the other guy's mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is brew each other over.

Will Nathan see the error of his ways before everyone is captured or killed?The problem with this season lay in the story telling.  When the show was actually good (back in season 1), the episodes spent time with the characters, letting us get to know them so we cared about what they were doing or why.  That really drew me in.  Here, we are forced plot points with cardboard characters.  Heck, I had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what to whom it changed so often.  And I just don't care about the characters the way I used to because there is no depth to them.Then there's the case of Sylar.  Don't get me wrong, I think Zachary Quinto is a great actor.  But the way they keep including that character in events is forced and makes me wonder if we'll ever actually go somewhere with the story.Yes, I am still intrigued to see where they are going next to keep watching, but just barely.
