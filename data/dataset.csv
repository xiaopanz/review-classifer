This series demonstrated the risks and hard work of the truckers that bid for their work online.  It was painful to see the sacrifices and trading of one's health in this profession.

"It used to be that the only European films that could succeed in the US market were war films being able to pull in the ticket sales and the Academy Awards.  Examples include Battle of Algiers, Battleship Potemkin, Das Boot, and Lawrence of Arabia.  More recently, European filmmakers have been successful in other genres, such as romance (A Very Long Engagement), crime (Stieg Larsson's Millenium trilogy, Layer Cake), fantasy (Pan's Labyrinth) and comedy (Waking Ned Devine).  This success has been geographical in spread, starting with movies from the UK, France and Spain, and spreading West to the rest of Europe.  Finally, Scandinavian films are catching up.  Starting with the Swedish Millenium trilogy, followed by the cult horror cljazzic, Let The Right One In, and last year's Finnish Rare Exports, 2011 saw the release of the Norwegian film Trollhunter.  Part comedy, part horror, and part fantasy, this film follows the mockumentary style of the Blair Witch Project, though it is less scary and less shaky.  This feature length film follows a supposed trollhunter, an employee of Norway's government, who is jazzigned to track down and kill trolls that have left their refuge.  For those willing to put up with subtitles, this is a very impressive film.  The special effects are quite good, though this is helped by the fact that all the trolls are seen at night, which allows the filmmakers space in leaving out visual details such as skin texture, hair movement, etc...  The overall story line is quite original, and the movie is quite enjoyable.",One more great film from Europe,1317686400,"10 4, 2011",4,1
"My son and I decided to try Teen Wolf and see if it was any good, we were hooked by the first episode and now on the 3rd Season and find it still a good show to watch.  I would not let young kids watch.  Love the characters, especially Stilles and hunky Derek.  The show has violence of course were dealing with Werewolves here, but not too gory or gross.  We watch while eating lunch.There is also comic relief in each episode.  Hope the writers keep up the fast pace and interesting storylines.",Love this show,1400284800,"05 17, 2014",5,1
"The Pilot wasn't great, though it certainly had the credibility for a long running show. The biggest mystery leaves us empty at the end of the pilot, and the frequent F bombs are unnecessary to the plot. Lots of rough characters, but the animals that come in with guns blazing have no idea what they waste when they blow through the gates. A person or group could have survived for ages in a mansion like that. I think of Bill Murray's mansion in Zombieland.",this was a story I would follow,1393200000,"02 24, 2014",4,1
"By now those who watch know who the judges are. But i will get to that shortly. The show is as they say ""the biggest cooking contest in the world today"".  Hell's Kitchen is in it's 11th season, and now casting for its 12th season. So I don't believe yelling or screaming has anything to do with whether it is a good show or worth watching or not.  In this country, they are so money hungry (tv stations), they take shows off just after 11 episodes no matter how great the show or actors (Monday Mornings, TNT).  The format is the same. You have Joe, Graham, and who is considered the best chef in the world today, Gordon Ramsay. Gordon presently has 21 Restaurants and 15 Stars if google was correct.The chefs seem to be better.  They seem to have really went for the throat in this season, getting rid of people who they thought were not meant for the contest even while they were still cooking in a challenge. Joe still getting angry and throwing out the people's plates right into the garbage.  Gordon, while not yelling, is as insulting as ever and it's great. Graham is just a really nice and great guy who just tells it as it is.The food seems to be more complex early in this season. And from the commercials, it seems they will have many more interesting challenges. The only thing that is very predictable is that they hardly ever give Graham the final word on who stays. Yes on some. But what they do is have for example, Joe says No, then Graham you just know is going to say yes to the contestant, so its up to Gordon. Then it goes the other way. Gordon says yes, Graham says no, then its up to Joe. I wish they would give more decision making to Graham.  He is young and and on fire with two Stars now, the second given for his take on Pea Soup, and he cooked for the president of the United States, so he is climbing fast as a chef. Not the star of the show, which is Gordon Ramsay himself, but He is one of the youngest best chef's in the country today. It was a great job for the casting.  They really needed Graham for this show to give it a ease, and some humor.I think if you have liked this show in the past you will really love this season. Everything just seems to be more fast paced, food more complex, and it seems to me that we are left with very good home chef's early in the season. Which i think will make for an interesting 4th season, and with all the shows Gordon has and the years his shows have been on, it's obvious the country loves the show and for good reasons.  enjoy and have fun with it...",Still Getting Better,1370217600,"06 3, 2013",5,1

"Seldom does a film or tv version of a book make me want to read the book. The few exceptions are a few BBC productions of detective novels, including the Inspector Morse series. So this pilot was surprising to me, as now I want to read everything Connelly has written.This pilot creates a singular universe that it draws you into, and that's Bosch's universe. The complexity of his character comes across quite well and the slow unfolding of both the trial and the crime Harry is investigating is tantalizing. I will definitely watch this series, and the point at which this ended has me wishing it were an hour longer than it was. Its pace is perfect (some might call it slow, but they are likely not those who pay attention to the subtleties of a character ), and the lead made it easy to imagine what was going through Harry Bosch's mind. Those &#34;slow&#34; scenes always had a very satisfying payoff. I'm a fan!",Have not read the series but LOVED the pilot. And want more.,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",5,1
"I missed the series when originally shown, so I have been catching up through instant viewing on Amazon. I watch...let's just say TOO many...of the housewives franchises. I have to say though that this is the most gripping. I like that certainly at the start, all the housewives were TRUE housewives. I also like how the men are featured just as much as the women really; it makes for a more well rounded show. Instead of just the women going on trips together, the husbands...and even grown children...come along too. One thing I will echo, is that the family drama between Teresa, Joe and Melissa has now been a bit played. Perhaps with the casting shake up, the show will have more to offer from season six forward.",Addicted,1395360000,"03 21, 2014",4,1
"How can you beat that combination?  This is an appropriate film for young adults, not so much for us older folks.  But it's stylish and well produced, with good acting and a minimum of hokiness considering it's basically a vampire movie.The vampiress, Ernessa, who looks like she's post Barbie doll plastic surgery  manages to convince cljazzmates in a girl's school situated in a former hotel to disappear in various ways in order to get to the one girl who interests her the most, Becca (for a specific reason that I won't reveal).  Nobody but Becca notices that there's something strange about her.  Ernessa is not evil so much as needy for certain things, trapped in an existence she doesn't want but is stuck with. In the end, Becca comes through for her in a messy but very pragmatic way, her blood supply intact (maybe that's what Ernessa was planning all along, clever girl).  Happy ending.","Pretty girls, repressed sexuality, blood, moths, and death",1390694400,"01 26, 2014",4,1

"I love this TV show, because it has come together, acting and writing. I came across this show during the third season when it was well coordinated. I am a fan of Gilmore Girls and was the reason for how I was interested in Parenthood. The story lines are well crafted capturing human emotion. This is a lovable story line with three generations of the same family, and all the trials and tribulations family goes through. Some characters have developed roles like Adam Braverman as the protecting father and husband. Crosby as the adventurous yet good guy underneath the thick shell. Sarah who goes from relationship to relationship, and as such is defined by them. Julia the stereotypical successful lawyer balancing family life, Joel her stereotypical supportive husband and father. There are few stereotypical characters, however most of the characters move back and forth between their portrayed characteristics and good ones. Season four and three are by my opinion the best so far all because of writing and acting. Season five is coming back on NBC September 26th, until then I will watch marathons of these seasons. If you enjoy sitcoms based around families than other TV shows, this is a great show for you. Each show has a cliffhanger for each story arc, which keeps you hooked. This is one of the best sitcoms on TV, though there is a lack of minority representation. When season five comes out I will be ordering it from Amazon too. Until than Parenthood returns to NBC September 26th moving from Tuesdays to Thursdays.",Best Sitcom on TV,1378425600,"09 6, 2013",5,1

"and everything in between during the 10th season of ""Stargate: SG 1"". By the way, this ISN'T the end of SG 1 as two direct to video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines. During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori, the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Vala (Claudia Black). The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up, new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt. Colonel Cameron Mitchell (Ben Browder well known to sci fi fans from ""Farscape"")and Vala (Claudia Black anther ""Farscape"" alum)providing the show with an additional injection of energy. Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well. Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are (with the exception of a few) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times. The stand alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on ""The X Files"" and ""Farscape"" these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes. Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina (represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected)where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode. As a long time ""Farscape"" fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance, they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7. Nothing could be further from the truth. The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil. The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis (Davis' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine)who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars (Fred Willard, Robert Picardo a regular on ""Star Trek: Voyager"" started appearing in season 9) helped spruce up the last season of the show. It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers. Most of you won't notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc. The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8. I'm sure these will show up on Blu Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one (and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks. They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track), deleted scenes, featurettes in the Director's Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc. We also got the usual jazzortment of photo and production galleries included as well. There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct to video movies ""Stargate SG 1: The Ark of Truth"" (the second one also coming in 2008 is ""Stargate SG 1: Continuum"" involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson).The 10th season varies but overall it's a good one that SG 1 fans will enjoy.","It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...",1186272000,"08 5, 2007",4,1

"You know who Hannibal Lector is, even if you've never seen ""Red Dragon"" or ""The Silence of the Lambs""    a witty, cultured man who happens to be a cannibalistic serial killer.He is also the sinister heart of ""Hannibal: Season One,"" a TV show somewhat based on the works and characters of Thomas Harris. This is one of the smartest shows on television today    a thorny, dark hearted psychodrama, full of subtle manipulation and dangerous killers. It took a few episodes for me to fully warm up to Mads Mikkelson, but after awhile his quietly aesthetic portrayal really caught on.FBI special investigator Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) has a special gift    he is able to empathize with serial killers, understanding how their minds work. Agent Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) enlists him to help in the most bizarre serial killing cases, and enlists forensic psychiatrist Hannibal Lector (Mikkelson) to keep Will from going off the rails.And frankly, Will needs the help. His first case involves a cannibalistic serial killer known as the Minnesota Shrike, who kills young girls and almost murders his daughter Abigail. As Will struggles with the aftermath of this case, he is called in on a series of bizarre murders    people turned into grotesque angels, mutilated into instruments, used as fungal fertilizer, missing children turned into murderers, an organ harvester, and a man who claims to be the notorious Chesapeake Ripper.But Will suspects that a copycat killer is at large, using other serial killers as a smokescreen for his own activities. He doesn't suspect that the copycat killer is far closer than he thinks: Dr. Lector (this isn't much of a spoiler    it's revealed in the first episode), who manipulates Crawford, Will, his shrink friend Dr. Alana Bloom (Caroline Dhavernas), and anyone else who falls into his orbit. Oh, and he eats people.Bryan Fuller has always had a macabre streak (see ""Pushing Daisies"" or ""Dead Like Me""), but in ""Hannibal,"" that streak covers the whole canvas. Don't expect quirkiness or comedy in this    it's all shadows, grey skies and blood, with only a few lighter moments (Will spending time with his dogs) to gently remind you that the world is not all horror.It also doesn't have any supernatural quirks, yet it still maintains a dreamlike, almost mystical quality through Will's hallucinations, and the ghostlike elusiveness of the killers. Lector himself is almost like an elegant demon, conjuring complicated tortures and schemes while also listening to cljazzical music and frying up gourmet meals of human flesh. His cultured calm seems almost inhuman, his cold sadism and elusiveness almost beyond human understanding.It's also gory. Very gory. Admittedly you can't have a story about serial killers and cannibalism without some gore, but it has some truly grotesque, stomach churning stuff that you wouldn't expect to find on network shows.And while coming up with a bunch of one off serial killings    only some of which are successfully stopped    the writers weave in elaborate subplots involving a potentially psychotic teenager, the Chesapeake killer, a murdered protege of Crawford's, and Will's increasing mental deterioration. Every episode creeps us closer to Will figuring out what is truly going on, and who is pulling the strings on everyone around him.Dancy plays Will as a shaky, damaged man whose special talents are slowly destroying him, but who feels that he must continue to save others' lives. Fishburne is the steady rock at the center of the show, an essentially decent man who must sacrifice Will's well being so that other people have a chance to live. And it has good supporting performances by Dhavernas, Gillian Anderson and Hettienne Park.I have to admit, Mads Mikkelson annoyed me for the first two episodes    he seemed very pjazzionless and wooden at first. But his acting style began to grow on me as we see the few things that bring a sparkle to his eye (mostly cljazzical music), and explore some of his cold, friendless world.""Hannibal Season One"" is a series as rich and dark as spilled lifeblood... and about as horrifying.

"Inspector Foyle behaves and speaks exactly as we would ideally wish to have done in his place in the threatening environment of wartime where subtlety and nuance tended to get lost. In WWII Hastings, a resort town on the south coast of England, the proximity of the German forces across the Channel pushed people to make hasty decisions, often based on prejudice and invariably without pausing to reflect. Foyle is the epitome of patience, bravely resisting pressure from his superiors and the war department, creating time and space to see justice done no matter how complex the circumstances, He is jazzisted by two younger jazzistants who share his humanity and learn from his stoical attitude. It is hard not to feel that people like Foyle were the true heroes of the war effort because they constantly reminded everyone of the values we were fighting for.",Diplomatic police work in time of war,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",4,1

"While I LOVE Castle and have watched every episode I am really not liking the DC job thing that is going on, so far they have cut out a chunk of the cast and replaced them with unlikeable characters.  The stories are too NCIS and little humor that has been a large part of the show's appeal.I do understand that perhaps the NY cop situation needed some new blood or something, this is not working for me and I hope they go back to the old backdrop soon, I don't care for DC in real life, why would I want more of it in my entertainment.Castle and Beckett are still great but without the talented cast they had backing them up (not the boring unlikeable current DC players) I don't know if they can keep the audience to keep going for another season.",Am I The Only One That HATES The DC scenario?,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",4,1

"I noticed that this, one of my top 25 favorite movies, was available for streaming with Prime, and read some of the reviews.  I was floored to see some of the poor reviews.  Not that it must be everybody's cup of tea, but how is it people can watch and not have a CLUE what it's about?  Minor spoilers as to themes follow.Yes, it's offbeat.  Yes, it's told in an unusual way.  The old adage ""Show, don't tell"" is followed throughout, and perfectly so.  But for goodness sake  isn't the time spent viewing a movie worth a little reflection on its meaning?  The absurd events of Muriel's life mirror the absurdity of life writ large.  The movie's about a young woman who wants desperately to BE somebody.  She's shy, awkward, weird, doesn't know how to behave, inevitably says and does the wrong thing.  The in crowd shuns her, and still she tries to gain acceptance.  Those efforts are demonstrated against the backdrop of relations with her dysfunctional family of misfits.  She resents and yet is an amalgam of her parents  her mother, fat, insecure and self loathing, her father, a grandiose liar who will go to any dishonest lengths to seem important, make the news, garner attention by any means possible (he's a politician).  The mother just wants to be valued by her husband and children, to no avail.  Muriel's younger siblings are even more pathetic than she, and actually look to hapless Muriel for inspiration and guidance.  Oh my.The movie is about Muriel's quest to find out who she is and find meaning in life, the Holy Grail of quests (though not necessarily her realized goal  at first she just wants to LIVE).  She tries various desperate things, some inspired by her parents' behavior and values (I won't list them), but the biggie is finding a husband and having a fancy wedding, however possible, by hook or by crook  THAT will show everybody.  She gets herself into trouble ever more deep.  In the midst of all this, she meets an old school chum, someone slightly more evolved, who doesn't care WHAT other people think (the fabulous Rachel Griffiths).  Griffiths becomes a friend and role model, has an effect most profound on Muriel.  They get an apartment together, and Muriel just begins to spread her wings  and tragedy hits.This movie is all about life, fraught with disappointments, unkind people, and misfortunes foreseeable and unforeseeable (and yet  there are other ways to look at it).  It's about seeing yourself anew, taking the blinders off.  It's about the myriad ways we delude ourselves, inventing things to value and feel good about  often valuing style and mere appearance over substance and character.  It's about longing to change, to be your own person, to be a person of integrity, instead of a colossal brew up.  And parenthetically, what is integrity?  So few people exhibit it.  And yet, it's everything, the most essential thing  without it you've got nothing.  And finally, it's about what it truly means to love other people.  Or so say I, anyway  these were some of the things I came away with.Come to think of it, these are some of the themes of another wonderful Toni Collette film (an adult drama), made a few years later,Japanese Story.This sounds like solemn stuff indeed, but it's not, that's what's so wonderful  the reality seeps into your emotional pores through osmosis, themes reverberate between a series of intriguing, memorable scenes, some funny, some ridiculous, some tragic (e.g., her mother's clothesline in the back yard.)  No one hits you over the head with anything, you figure it out for yourself.  The ending of this movie is one of my favorite film endings ever  things look pretty bad, how could they get any worse?  But DON'T count this fat, pathetic loser out YET.The triumphant scene where the cabdriver throws opens the cab door, with ABBA playing, is one of those quintessential, iconic movie moments that etches itself into your very psyche: ""Leave 'em burning and then you're gone...""  I saw this in a large theater when it came out, and it got a standing ovation.  If you don't like this, or at least appreciate the themes, you must be made of wood.  This movie made marvels Toni Collette and Rachel Griffiths international stars, and rightly so.  BRAVO.","Fat, Pathetic LOSER Muriel- MY HERO!",1380844800,"10 4, 2013",5,1

"This was my intoroduction to sci fi when I was in 2nd grade.  Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory.  Upon watching them again, I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated, both in their science and in the lack of ""feel good"" deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is ""The Man Who was Never Born"", which exudes a kind of timeless anguish.  It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau, who was truly brilliant.  But the ""Architects of Fear"" is also wonderful, with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form.  They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them, truly unique. ""The Galaxy Being"" and ""The Sixth Finger"" are also deeply affecting and believable in their way.  These are all timeless themes in hard sci fi, done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too, but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission.  I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes   it doesn't cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi.","Absolutely first rate hard sci-fi, never surpassed on TV",1246320000,"06 30, 2009",5,1

"Originally picked this to watch because I am a huge Eric Bana fan.  Then as I watched, I realized I had hooked into a really good little noir type thriller.  I had never seen Charlie Hunnam previously, but thought he did a really solid job here, as did Olivia Wilde (Thirteen from the HOUSE series).  Even the smaller roles (Kate Mara, Kris Kristofferson, Sissy Spacek and Treat Williams) were believably performed in a forceful manner.Bana and Wilde play brother and sister, on the run after a casino heist, who get separated in the frozen wilderness, only to be finally reunited at the Thanksgiving dinner of Hunnam's family, where the movie comes to a thrilling climax.  Along the way there some truly exciting chases, one particularly great one on snowmobiles, interspersed with a few brief moments of uncertain tenderness between Wilde and Hunnam.This is one I'm truly happy I stumbled across.

"THE GREAT BUCK  HOWARD is a charming, breezy, fairly family friendly movie with a nice cast and an almost old fashioned vibe.  It's far from a great movie, and yet it has a quirky originality that makes it worth a look.Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a mentalist.  In fact, his act is based on The Amazing Kreskin, the hypnotist mentalist magician who frequently appeared on Johnny Carson and other talk shows like that.  Buck is a fading star however, playing to half empty theaters in mid sized cities all around the country.  His audience is mostly senior citizens who clearly remember this guy from his days of appearing on THE DINAH SHORE SHOW.  His act is sort of dreadful...yet it's sort of amazing too.  Colin Hanks plays Troy, a law school dropout who wants to be a writer, but stumbles into the job of being Buck's road manager.The film follows Buck on tour, as he works to achieve a comeback of sorts.  He doesn't quite seem to get that the likelihood of that is very dim.  He isn't deluded enough to think his career is in great shape (he gets that he's become, at best, a third rate celebrity), but he DOES think that he just needs that one piece of great publicity to rocket himself back into stardom.The movie takes a bumpy but fairly unsurprising road.  It's mostly the charming performers who make it worth watching (and the excellent art & costume direction).  Hanks is looking more like his father Tom all the time, and while he doesn't have the gravitas his dad has, he's a nice performer who one day is probably cut out to star in a TV series.  (He was excellent during his guest stint on MAD MEN).  His Troy is something of a blank...if we didn't get the occasional voice over narration, we would really struggle to know what kinds of inner turmoil Troy is going through...the script doesn't reveal much about him through the events of the film; he's mostly an observer.  Emily Blunt, always welcome, is the publicist who tries to get Buck some national exposure, and also embarks on a predictable but fairly chaste (at least, on screen) romance with Troy.  Steve Zahn, again an always welcome presence, shows up briefly as a sort of limo driver.  Griffin Dunne makes a cameo appearance.  Tom Hanks even shows up in two scenes as Troy's father (what a stretch!!).  He's a producer on the film, so no doubt his influence helped land the film it's plethora of guest stars, including Conan O'Brien, Regis, Kelly, Leno, Tom Arnold, etc.  (Arnold has about two lines, both throwaways, and both really funny if you're listening).The core of the film is Malkovich.  I still remember when he was an amazing, credible actor who could play weird characters and make them believable.  He has long ago sunk into just being weird most of the time.  But his Buck Howard is almost a return to his glory days.  The script is too slight to REALLY give us an idea of what is going on inside Buck...but Malkovich launches into the PERSONA of this man with relish and a real sense of fun.  It isn't exactly a believable character...but we're mostly only seeing the Buck Howard that his shrinking public sees.  Wacky but charming.  Enthusiastic but prone to fits of petty anger.  Able to charm men & women alike (we never even know what sexual orientation Buck is...even though there's speculation in the film). We have to guess a lot at any inner turmoil he might be feeling (much like with the character of Troy).There's a truly probing story in here somewhere, but the writer director apparently wasn't interested in anything too emotional or insightful.  It's a fluffy piece, where any bad feelings are quickly overcome.  It doesn't take its subject matter lightly, exactly...but it does feel like a conscious decision to make this story breezy.  For what it attempts, THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD gets a big smile and a mild recommendation from me.I said the movie was family friendly.  There was virtually no bad language I can remember (it's only PG rated), and the relationship between Blunt and Hanks is mostly hugging and kissing.  (We get that they must sleep together, but other than them sitting on a bed necking while fully clothed, that's all we see.)  A child of 12 or older with a willingness to see a film outside the ordinary might like this film...or they might find it merely a puzzling curiosity.  And not knowing how big THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JOHNNY CARSON once was might detract.","Modest, quirky and very charming, with a wonderful cast.",1267833600,"03 6, 2010",4,1

"I'll begin by saying that I was wrong. I'm of the generation that lived and breathed the 1987 Ninja Turtles. I first saw the trailer for this cartoon and thought it was a cheap CGI ripoff of the franchise.But then I watched the first episode and fell in love all over again. It made me feel the way I did all those years ago growing up with the Turtles. Except, unlike the 1987 cartoon, which hasn't aged well, this show looks and feels fresh. The 87 cartoon was corny and the animation was often inconsistent at best. By contrast, the writing for this series is actually pretty decent for a cartoon. Each episode is self contained, but I like how the build upon a larger story with some continuous characters and elements. The action is well paced but also allows time for character moments. Best of all, the show is genuinely funny. Not goofy, corny, ""I can't believe I'm watching this"" funny, but some real ""laugh out load"" moments.I think this show has potential to revive the Ninja Turtles franchise.

"""Grabbers"" is a ridiculously fun monster movie. It's in the vein of ""Critters"" or ""Tremors,"" but with a more modern spin on it like ""Slither,"" ""Attack the Block,"" or even Bong Joon ho's ""The Host."" There's just as much of an emphasis on comedy that there is on horror though like ""Shaun of the Dead."" It's refreshing to see a horror film of this caliber utilizing well executed CGI for its creature effects. It only adds to the film's long list of excellent features.The film starts off simple with a meteor landing in the sea with its contents wreaking havoc on a fishing boat. You're introduced to O'Shea, his drinking problem, and his shocking ability to function with a hangover. You're also introduced to Lisa Nolan (Ruth Bradley), a strictly by the books police officer sent to help out the island. Lisa's evolution over the course of the film is extraordinary considering how uptight she is at first. She naturally loosens up once she begins drinking and is quite a hilarious drunk. The relationship that develops between O'Shea and Lisa is also something that slowly bubbles to the surface in a natural kind of way. Richard Coyle and Ruth Bradley share a scene in a car in the second half of the film that is genuinely touching.Other elements in the film are just as impressive. Christian Henson's score for the film is noticeably superb. At the beginning of the film, there's this scene where Paddy Barrett (Lalor Roddy) walks onto the beach and the camera is directly behind them. It's early in the morning and it's a beautiful scene, but then the camera finally pans up and you're able to see what's lying on the beach. The score does this amazing job of faking you out. It has this incredible tone shift from completely happy and carefree to atmospheric horror that is astounding. ""Grabbers"" is absolutely gorgeous to look at, as well. Mostly shot in Northern Ireland, admiring these serene landscapes ""Grabbers"" puts on display and the way it's able to show reflecting light on the cusp of the horizon is just magnificent. The scenery is truly a sight to behold in ""Grabbers.""Seeing how the creatures toy with their food is a nice little story point. A soon to be victim hears a pounding at the door. When he answers, he sees what he thinks is a drunken acquaintance but the visitor is moving in questionable fashion. In reality, the creature has used this poor man's corpse as a puppet as a way to lure this other man out of his house. While the Grabbers rely on animal instinct to survive, they do show intelligence. ""Grabbers"" teases their reveal as well. When the film first begins, you question whether or not you'll actually get to see what they look like.""Grabbers"" is way more entertaining than it should be. Its premise is simple, but its cast is brilliant, its story is structurally solid, its characters are genuine, and it features are monster that is both unique and eyecatching.

"This documentary about the home video VCR boom leaves no stone unturned.  It's primarily gonna appeal to, not only people who lived through the era, but people who were really into movies, especially cult films.  A lot of screen time is dedicated to cult and horror films, and there are many interviews with people from that scene like Frank Hennenlotter and Lloyd Kaufman.  This makes sense considering it's the cult audience that still embraces the VHS format.  Your average Avengers fan is really less likely to care.It's a very thorough documentary, covering the birth of the format, the companies that utilized it, the modern day collectors and even a VHS merchant who still runs a shop.  Lots of ground is covered, and it's clear that this documentary was a labor of love.  For folks like me, it's a very welcome trip down memory lane.  In fact, kinda depressing in a way.

"The commentary on high flying bankers will resonate today, as Bernie Madoff was actually conceived 150 years ago by Charles Dickens.  Madoff's and the fictional Mr. Merdle's stories are virtually the same.  See, this is what happens when high finance is left to its own devices:  it ends up cheating to maintain that euphoric 50% return.  But when the pyramid collapses, the economy is left in tatters and lives are ruined.  The 19th century was riddled with financial panics because foxes were guarding the henhouses.  After about a century of these cyclical bubbles, government oversight was firmly established in the 1930s.  Unfortunately, we gradually forgot these lessons and allowed ourselves to be taken in again.  Five years after the collapse, we still haven't recovered.  Read your Dickens, or watch this well mounted series from the BBC, and relearn those lessons.Financial ups and downs characterize ""Little Dorrit"", as we watch the roller coaster ride that the Dorrit family takes from riches to rags to riches to rags again.  The story has the usual Dickens ingredients:  noble heroes and heroines, crusty caricatures of servants, exotic supporting players, convoluted plots with unconvincing resolutions.  Along with many 19th century novels, this story displays severe infection from Shakespeare:  quite apart from the convoluted plot with its ""big reveals"" at the end, so characteristic of Shakespeare's ""late romances"" that were particularly popular in the Victorian era (cf. ""Cymbeline"", ""The Winter's Tale"", ""The Tempest""), the character of the Dorrit patriarch is a none too subtle sketch of King Lear, with his three children (two bad, and a third good daughter), his retreat into fantasy to escape harsh realities, his occasional descents into madness.  Somewhat ironic, this, as I had always thought that Tom Courtenay's greatest role was in ""The Dresser"", where he plays an jazzistant to a mad Albert Finney who plays Lear.  But I think it turns out that his performance here might very well go down as his greatest.  Wow.  I hope he won awards.  Other good performances:  Matthew Macfadyen as the almost ethereal Arthur Clennam.  Clennam is the purest example of the Dickens noble hero, and Macfadyen never hits an inconsistent note, despite temptations offered by the story.  Claire Foy as the eponymous heroine seems unprepossessing and too timid at first, but that's consistent with Dickens' design.  She wears very well, and gathers strength, as things go on.  Judy Parfitt portrays a block of granite excellently.  Eddie Marsan as the hyperactive landlord is amusing, snorting between every word.  One VERY serious blot, though:  Andy Serkis as the murderous villain Rigaud.  Serkis appears to believe that he's playing Gollum again:  getting right up into people's personal space, whispering to them nose to nose, caressing their cheeks.  He even climbs up a house at one point:  one is reminded of Mount Doom.  (Does he do this with every role?)  He plays the character in such a repellent manner that it's hard to see how he would be tolerated in any sphere of higher English society, even among dissipated wanna be young painters.Another blot:  there's a subplot involving an independent young woman who steals a young African companion from another rich family.  It wasn't very good in the novel; here, they try    unsuccessfully    to turn it into something else.  After a few episodes, however, they don't even follow up with what they started.  The depiction of this ""Tattycorum"" character and her subplot is far too fraught with 21st century concerns and sensitivities; screenwriter Andrew Davies would've been better advised to axe it altogether.  Miss Wade and Tattycorum are not all that integral to the foundations of the climax, anyway.But, on the whole, a very nice way to spend 8 or 9 hours.  4 out of 5 stars.",The financial subplot is ruefully applicable to today,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",4,1

"Bow your heads, people    ""Laserblast"" is the very strange end of an era in MST3K era, shifting from one deranged villain to another.But even as their lives change forever, the Satellite of Love dudes must watch a devastatingly bad movie that somehow got two and a half stars from Leonard Maltin, and even inexplicably got a cameo from Roddy friggin' McDowall. And in the meantime, they are confronted by disasters from cljazzic science fiction!Crow, Mike and Tom are horrified when Dr. F suddenly disconnects the umbilicus from the Satellite, meaning that they are adrift in space without air or supplies. Turns out Dr. F has lost his funding and is now moving in with his mother Pearl. But there's a not so bright side: he's giving the guys a film to watch!That film is ""Laserblast,"" in which stop motion turtle aliens lose an arm cannon in the desert. It's found by a sullen slacker that everybody picks on, and who has a terrifying looking mom who is apparently a prostitute. But as the slacker takes revenge against everybody who has ever made his life miserable, the weapon starts turning him into a crazy green mutant.MST3K's snark of ""Laserblast"" is really a turning point for the series    it starts the transition from Dr. Forrester to his mom Pearl, and leads to the Satellite being set adrift IN SPAAAAAAACE. Granted, Mike and the bots don't seem hugely worried, since they not so happily trot off to watch the movie and make fun of the fact that Leonard Maltin gave it two and a half stars.And between chunks of cinematic poo, they get up to silliness making fun of science fiction    Crow undertakes an Apollo 13 style mission, Monad (annoying cousin to Nomad) is mocked by the bots, Mike briefly becomes Captain Janeway, and a trip to the edge of the universe has some very surprising results.And as usual, the snark is delicious (""Oh Billy, between your musty blankets, your scabby chest holes and your back fat...""), especially when they point out the horrible dialogue (""She undercut the subtle nuance of my wiener joke!"") and Coke produce placement.""Laserblast's"" snarking marks the end of an era for Mystery Science Theater 3000, but it remains a delightfully weird example of how they make even a dull, poorly made sci fi movie entertaining.",Ready for some FOOTBAAAAAAALLLL....,1327622400,"01 27, 2012",4,1

"I like the new Major Crimes with all the cast from The Closer though I still prefer the Closer and wish Kyra Sedgwick hadn't quit the series. With her went some of the other actors parts and hopefully they had some other place to go though the new series that Jon Tenney stars in now King and Maxwell seems to be doing OK. JK Simmons who played Pope is doing Farmers Insurance commercials as well as some movies. What happened to Corey Reynolds whose character supposedly left with Brenda? I haven't seen him show up anywhere so far.Mary McDonnell is great and I really like how they have softened her character a bit with her taking in Rusty and a really nice relationship has developed there. Now they have brought in her ex husband so that is proving to create some interesting situations. Of course the transition would not have been complete without the characters of Flynn and Provinza and the interesting capers they get themselves into. I think in time this series will be as good and if possible maybe better than The Closer.I do know I am getting tired of actors and actresses that are up and quitting after being on a successful series. Now we get to look forward to Cote de Pablo's leaving NCIS after the first 2 episodes of the new season after being a very integral member of team Gibbs for 7 years.

"""Arbitrage"" (2012 release; 100 min.) stars Richard Gere as Robert Miller, the owner and CEO of Miller Capital, a Wall Street investment firm. Soon enough into the movie, we learn that Miller has all kinds of business and relationships issues problems, and in fact each of these problems could've easily by themselves filled a whole movie: from the business side, it appears that Miller's firm is mysteriously short $412 million just at a time when the firm is about to be sold at a large profit. Miller borrows the funds to cover up the hole, but that puts only more pressure on him as the lender now wants the loan repaid. From the personal side, Miller is having an affair with Julie, a French up and coming art gallery owner. Late one night, as Miller and Julie are diving off, Miller nods off, causing the car to flip over and Julie is accidentally killed. Miller decides to flee the scene.At that point we're maybe 20 min. into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would truly ruin your viewing experience. The tension does not let up, as we watch and wonder (i) whether Miller can pull off the sale of his company despite all of the financial and accounting irregularities, and (ii) whether Miller will be able to get away with the accidental death of Julie. You'll just have to see it for yourself how it all plays out.Several commments: this is the first feature from writer director Nicholas Jarecki, and he shows a lot of talent and promise. At times the movie felt very Hitchcock like. Second, the acting performances are excellent throughout, but there are two I'd like point out: Richard Gere, of course, now at age 63 and in his best role since ""Unfaithful"" in 2002, and he is already being mentioned as a serious candidate for a Best Actor Oscar nomination; and also Brit Marling, who plays the Ivanka Trump reminding role of Miller's daughter and right hand person in the company. I saw her earlier this summer in the excellent indie movie ""Sound of My Voice"" (which she also co wrote and produced) and she is rapidly rising amoung the ranks of today's female actresses (except that she also directs, writes and produces!). Keep an eye out for her, as she is definitely going places. Meanwhile ""Arbitrage"" is a thoroughly entertaining financial and crime drama. The movie house where I saw this at today here in Cincinnati was PACKED, and as Bjork's ""I See Who You Are"" starting playing over the closing credits, there was an applause from the audience indicating its approval and then some. ""Arbitrage"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",4.5 stars... Entertaining thriller from start to finish,1347580800,"09 14, 2012",4,1
"Thoughtful and well written.Thought provoking.  Opportunities, choices, consequences. It's strange to think that the decisions  made before age 25, when we are all impaired with an undeveloped brain, directs the course of our adult  lives.

"Set somewhere between the movies TRON and TRON:LEGACY, TRON:UPRISING follows the adventures and misadventures of a program named Beck. During his fight with CLU, Tron was severely damaged and isn&#8217;t quite the same program he used to be. He needs time to heal, regroup, and build a resistance and ends up outside of one of the farthest outlying cities on the grid, Argon City. Meanwhile, after seeing a friend killed, Beck begins doing some civil disobedience after hours and eventually meets Tron. Tron agrees to not only allow Beck to use his name, but to actually take his image by using his disc. Tron then mentors and trains Beck in the hopes that he will be able to lead the revolution against CLU. Tron lives!Following styles used in TRON:LEGACY, TRON:UPRISING is a visually gorgeous panorama of neon colors. I think the series is worth watching just for the visuals alone.Of course, there&#8217;s much more to the series than that. Overall, the series is well developed. It does a good job of creating characters, providing backstories for those characters, and further developing those characters. Well, at least for the protagonists. Other than Paige, most of the antagonists are cardboard cut outs. There are a few episodes that suffer from repeat scenario syndrome (same scenario with slightly different villain), but these episodes are few. Most of the stories are really entertaining, especially for only being twenty two minutes long. There&#8217;s also a few surprises here and there along the way.Overall, TRON:UPRISING is a fairly entertaining animated series that both children and adults can appreciate. It has a lot of appeal to Tron fans, but is also something that a person who has never seen either of the two Tron movies can watch.",Tron Lives!,1391558400,"02 5, 2014",4,1

"Rubicon is a hard one to review. I'm not even sure to what the title refers. However, the series is compulsively watchable. Low key and thought provoking.There series starts with the suicide of a wealthy professorial type because he receives a four leaf clover. A few days later (or earlier) another rich guy had done the same. Neither suicide was at all suspected.Will (recently divorced but we see no influence of this)works for the API, a secret think tank that seems to analyze and organize intelligence data. Will is supervised by a man named David, with whom and with whose family, Will has a close relationship. David hints to Will that he may be on the scent of a conspiracy. He doesn't get to say more because he is killed when two commuter trains smash into each other head on. (Since David sits in the very first seat of his train, the collision makes his death pretty much a certainty.) Will, however, spots that David's car had been parked in spot 13 the day of the crash, and, since David was an intensely superstitious man, Will comes to believe that David's death was (no pun) engineered   the possible conspiracy somehow caused two trains to collide and did not cavil at 100's of deaths to off a man who was getting suspicious.Will gets David's old job. He pursues clues in newspaper crossword puzzles, going for help to a retired API guy who was is a whiz. More cryptic clues from David show up. Without getting too much further in the plot, things get to a point at which there is an attempt on Will's life   foiled, of course, by Will shooting the jazzailant   by one of the APA bigwigs, while Will gets help from another API bigwig, Kale.In the background, but often in the foreground, are Will's team of analysts, almost all of whom each have a problem. Kale helps them and makes a good macho gay hero. He doesn't have a problem, except, of course, for the fact that he cannot trust almost anyone around him. Good actor   pretty much everyone in the show is good, though a couple of Will's analysts are a bit over the top. We watch as the team tries to figure out the identity of a terrorist, does that and tracks him to the US where, presumably, he is going to do something very bad. In the past, information gleaned from API had been used to create disasters from which the group of conspirators had profited immensely.Will (James Badge Dale) is played very, very low key, but it is well done. The directing is good, and the visuals are ok, but nothing special.The are questions central to the show that haunt me. If David regarded Will as a son, why didn't he just talk to him? If Kale knows that Will is onto something and is willing to help Will, why doesn't he open up to Will? Why go to such great lengths to kill David? Why so shoddy an attempt on Will's life? Why are clues left in the lining of a jewelry box that might never be opened? Where do all the conspirators' spies and hit men come from?According to Amazon, there is only one more episode left in this season.

"Hannibal is an amazing show. I was skeptical at the beginning but I decided to take a risk on this show and I'm glad I did! If you're a fan of the Silence of the Lambs (and the Hannibal movie, of course) and the Red Dragon book, this show is for you! It's as good as the book and the movies.The cast is amazing, Mads Mikkelsen plays an amazing Hannibal Lecter, and Hugh Dancy is great too. The plot has a lot of mystery, gore, mindgames and crazy twists that any TV fan would love. If you haven't seen the movies or read the books, I would give it a try for any horror fan, or anyone who loves The Walking Dead, True Blood, The Vampire Diaries and other mystery supernatural shows, Hannibal will be the right new show for you.I hope this release includes the censored fourth episode, Ceuf (that many fans had to watch it illegaly because of NBC's weird decisions) and it would be the perfect release for any fan of this show.I can't wait to buy it, and NBC has to renew it for a second season, this show has to last a long time!",Best new show on TV in years!,1369180800,"05 22, 2013",5,1

"With the new medical thriller the Good Doctor, British star Orlando Bloom finally comes into his own as an actor of substance and a screen presence to be reckoned with. This represents something of a coming out party, playing the challenging role of Dr. Martin Blake, an unjazzuming man who wants to be good, but is for some unknown reason drawn towards an evil he just can't help. Bloom is perfectly suited for this role, playing the character appropriately low key, as unjazzuming, calm and is totally convincing. Bloom, has been an actor that has impressed me little with his career choices, but I have always suspected that there was more to him than what we were getting in movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End.Dr. Blake on the surface appears as a kind, friendly, outgoing young doctor who's just arriving at his new post in an American hospital under the supervision of Dr. Waylan (Rob Morrow). However, he quickly has a clash with an outspoken Nurse (Taraji P. Henson) over mistreatment of a patient who doesn`t speak english. He also develops an unsavory fascination with a teenage patient, Diane Nixon (Riley Keough), he soon finds himself tampering with her treatment as to keep her in the hospital, thus keeping her close to him.It's easy to believe that only healthy people would find medical dramas enjoyable,  being a less than healthy person myself having recently spent a spell in a hospital, I haven't ever cared much for the genre in the past, there have also been few great films in of this variety. So I wasn't expecting to actually enjoy this film, I shouldn't have doubted, director Lance Daly has made one of the best, smartest and most sophisticated thrillers in a long while. This is a gem that will appeal to aficionados of cljazzic suspenseful stories especially those from France, recent films such as Tell No One, but also the filmography of noted new waver maestro Claude Chabrol. There is also a touch of the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock, present.At a taunt ninety minutes, the Good Doctor is successful in building suspense and a mounting fear of dread. It is not overt, it never descends into graphicness or sensationalism. It allows the audience to wallow in uncomfortable feelings, especially since Dr. Blake is the central protagonist, he's likeable, full of charisma and we find ourselves rooting for him while despising his actions. Blake is a character similar to that of Tom Ripley.None of this would work without the performance of Bloom, which I can't praise high enough, perhaps because of my surprise with it, but also because it is so good. Bloom has too often been dismissed as just a pretty face, but I think his detractors will be quite astounded with his work here. Aided by a strong supporting cast, especially Riley Keough, daughter of Lisa Marie Presley (yes, Elvis' grandbaby!), playing the key role of the object of Dr. Blake's unhealthy obsession. Keough is an actress that I haven't seen much of before, but clearly has the goods to be a future presence in films, she has some interesting stuff in the works.The other pivotal performance comes from the wonderful character actor Michael Pena, soon to be seen in a leading role in End of Watch. Playing Jimmy, an insalubrious orderly who has a run in with the good doctor that leads first leads to animosity, then blackmail and other unsavory deeds. Pena gives the counter performance to Bloom's leading antagonistic hero, crucial in his delivery, Pena goes to show he can stand with the best supporting players working today or any time for that matter. Speaking of the best of supporting players, J.K. Simmons, always a welcome screen presence has a brief, but nicely done cameo as a police detective, here.Not a movie to be easily dismissed or should it be overlooked. Far too many contemporary thrillers are just big, dumb excuses for chases and the eventually duel between hero and villain. The Good Doctor is cut from a different cloth, it is a subtle, deliberately paced, but a very rewarding film. One of the year's very best movies, this is one you'll regret if should neglect to see it.check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",Excellent thinking person's thriller,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",5,1

"I decided to buy this based on the good reviews and the fact that Guillermo del Toro  one of my very fave directors, and the director of my fave ghost story  The Devil's Backbone  produced this.Well, no disappointment here. Not in any part. The acting, the direction, the scenery, the set design, the script, the music, the ending  it all worked together, all paid off.This starts off slowly, gently. But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large, mansion style orphanage  the shadows, the direction, the way the action of an innocent game is set up  perfectly sets the tone of the film. It's nostalgic, but it's also slightly creepy. It foreshadows a lot. Pay attention.Zoom years later. One of those children who'd been playing in the yard, the girl Laura, is now grown with a son. We find out the main characters  mother Laura, father, son Simon  have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children. Simon, himself, is  a special needs child: He has HIV.Soon, the game of ""invisible friends"" takes on an ominous reality. And every scene builds tension, builds, builds, until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question  of the lead and of the viewer  how far will a mother, this mother, go to find her missing son?While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on (the clues are all there, and the script does not cheat), it's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work. Almost all is fairly foreshadowed, but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I cannot describe how beautiful the finale  the climactic moment   is. Tragedy, sorrow, redemption and beauty all coalesce. It is a miraculous cooperation of acting direction storytelling setting lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely, too, leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings, mortal beings, and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed  that's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes, this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily, and the scares are surely present, but it is not a gore show. It is a more human and artistic ghost story, and is in fact MORE than a ghost story. It's a story of family and friendship, and of a mother who will not give up, because the deepest love outlives the grave, even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film. Magnificent. (And pay very close attention to EVERYTHING, for all the strings come together in the end.)Mir",A ghost story/family story/mystery that builds and builds to a finale of astonishing beauty,1228867200,"12 10, 2008",5,1

"I was VERY impressed with the way this movie plays out.  I remember seeing it on the Horror Blogs sites and not giving it much attention, but the other day, I finally decided to give it a go.  Boy am I glad I did!  The ONLY complaint I have with the movie is Kether Donohue's acting during her video ""outing"" the whole situation.  Her acting during the actual event was REALLY good, but it seems during the one on one footage that she was a little less sure of herself.  I don't know,...I'm no film expert, so maybe I'm thinking too much into it.  Regardless, if you like the ""found footage"" genre, then you simply MUST watch this movie.  If they had put in out into the media as a publicity stunt and ""leaked"" some of the footage, I believe this would have gone out as a mjazzive scare.  It one of those movies that makes you think it's something that could actually happen!  The subject matter is part of the reason why I'm not a fan of swimming in lakes and ponds or any other natural body of water.  You never know what's in there!The movie begins with Donna (Kether Donohue) making a video to tell the world what actually happened on July 4, 2009 in her small town of Maryland.  The movie follows Donna as she is making her video and playing discussing the footage that has since surfaced after the whole ordeal.  During the town's Fourth of July festivities, people begin to become ill from what they think is some type of virus.  This leads to chaos erupting amongst the towns citizens and leaders and eventually becomes a matter of national security.The movie is played out mostly through the newscast that Donna works for.  It's her first time in the field and she's suddenly stumbled into the story of the century.  Throughout the movie, we see clips of homemade footage shot by other locals and town leaders.  The fact that most of it is newsfeed makes it FAR more watchable then most ""found footage"" movies out.  In my opinion, at least.Everyone needs to watch this movies.  Whether you're a ""horror"" fan or not.  It's just a really interesting movie.","Very entertaining ""found footage"" flick!",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",5,1

"First met this show in an online preview of Episode One at a nameless competitor. Since I grew up 20 miles from Lunenburg the filming location for this show the hair stood up on the back of my head the moment I started watching it. The views of the harbour are cljazzic and the aerial shots give a whole new perspective on a town I know and love. Camped in Lunenburg this summer up the street from where the Bluenose II is being rebuilt and walked the harbour where Duke's boat lies docked with a for sale sign. Town Hall subs as the police station.Those personal attachments aside the series employs great Canadian actors the two male leads being standouts. Anyone who has gone down to the sea in ships knows that superstition and faith take over when man loses control and despite the most advanced technology man is still powerless to control the sea. Half million ton ships still plow straight into rogue waves off the Cape of Good Hope and vanish forever. Ships like the Mary Celeste show up sailing themselves with crews that vanished without a trace. Among people who try to make sense of the inexplicable ghosts and hauntings are commonplace. Some of the storylines here begin to strain suspension of disbelief but on the whole are not too far removed from reality. The episode in Season 2 based on the plagues of Egypt taken from Exodus is a case in point. Highly recommended. If it succeeds this show should do wonders for tourism in a World Heritage Community.

"I continue to be amazed at how much I love ""Battlestar Galactica."" I usually don't enjoy science fiction, but this show is unlike any other sci fi series I've seen before. In fact, ""BSG"" just may be my favorite television show of all time, which says a lot!Season Three of ""BSG"" picks up right where Season Two left off. The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves. Unfortunately, the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down. After invading New Caprica, the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them. Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation. Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan, which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded. Obviously, the Adamas and their small crew can't just abandon the rest of humanity, and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.I don't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet. However, there's a lot that goes on in Season Three, especially where Tyrol, Tigh, Tory, Anders, and Starbuck are concerned. If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking, just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three!There are a few small issues I have with this season. First of all, I think there are too many ""one shot episodes"" that don't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all. Having a few episodes like that is fine, but I think there were an abundance of them this time around. Also, I'm not sure how I feel about the way certain music served as a major revelation during the season finale. Hopefully Season Four will do a good job of explaining things.Overall, though, this was a great season. I'm very sad that there's only one more season left, but I can't wait for it to start up again in March.",Frackin' amazing television!,1199750400,"01 8, 2008",5,1

"Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano made a name for himself with idiosyncratic crime dramas about the Yakuza, characterized by long static shots, creative editing, bursts of graphic violence, and deadpan humor. Though Kitano has since expanded his oeuvre to include comedies and art films, his latest export, Outrage, finds him returning to his roots, chronicling a Yakuza power struggle during a time of societal transition. After a handful of creative departures over the past decade, Kitano stated that he intended Outrage purely to be entertaining, and he succeeded. Screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2010, and it's already got a sequel slated for this year.

"Bryan Cranston is absolutely amazing as Walter White, a loving family man stricken with terminal cancer. In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family, the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter. His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be? Add in Walter's streetwise brother in law who is a DEA agent, and there is quite a story here.Jesse, the low level drug dealer, and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder. Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad. Meth dealers as heroes of a show? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the ""bad"" guys in this scenario   not the addicted buyers of the meth.Be ready for a high level of violence. Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers. A simple idea to make money becomes a life threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter's life. The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels.

"Daisy (Saoirse Ronan) &#34;don't call me Elizabeth&#34; has Daddy issues and comes to vacation in the country side of England with relatives she has never met. She takes meds for the voices in her head and is a disagreeable individual who hates everything about the country except for a young man named Eddie (George MacKay) a cow whisperer. Europe is in turmoil, events we know little about. When a nuclear device is exploded in London, fallout comes to the farm (literally and figuratively) as Daisy opts to refuse pjazzage to safety to stay in her newly acquired comfort zone.The film centers around Daisy and the choices she makes for her new family, going from a self centered individual, finally learning about loving a family, something she has missed since the death of her mother. &#34;WWIII&#34; provides the background and was more of a distraction to the film than anything else. Saoirse Ronan, a NYC girl who has also lived in Ireland was a natural for the part.This is another series of films that were well made, but I didn't find having an overwhelming amount of entertainment value. Even with the dropping of an atomic bomb and armies roaming the countryside, I was still in the mode of waiting for something to happen besides the growing of Daisy's character.

"When I first took a look at the DVD cover picture of this movie and a few quotes on it, I just jazzumed this was a comedy or even a romantic comedy type when I rented it. It is not.  It is a very heartfelt and poignant story of how dissimilar lives collide on several levels and then all work their way together.  Only, not right away.  Written and directed by Ted Koland, this entire story really isn't completely understood until more toward the end. And for myself, it is an emotional film at times, with the ending being even more so which was worth the view.The movie begins with the wedding reception of Kristin (Jessica Weixler) and Scott (Justin Long).  Scott's Best Man and friend that he really does not see often enough, Lumpy (Tyler Labine), gets way overboard with his drinking. Before he is convinced that he needs to go to his room and sleep this off, he demands that Scott takes an envelope of cash forgetting to purchase a wedding gift.  While in his room, he is acting up, jumping on the bed in a drunken state, falling and hitting his head dangerously hard.  He then unfortunately locks himself out of the building and collapses out on the hotel grounds ... Dead.  This, of course, throws the newly married couple into a panic over the death of a friend and the definite change of Honeymoon plans.  They must use that Honeymoon money to ship the body back to Minneapolis, Minnesota for his funeral and subsequent burial. To say the least, the across the country ride there is tense and unhappy as they are supposed to be under palm trees and sipping drinks wearing Caftans.  Now they are driving to northern Minnesota to tell his young friend, Ramsey, what they have discovered about his death and subsequent upcoming funeral.The movie jumps backwards quite a few years to a freezing cold Minnesota winter in a time past, while Lumpy was alive and how these two unlikely people met. She saved his life at one point.  He had a sweet, platonic and lovely relationship with a neglected teenager, Ramsey (Addison Timlin). Her mother, Jaime (Frances O'Conner), experiments with drugs, men and moving around from place to place constantly. She does appear to love Ramsey, though.  If this sort of behavior is proof of loving a fifteen year old child.  Lumpy and Ramsey have been the best of friends for many years.  He came to visit her each weekend, he had someone that truly loved him as much as he adored her.  Now the couple has come to let Ramsey know the tragedy of, ""The only person she ever cared about"".By the ending of the movie I was in tears. Ramsey surprised me.  Lumpy's mother had something up her sleeve. The money that Lumpy ended up giving to Scott at the wedding had a wonderful purpose. Sometimes, just sometimes, things quizzically come together that you would never expect.  This movie was definitely worth the ride for me and one I wouldn't have ever guessed from the beginning.","""No, I'm Serious, I Didn't Get You A Wedding Gift.

"""Mutant Chronicles""(2009)                                        NOTE: mild spoilers below                                        This dystopian, post apocalyptic, alternate future world action flick has a familiar feel... Indeed, much of the film is taken up with self parody, gently poking fun at the genre in much the same way that 2004's ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" lampooned the old action serials of the 1930s.  The story is set in a grimy, steampunkish world where the First World War is still being fought in the trenches and corporations rule entire continents. The endless war is interrupted when the combatants unknowingly uncork a mystic seal that held in check the mutant hordes from a distant planet, imprisoned there millennia ago by a religious order that is now run by the ever lispy John Malkovitch. As the mutants mjazzacre and multiply, it quickly becomes clear that Earth is doomed and an evacuation is planned. Malkovitch's high priest knows the secrets of the mutant horde and taps Ron Perlman (star of ""Hell Boy"") to recruit an elite squad for a military suicide mission to put the genies back in the bottle. The mismatched, misanthropic anti team has been seen a bazillion times before (Aliens, Predator, et al) but the film's producers are conscious of their cliches, and take advantage of the situation to pause for some kitschy, campy joke shots    overly heroic poses and obligatorily grim, determined speeches.  They know fans are just tapping their fingers waiting for the action to start, so you might as well have a little fun with the formula, in a Sam Raimi like way.The action really kicks in during the film's second half, and then the pace becomes relentless. ""Mutant Chronicles"" is not a tremendously innovative or imaginative movie, but fans will be pleased with this high octane sci fi creature feature splatterfest.  Besides, any film where we get to see John Malkovitch get torn apart by demons is fine by me.  I'd give it a 3.5.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)","Arrrrrgh...!!

"  Veronica (investigating Piz's car, from which his moving in stuff had been stolen): ""It doesn't look like they jimmied their way in.""  Piz: ""It wasn't locked.""  Veronica: ""College campus. All your worldly possessions. Where are you from? Brigadoon?""Nope, Neptune in Cali isn't exactly as  magical as Brigadoon. Neptune, like most places, hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents, which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency, staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19 year old daughter Veronica. So for this 3rd and final season, we again say hello   and bid farewell   to these folks up in Neptune. With high school flush in her rearview mirror, part time shamus, now full time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College. But some things simply don't change for our feisty heroine. She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend, Logan Echolls. And she still touts a rep for ferreting out, and digging in, and nosing about. And, since she does get results, she's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS   THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good, but it's the weakest of the three seasons. This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder. On a smaller scale, her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook, some missing tapes, an accusation of plagiarism, a vanished heiress, a secret society, a holdup at a costume casino party, etc. So add that to her freshman woes. And, being Veronica Mars, she also doesn't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity, as well as the weasely jazzistant of her criminology professor. But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper. And she's always got her buds to lean on, Wallace, Mac, and Logan, even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic (just one reason this season isn't as good).But the show's not all about Veronica (it's just mostly about Veronica). My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars, and he has his own messes to muddle thru. Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations; Weevil is now out on parole (from his misdeeds in Season 2) but must maintain a job; and Mac, well, she's still shy. Meanwhile, Veronica's clique widens in the forms of the happy go lucky, kinda dull Piz (Wallace's roomie) and party girl, kinda dull Parker (Mac's roomie). So, hello, new loves and old loves, and there's even a hasty wedding. As usual, it's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises. Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes (plus extras) in one sleep deprived   but worth it   marathon viewing session. Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television, the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more. Having said that, not only am I bummed out about the series's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there wasn't even a proper ending to the series. Again, only 20 episodes here, with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff. Not cool, CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff, which can be found on the 6th disc (there are 6 discs in all in this set). Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4: one's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would've been like (Veronica in the FBI), the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show. Both segments, to me, feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff (ie: the town of Neptune, the school backdrop, Veronica's father and circle of friends) had been taken away. A whole new mess of characters are introduced, all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner ""Going Undercover with Rob Thomas"" (and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge) we get 9 ho hum featurettes: ""Main Titles: Why the Change?""; ""Rob's Directing Experience""; ""Favorite Guest Star Moments""; ""Veronica Mars: Mean Girl""   in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3; ""The Politics of Veronica Mars""   concerning the negative reactions to the show; Thomas goes over his ""Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments"" and his ""Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments""; ""Do Overs?""   scenes of which Thomas wasn't too fond; and ""Highlights""   more of Thomas's fave moments. Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas's intros; a 7 minute gag reel (best was Enrico Colantoni's many takes of ""I finally got the police report on the ****'s suicide""). The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips, the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A ing each other. There's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes. A ton of extras here, so I shouldn't gripe; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods, consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny, with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist. Once in a while, my thoughts were even provoked. Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter, the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi faceted mysteries which perplexed. But by this season's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern, that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline. The last five episodes instead tended to be self contained ones, and that's when the show really began to feel fractured. There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons, although most of the episodes are still darn watchable. If I had to pick favorites, three episodes instantly spring to mind: ""Debasement Tapes,"" in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled, near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory; ""Postgame Mortem,"" in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11 year old girl; and episode 20, which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department, Jason Dohring (the ever moody Logan) again stands out. Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe. My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter dad thing. There's just this amazing level of understanding, caring, and humor between them, and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni. Whenever they're in a scene together, the world is good. And, as always, Kristen Bell, playing that spunky, tenacious girl detective, effortlessly carries the show.But, well, the show's done now, and the superb cast scattered, with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring, to MOONLIGHT. But it's still gonna take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain: ""A long time ago, we used to be friends."" VERONICA MARS, you see, it was a very good show. And, to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica, ""I find her nosiness charming.""","""Anyone ever tell you you look like a feisty young Barbara Eden?""",1195603200,"11 21, 2007",4,1

"Since the season of DOWNTON ABBEY is over for the year it is refreshing to come upon an intelligent new series that is fresh, fascinating,  well acted and takes a new stance on not only law enforcement but character development and the more serious questions of what happens to the person left behind after a tragic accident.After a car accident takes the life of a family member, police detective Michael Britten (Jason Issacs) lives two alternating parallel lives, one with his wife (Laura Allen) and one with his son Rex (Dylan Minnette). Is one of his ""realities"" merely a dream? These are the dilemmas Michael faces with the help of his two psychiatrists   BD Wong and Cherry Jones   and each psychiatrist deals with the family member Michael is convinced is still alive.  What is reality, what is dream, what is the effect of grieving?Writer Kyle Killen works this conundrum along with Michael's function as a detective   partnered with detective `Bird' (Steve Harris) and detective rookie Efrem (Wilmer Valderrama)   and as they investigate murders episodes from Michael's strangely bifurcated lives add additional mystery.It will be interesting to see how this storyline develops: nothing is obvious from this first episode except that for an opening story, this one shows great promise.

"""Only God Forgives"" immediately developed a reputation for being the sequel to ""Drive"" once the first trailer started making the rounds due to director Nicolas Winding Refn being reunited with actor Ryan Gosling. That violent powerhouse mentality that you've come to expect from Nicolas Winding Refn's work is undoubtedly there, which is what you would expect after watching a film like ""Bronson,"" but ""Only God Forgives"" is actually more similar to ""Valhalla Rising"" than any other of Nicolas Winding Refn's works since it's very abstract yet still mesmerizing.Like ""Drive,"" Ryan Gosling doesn't speak much. The Canadian actor doesn't even have two dozen lines. The emphasis on Thai boxing is fascinating thanks to the extreme contrast in lighting throughout the film. There's a heavy use of deep reds, blacks, some of the most intricate wallpaper you'll ever see, and characters hiding in the shadows. Blue fluorescent lighting seems to attempt to fool you as it only helps illustrate the calm before the storm.""Only God Forgives"" relies on senses to bring its storytelling to life, which in part is to blame for the film's chimera like atmosphere. Nearly every character wears loud shoes that echo in alleyways, eyes are accentuated and are the only body part visible while everything else is hidden in shadow, and then you see Julian get his arm chopped off as his female companion Mai (Yayaying Rhatha Phongam) pleasures herself as he watches or sees blood appear in his hands while he has them in the sink but is noticeably fine in the next shot. At times, you can't get a clear read on whether Julian is hallucinating or if the events are actually happening. He always has this blank stare on his face and seems to be distracted by the simplest tasks.Wandering shots of certain characters strolling down the street at night or practicing their sword technique by the lake during the day are fantastic thanks to the incredible soundtrack by Cliff Martinez. Unnerving at times, soothing at others, and completely keyboard inspired in between, Martinez may have topped the music he did for ""Drive"" with his work on ""Only God Forgives."" The camera has a love affair with Julian's hands. We are constantly seeing his hands from the wrist down as he makes fists in the dark or prepares to fight.Ryan Gosling's silence is more than made up for by Kristin Scott Thomas' lack of conscience. Crystal wants vengeance for her son's death and will stop at nothing to achieve that goal. She is crude, bitter, and her cold hearted demeanor absolutely makes her the most entertaining character on screen whenever she opens her mouth.""Only God Forgives"" is a bizarre crime thriller that is slow building, intensely crafted, and riveting. Like you've come to expect from Nicolas Winding Refn, its brutality knocks you to the ground like a frying pan to the skull.",Time to meet the devil,1374192000,"07 19, 2013",4,1
"You know what's going to happen. You know Jack is going to bust chops, break legs, get thrown off cars, fall of buildings, lie to people, tell the truth to people, (where important), put himself in danger, put others in danger, pull head fakes, juke, jump of low bridges, pretend to be docile then smash someone in the head, shoot wildly with incredible accuracy, but.. hey. It's Jack. It's what he does. What is interesting and this is where credit goes to the writing team and the directorial team in creating what various television shows across the spectrum attempt, but rarely achieve. That would be, to put the protagonist and therefore the plot in such a state of peril, based on real world logic, (no magic rabbits here, for the most part...) that the entire plot dances like a grease bubble in the center of a very hot frying pan, oscillating perhaps a degree here, or there, but for the most part fulminating like liquid mercury on a hot plate. Hiss! Sizzle! Bubble! Which is not easy. You really have to be a strict disciplinarian, 'no he cant' say to himself, &#34;she must have gone that way, because it was a red door,&#34; or some other dubious form of plot device, in order to move things forward.One other way this show, perhaps as effectively as any other show out there, uses modern media as a powerful agent in propelling narrative movement. That element keeps the the hot point front and center, as the viewer's mind races to anticipate what could possibly be the next move Jack might make.Have we seen it all before? Sure we have. Yet the new season employs the gears of drama as consummately as any single episode before it, so far, with familiar villains, deceitful faces and failed opportunities to help us remember that life itself is one big chance to get it right. I hope the show can keep it up.","Yeah, it's standard 24, But",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",5,1

T Bag's twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home, but he doesn't face reality.

"Let's begin with the basics: this is not a literal ""how to"" guide. The intentionally provocative title is meant as satire, and is an attempt to package polemic in a form that will attract an audience not normally disposed to watching serious documentaries. All this the director quite openly admits in the commentary.Will his approach achieve that aim? Honestly, I doubt it. It's hard to see this film attracting anything other than the standard audience for left leaning films that bridge the gap between activism and journalism. Not least of all because beyond a certain point all pretense at instructing the viewer in the film's ostensive subject is dropped: the director just concentrates on pitching us his message. As a result, in its presentation at least, this film is about as convincing as a middle aged vicar who's decided that he's going to rap to the local teenagers about Jesus.Word to your virgin mother.Or perhaps I should just say ""Keep it real, yo"". Although I am reliably informed that rappers don't say that anymore either.None of which means that underlying all this, there isn't a good documentary. Actually, there rather is. Once you get past its utterly unconvincing attempts to wrap itself in a kind ofGrand Theft Autostreet cool, you'll find an intelligent, well researched film with important things to say. Although its underlying message is far from new, and has in fact been quite admirably summed up by Homer Simpson:""Prohibition? They tried that in the movies and it didn't work.""To its credit, this film does do a devastating job of laying bare the real human cost of prohibition and the war on drugs. Of a ""justice system"" beholden to nothing more than maintaining the status quo and all its subsidiary interests: commercial, political, and bureaucratic. A system that, as a result, is now ruining lives on an industrial scale.Throughout much of the earlier part of the film, the part that really did deal with the escapades of various entry level drug dealers on their journey through the ranks, I found myself laughing and chuckling away many times   nihilistic SOB that I am.But after the justice system got involved, even I could no longer laugh.And that, of course, is the real point of this movie.Theo.","""it does not matter if the war is not real, or when it is, that victory is not possible""",1391731200,"02 7, 2014",4,1

"I'm no parent, and I've never been all that interested in visited Mexico or the greater Caribbean; but if COME OUT AND PLAY is any indication, then maybe I've made some pretty wise choices in my life.  From what I've been told, kids can be such a handful   always wanting this, always wanting that, a constant source of fun and frustration.  When they're young, they can't care for themselves, can't much fend for themselves.  The kids of COME OUT AND PLAY, though, are all doing just fine on their own.  They're doing better than fine.  They're behaving downright felonious.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come', then read on ...)Beth (played by Vinessa Shaw) and Francis (Ebon Moss Bachrach) are vacationing in Mexico, trying to squeeze in some quality `lovebird' time before the arrival of their third child.  Down the coast, there's an even more idyllic spot, and Francis finagles a boat from a local resident so that they can spirit themselves to the coastal paradise.  Once they get there, they find the place mostly deserted, though there are a few children playing on the docks, in the streets, and on the beach.  What starts out as a casual `escape' turns into a struggle for survival against curiously mounting odds as they discover that these children are nothing short of bloody murderers!An Official Selection of the Toronto International Film Festival, COME OUT AND PLAY will likely give vacationing parents nightmares that'll keep them awake forever.  There isn't much to say about a horror film of this nature, and that's because the cinematic `slight of hand' is all up on display in the presentation.  Elusive director Makinov (Google him if you want to know the real story) directs from a script adapted from a `cult' novel by Juan Jose Plans.  For my tastes, it reminds me so much of what Alfred Hitchcock used to accomplish in film: present a very real world scenario, and then turn it all on its head.Like in THE BIRDS, our `heroes' seek out and find a tranquil place to enjoy a holiday, but that tranquility begins to fade away as they continue to question their surroundings.  It doesn't take long before their questions turn into suspicions.  Witnessing a full blown jazzault puts them back on their heels, and then seeing a murder take place puts them on the run.  Like the audience, they don't want to believe this is possible   they don't even much stop to hypothesize how it all may've gone wrong   but that's because they're trapped in this terror they didn't create, and there's no way out.The performances are all solid (for these circumstances), and the setting is scarily perfect.  Granted, the `science' of it all doesn't much get explained, but that's because to do so would remove the `magic' element of the story.  With some horror films, you're never meant to look too closely   you're not supposed to know just how it all came to be   you're only destined to sit back and enjoy the ride.Or not.COME OUT AND PLAY is produced by Canana Films and Videocine S.A. de C.V.  DVD distribution is being handled by Cinedigm, a New Video company.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds about as well as any other horror release I've seen in the last few years.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is an English language picture but there are sections of the film that are heavily spoken in Spanish and even a few other broken languages.  As for the special features, there's a behind the scenes short along with some cast interviews and some deleted scenes   it's a nice jazzortment if this is your deal (which is to say that you like unconventional horror flicks that may not survive too much close scrutiny).HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  I can appreciate a good horror flick as much as the next person, and COME OUT AND PLAY certainly fits the bill.  It certainly raises enough questions that go unanswered to turn some viewers off, but there's a healthy (or is that unhealthy?) atmosphere of consistently mounting dread for our two protagonists in much the same way Alfred Hitchcock constructed in his seminal THE BIRDS only, this time, it ain't birds you have to watch out for: it's the children.  Watch out for the children.  Let's do it for the children.  Who'd a thunk those them there kids would be so ungrateful?In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD copy of COME OUT AND PLAY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","When Children Of The Corn Meet Lord of the Flies, They All COME OUT AND PLAY",1371513600,"06 18, 2013",4,1
This is a good show that I enjoyed watching.  The scenery is awesome and the characters are interesting.

"I have watched the first three episodes of DOMINION. I already love this show and hope it will last because I will be engaged as long as it will be on. The special effects are stunning, even the raven looking wings look real, like they belong on the humans that are acting. It's worth watching this show just for special effects. Actually I was delighted to see a familiar face in Roxanne Mackee from game of Thrones in Dominion.The show it self seems promising, it brings about the struggle of good and evil, a trait we all have in us, wether we like to admit it or not. I wasn't so sure after the pilot, but now I can see that this show could be a winner. A show starts with a story and in my opinion it's very well written. I really like the the concept of Angels as arch types in a show. We seem to have forgotten them. Gabriel has chosen to be an enemy of Humanity whereas Michael has chosen to join them. There is no mention yet where the other arch angels, but altogether there are seven of them; Gabriel, Michael, Raphael, Uriel, Raguel, Remiel and Saraqael.Uriel comes on the scene in the third episode and is a woman. She is using trickery on both of her brothers, Michael and Gabriel. Uriel is a face of God and when Michael complains about theit Heavenly Father abandoning their children, she answers: he never left. Uriel is the bringer of light and is the Archangel most connected with earth. It will be interesting to see how things play out with Alex the chosen one. But what if God abandoned us all?I think it's interesting in a conversation between Michael and Gabriel that God allegedly questioned himself and his creation and is disappointed in humanity who is turning our planet into a garbage pit. It certainly makes us think that maybe we should queston our selfs, since it might be possible for God. It gives us something to think about, like how really bad our stewardship is we have been trusted with on this earth. It gives an opportunity to think how wrong we are about many things and what we could do right.",Dominion is holding my attention. It got me thinking.,1404345600,"07 3, 2014",5,1
"This series manages to expose parts of all our issues, faults, character that require resolution.

"in the early 1960's, Someone animation studio  took the idea of moving stilled comicbook images with slight motion (an arm, a leg),  voice, sound and special effect using Marvel comics. This  Marvel animated comic was before 1966 Superman (The New Adventures of Superman   (DC Comics Cljazzic Collection)and  1967 Spiderman cartoon (Spider Man   The '67 Collection (6 Volume Animated Set)). THis version of the Graphic Novel of the Watchmen is similar to the old Marvel comic animation.For those fans of the graphic novels, this five and a half hour two disk DVD is like an audio book with pictures. This is NOT a kid's comic, I suggest a PG 13 to an R rating, if you were to put a rating on it. This is an adult graphic novel with sexually and slight nudity.The Powers that be on Warners could get rid of the pictures and release this as an audio book presentation with ease. What amazes me is the text and the graphics still hold up in this stilted animation. Nevertheless some of the animated effects on the DVD seems cheesy at times, like the rain effects and the walking effects.This acts like a graphic novel without frames.The only problem this has is the comic balloons that pop up on the screen, it takes away from the images since the vocals are the same as the balloon . It makes it less like a motion graphic novel, than a comicbook made for video. If I wanted to read, I would have picked up the graphic novel and read it.Voice artist Tom Stechshute sounds vocally a little like an younger Ed Asner. I would have hoped that this graphic novel should had a multi cast radio style production, rather than one voice. Stechshute seems weak when he does the female voices, but he does try.  He does a good job under the Vocal direction of Kelly Ward. However the power that be should have spent the money and gotten voiice casting and director Andrea Romano (who has done everything for Warner Animation  from Batman the Animated Series,  Scooby doo to the latest DC animated DVD featureWonder Woman 2009 (Two Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)).If you are a fan of the graphic novel, This DVD version is a great edition to a comic collection. It is an interesting concept, love to see them explore it with other graphic novels like MausThe Complete Maus: A Survivor's Tale (No 1)and ElfquestElfquest Archives Vol. 1.

"The month of October in 2002 was an understandably difficult time for the residents of Washington D.C., Maryland, and Virginia   not to mention the United States as a whole.  For those that don't recall, this was the time when John Allen Muhammad and his apparent patsy, Lee Boyd Malvo, went on a killing spree in what is now referred to as the ""Beltway snapper attacks.""  Over a three week span, ten people were murdered, while three more were injured as innocent people were struck down by sniper bullets, seemingly without pattern or motive.  Initially, these attacks were thought to have been carried out by jazzailants using a white van, but it was eventually uncovered that Malvo and Muhammad were using the now infamous blue Chevy Caprice.  The new film, Blue Caprice, attempts to chronicle the psychological driving force behind the killings.Alexandre Moors makes his feature length directorial debut with Blue Caprice, starring Isaiah Washington as John Allen Muhammad and Tequan Richmond as the young Lee Boyd Malvo.  After being abandoned by his mother, the impressionable Malvo meets Muhammad while Muhammad is vacationing with his kids in the Caribbean.  Flash forward several months   Muhammad leads Malvo to the United States, acting as his father figure.  Fueled by anger after his wife takes his children from him, Muhammad plots against the ""system"" by forcing (or encouraging) Malvo to maniacally act on his behalf. The pair travels the United States in a blue Caprice, carrying out random murders, thrusting the country into a state of fear and disarray.  Joey Lauren Adams and Tim Blake Nelson also star in supporting roles.To be certain, Blue Caprice is a chilling, uncomfortable film that chronicles a cryptic series of events.  In all honesty, this is one of those films that doesn't sit well and is more bothersome to witness than anything else.  It almost feels like true stories of this nature should never be used as a means of ""entertainment.""  Films, like Summer of Sam and Zodiac, contain admirable filmmaking contributions, yet they always create an undeniable sense of tenseness during the viewing process.  It's not like the Caprice killings took place 20 years ago.  They are only 11 years old (taking place just a year and change after 9 11), and even more bothersome is the fact that senseless acts of killing have become a norm in the United States, especially with tragic events like the Washington Navy yard, Sandy Hook Elementary, and Aurora movie theater shootings, all looming large.  Will those events turn into movies one day, too?  We should all shudder to think.  For recent tragedies to be depicted on film so soon after the actual events is unnerving, mostly because it appears as though others are cashing in on the events.  It just feels wrong.Aside from the slight objection of this film's subject matter, Blue Caprice features two masterfully acted performances by both Isaiah Washington and Tequan Richmond.  It's not very often that the main cast members of a film are both alarmingly bothersome and absolutely perfect for their roles all at the same time.  Washington leads the way as the cold, calculating manipulator with serious anger and acceptance issues.  He channels his rage to his ""adoptive"" son, portrayed by Richmond   a role that requires very little dialogue, as Richmond does his talking with his eyes and actions.  While Washington and Richmond steal the show, Joey Lauren Adams and Time Blake Nelson are also vital additions to this film, both leaving their fingerprints on their own respective characters   portraying the welcoming friends of the murders.For his first outing, it's brutally apparent that director (and screen writer) Alexandre Moors has a great deal of potential for future projects.  He's nothing short of superb, easily putting to rest any sort of speculation that he might have a subpar first endeavor.  He comes across with a clear vision for the film's characters, focusing on the emotional motivations as opposed to worrying about sticking to a typical historical rundown of events.  He doesn't spend too much time on one specific scene, and quickly gets the point of the scenes across without delay or over extension.  As the film winds down, Moors uses a gripping and mind bending montage of the random killings as opposed to spending an excessive amount of time on one incident over the other.  With such an impressive directorial debut, it's impossible not to look forward to his next picture.Overall, Blue Caprice is a film with a difficult subject matter.  At the same time, it's a film with far too many good things going for it to let a beef about the story hold it down.  On the other hand, this is not a typical date night flick, nor is it a film for the casual moviegoer.  This is a film depicting a trying subject matter, portrayed in a masterful, all be it chilling manner.  This low budget, under the radar film will likely go down as more of a critical delight, as opposed to something the mjazzes would enjoy.  There's really no recommendation to be had here unless you're a lover of slow developing, high reward films with no name actors that will never fully receive the accolades they deserve.GRADE:  B+FNDNreview.com","'Blue Caprice' cold, calculating",1379635200,"09 20, 2013",4,1

"None of the movie was a surprise but a simple depiction of tragedy. The film simply set up the scene, the basics of character, a tragic event to propel the movie There were tons of subplots hinted at and it could easily have gone off course, but it didn't.  I thought it was interesting that the film maker made the choice to remind us that everyone has their own baggage in any situation, but that doesn't  change the main focus. It really made me think about how quickly the most innocent choice could go wrong so quickly.  A bad choice could  turn even quicker and children are so quick after they learn to walk!  the town sentiments were complex and mixed in with their own personal issues, but it seemed to be a divide between those that had children and those that didn't, but there is plenty of room for differing opinions.

"Ah, the British! They have their eccentricities that have been providing fodder for little films for years   from the great stories of EM Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Julian Fellowes et al to the little dramadies such as this one written by director Donald Rice with Mary Henely Magill, CHEERFUL WEATHER FOR THE WEDDING. They come off best when the odd cljazz oriented families take themselves seriously, covering their narrow view of the world of civility with accents so thick and rapidly delivered that without subtitles it is difficult to follow the script! But they are enchanting, especially when delivered by a cast of superb actors who are able to enter these odd characters' psyches and make us titter while we endure their snobbishness.This film is meticulously presented and is both a celebration of English eccentricity and an understated examination of how families often do everything they can to avoid saying how they really feel. Dolly Thatcham (Felicity Jones) is to be married to the wealthy Owen (James Norton) after a very brief engagement: Dolly delays her preparations for the ceremony by drinking rum upstairs as she has flashbacks to her real romance a summer ago with the young professor Joseph Patten (Luke Treadaway) whom Dolly has invited to the wedding (to her mother's (Elizabeth McGovern) chagrin and Joseph waits downstairs with the entire bizarre family and friends awaiting Dolly's descent to proceed to the church. The story is interrupted with all manner of subplots including the strange behavior of Dolly's younger sister Kitty (Ellie Kendrick) who provides the audience with a navet&eacute; that reveals so much about what everyone else is really thinking but just can't bring themselves to say.Among the entertaining eccentrics having luncheon before the wedding are the bickering married couple (Fenella Woolgar and Mackenzie Crook) attempting to stop their son young Jimmy (Ben Greaves Neil) from setting off little bombs throughout the house, aging but silly Aunt Bella (Barbara Flynn) seducing her chauffeur (Emil Lager), the perennial old maid Miss Spoon (Joanna Hole), the day's drunk Tom (Olly Alexander) and of course the only people about whom we care   the servants (Eva Traynor, Paola Dionisotti, Sophie Stanton, Kenneth Collard.  The use of flashbacks to give us insight into Dolly's dilemma of marrying for convenience instead of for love is beautifully handled by creating a golden glow touch to the sequences from the past by cinematographer John Lee and a lovely musical score by Michael Price.  And in a final farewell speech Joseph manages to put everything in its rightful place. It all works well, but put on the subtitles or you'll be in the dark.

This is Hannibal Lector and Will Graham before ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""; it is all original material, and while informed by the novels, it is not based on a recreation of any published book.

"  Nate Ford: ""Let's go steal the Department of Defense.""  Parker: ""Isn't that... treason?""  Nate Ford: ""We'll give it back.""These well meaning crooks must go thru a lot of ear wigs; maybe Costco sells them in bulk. LEVERAGE has made it thru three seasons, which bodes well for those TNT viewers aspiring to be career criminals. Shows like this one and WHITE COLLAR and even BURN NOTICE go a ways in gratifying your inner grifter. Me, I've been taking notes, just in case my day job doesn't pan out. I'm this close to mastering the ""Fiddle Game"" and the ""Vegas Wakeup Call"" scam.The end of Season 2 found incarceration beckoning for Nate Ford, the mastermind who made sure everyone else on his team got away clean. Season 3 finds him still behind bars, but he seems to be okay with serving out his sentence. It took learning that a fellow inmate had been framed for Nate to call in the cavalry and to turn the tables on the shady warden. But, once out of stir, things don't quite revert to status quo. Not when Nate is promptly blackmailed by a mysterious beautiful woman (Elisabetta Canalis) and given six months to take down Damien Moreau, shadowy financier to the most notorious, high powered criminals all over the globe. It always means more when a season is galvanized by an ongoing plot thread.When not taking on missions which will get them closer to nabbing Damien Moreau, the Leverage team is in full on Robin Hood mode as it takes on the likes of corrupt CEOs, murderous record executives, ruthless debt collectors, and even the Russian cartel. The fantastic cast keeps on being fantastic and these actors are a well oiled machine at this point, with Christian Kane lending sly nuance and depth to his blunt force ""hitter"" character and Beth Riesgraf's juuuust a bit deranged, socially at sea master thief, Parker, never failing to entertain with her offbeat takes. The humor springs mostly from the character interactions. And I haven't yet gotten tired of watching these ambitious heists unfold, with its resulting twists and swerves. Nate Ford may have reverted to being a drunk, but he's still got all the angles covered. Mostly.Now that we've invested in these characters for some years, it means more when we catch glimpses of their back stories. Not too surprisingly, some of my favorite episodes in Season 3 are those which delve into the crew's respective pasts. Not that we learn everything, not even close. I'm still waiting to learn Sophie Devereaux's real name. Still, in ""The Inside Job,"" to help out her mentor (Richard Chamberlain), Parker goes off on her own and gets trapped inside a building when she tries to crack a Steranko, the world's toughest security system. ""The Studio Job"" not only features a marvelous heel turn by John Schneider but also reveals a surprising talent of Eliot's (hint: he becomes a bonafide country music star). Meanwhile, ""The King George Job,"" set mostly in England and centering on the team's efforts to ennoble a sinister antiques trafficker, unveils a choice bit in Sophie's murky history. As part of a con during a symphony concert, Hardison has to perform a violin solo in ""The Scheherazade Job."" And, in ""The Three Card Monte Job,"" Nate matches wits with his wily crooked father.And then there are those other terrific episodes. ""The Rashomon Job"" tells an offbeat caper set five years ago, in which the Leverage crew, not having yet gotten acquainted, each separately penetrated the Boston Museum's security to go after a tenth century Persian dagger. ""The Ho Ho Ho Job"" details the crew's attempt to infiltrate a mall on Christmas eve to restore Santa Claus's reputation. Season 3's explosive final two episodes   ""The Big Bang Job"" and ""The San Lorenzo Job""   finally pit Nate Ford and his ace criminals against the elusive Damien Moreau. All in all, a satisfying third season, never mind that we don't quite get that high stakes, game changing thrill we got from the climax of Seasons 1 & 2. Never mind, too, that Elisabetta Canalis's character arc pretty much goes nowhere. I was expecting her enigmatic Italian blackmailer to play a larger role.Special features for LEVERAGE   THE THIRD SEASON include: ""On Set with Colton & Aboud: The New Writers of LEVERAGE"" is basically a skit as these two newbies fail to get respect from the crew, as well as someplace to sit (00:02:20 minutes long); ""What Does A Producer Do?""   another lighthearted piece as the show's producers break down their job responsibilities (00:02:33); ""Inside the LEVERAGE writer's Room"" details the process in which the writers work up an episode story (00:02:30); 4 Deleted Scenes; ""Behind the Scenes""   executive producer director Marc Roskin and visual effects producer Mark Franco go over selected scenes from ""The Big Bang Job"" (00:07:40); the Season 3 Gag Reel (00:05:37); and, awesomely, Cast & Crew Audio Commentary for each episode.",Let's go steal Season 3,1307923200,"06 13, 2011",4,1

"""I think it's OK to panic now."" A very serious disease strain has begun to cause havoc all over the world and it's called severe olfactory syndrome (SOS). It begins by smelling something that reminds you of someone you know who has died, then one by one you begin to lose your senses. During the outbreak chef Michael (McGregor) and scientist Susan (Green) begin to fall in love and their relationship is tested over and over as their senses begin to fail. Even the the plot may sound a little hokey this is actually a very good movie. At once the movie is both disturbing and sweet as well as erotic. The acting is fantastic as you believe that they are really losing their senses and you really begin to feel bad for them. To me this is a little scary because it makes me wonder if this could actually happen (from some chemical) and how I would act. This movie will give you hope and break your heart at the same time. I recommend this but it is a movie that will leave you worn out and not really in the mood to do anything after. Overall, a very good movie that is both disturbing and wonderful.

"This show is great. Plain and simple. A private consulting firm that specializes in deception training and recognizing people's ""tells"" is a great twist in the crime drama genre. I am also a big fan of Tim Roth, I think he's a great actor and he does an incredible job in this show. There are great characters, creative plots, and just all around great watching.There is underlying drama going on in the various characters' lives, which they touch on in each episode but they don't get too in depth with. It's almost like giving a starving dog a small treat, just enough to make you want to watch the entire next episode to see if they reveal any more. This is 5 stars without hesitation.

"I know, I know, this is not what you would expect from a man like me, but this show is about real crimes in a single city in the United States. Broad brushstrokes of data can make you believe that we live in Disneyland compared to other places in the world and mini series shows will make you think all of the U.S. is downtown Detroit.This series is a study of homicides over a thirty year period in a larger of cities that are found on the front range. What is surprising is that there are so many and varied ways to commit murder within the boundaries of Colorado Springs. What makes this show so interesting is Joe Kenda's pithy statements of the criminal and the criminal mind; Better than the show by the same name (Criminal Minds).

"The little explanatory blurb Amazon provided with this movie gave the impression that Harper Lee had written the story behind this film.  In fact, she hasn't written for publication since ""To Kill a Mockingbird"". Horton Foote was actually the writer of the screenplay based on ""TKAM"" written by Lee, and he also wrote the screenplay for ""Main Street"".  Harper Lee had nothing to do with it.Now that I've straightened that out, I'll say that I really enjoyed this sleepy southern drama about a toxic waste team who comes to the dying town of Durham and offers jobs and money to the residents in return for a permanent place to keep the waste (which happens to be a former tobacco warehouse owned by an old woman played to perfection by Ellen Burstyn).  Patricia Clarkson plays her loyal niece, and Colin Firth portrays the hazardous waste advocate who tries to convince the town's leaders that turning it into a toxic waste dump will rejuvenate Durham.There's a subplot involving Orlando Bloom's town cop carrying a torch for a restless local girl, but the underlying theme is that a town is what you make it, not what you imagine it is, and the grjazz may not necessarily be greener on the other side of the fence.  It's not at all a simplistic story of the Good Guys (the town) versus the Bad Guys (the toxic waste company) even though it starts out looking that way. It's much more nuanced, which makes it worth watching. Curiously, two of the actors (Firth and Bloom) playing southerners are actually Brits but are totally convincing.",Harper Lee had nothing to do with this film--but that's OK,1401840000,"06 4, 2014",5,1

"The above was a quote from one of the &#34;squints&#34; (forensic anthropologist lab geeks) in Season 6 or 7 of this show.  I found Bones on Netflix and became obsessed with this show about a forensic anthropology lab at a thinly disguised Smithsonian (&#34;Jeffersonian&#34;) that pretty quickly and happily becomes completely hijacked by a charismatic FBI agent.  Thanks to Amazon I'm all caught up on the series.  The writing is generally very good, with scientific gee whizish ness alternating with funny or heartbreaking moments of all too human emotion from people who never forget that the remains they are working with were people.  Because of the generally high standard of the writing, I forgive the occasional clunky dialogue or wacky plot twist:  why would a serial killer become obsessed with a forensic anthropologist?  Similarly, the chemistry between all the actors, especially the two stars, allows me to overlook the occasional wooden moment. I recently watched the first few episodes from the first season over again and realized just how much the characters had grown over time.  All in all, if you have a strong stomach    and don't mind seeing someone else's (the special effects remains wise are really convincing) I highly recommend seeing this dramedy.",&#34;This is revolting . . . and so much fun!!!&#34;,1357948800,"01 12, 2013",5,1

"""This is important, there is no room for mistakes."" When A bio tech company is looking for someone to get a test animal for them they turn to Martin (Dafoe). After traveling to Tasmania for his job he meets a young girl named Sjazz and her family. The family begins to change the way he feels about the job, but the company sends constant reminders. This is another very surprising movie. When it boils down to it the movie is pretty much about poaching...but it is so much more. The movie is very heartfelt and surprisingly emotional. While also being a little depressing the movie is very much worth watching. Dafoe is great in this movie and I have to say that even though the movie doesn't sound interesting this is a very good movie and will not disappoint.

"This is in my opinion the best Cable TV dramatic series that has ever aired. I know 'The Sopranos' is very popular and so is 'Breaking Bad' but if you have to choose   this is the winner.Now I'll admit that I am a fan of Roman history. I have read all of Tacitus, Suetonius, Livy, Plutarch, and Polybius as well as a number of the minor historians. I have read many modern historians who wrote about Rome like Delbruck. And I have read lots of historical fiction set in Rome. So I can't claim to be neutral about the time period.This series gets a lot of things right that are usually gotten wrong. For example the rival cable  Starz  answered this series with a Roman themed series of their own   Spartacus. Spartacus is wildly inaccurate. It is more like alternative history than history. It doesn't even seem to take place on earth much less in earth's history. Spartacus is simply cable TV pornography. I like a little pornography from time to time but Spartacus became just silly. Both series showed full frontal nudity of both sexes but the HBO series handled these elements much more wisely.This series is not perfect. They have made some historical mistakes. I could point out where they got it wrong as a way of demonstrating how clever I am, but I won't. There are several issues of interpretation of  events and facts that I could argue with but I could be wrong too.

"I've long been a fan of the SyFy SciFi Network. I take great pleasure in watching the horrifically poor monster movies that they produce, as well as shows like ""Eureka"", which is one of my all time favorites. I mention this only because when I started watching ""Being Human"" on Netflix, I was confused. The production values were so high, I thought I must have been mistaken about it being a SyFy show. I googled it, and sure enough... it was produced for SyFy, but it seems like it was made for one of the major networks, such care was taken in its manufacture. In no way do I mean this as a slight against SyFy's other, much cheesier productions.At first, I had somewhat mixed feelings about ""Being Human"". The vampire character, Aidan, came off as being terribly cliched and boring. I couldn't believe that yet another story was going to include the stereotypical vampire: pale, dark haired, handsome, moody, full of angst, etc. Likewise, the ghost character, Sally, seemed like a spoiled brat with the sole purpose of whining at every possible opportunity. Yet... I kept watching. Part of the reason for my perseverance was that the story seemed to have great potential (which proved true), and another big reason was that the werewolf character, Josh, was incredibly endearing. His goofy, awkward waddling through life made up for the pissing and moaning of his two roommates.Fortunately, as the season progressed, I grew to have great empathy for all three of these characters. Miraculously, Aidan was salvaged and became somebody that I both admired and empathized with, which is definitely a first in my book, as far as moody, privileged vampires go. I also grew to care for Sally, and empathized with her plight as a spirit caught between worlds, struggling for peace and retribution. Josh continued to appeal to me, and my initial fondness for his character only grew.What is perhaps even more remarkable, on the subject of characters, is how well the lesser ones are developed and brought to life. Bishop, the primary villain, is a monster that truly radiates charisma. Despite his horrible deeds, I could not help but empathize with him, and even root for him at times. Other characters who appear occasionally, such as Ray, are also brought to life with great care and a conflicted array of emotions that is compelling to watch.""Being Human"" does a great job of creating an engaging, enjoyable episode for each week during its first season. More importantly, the continuing story arc was told in excellent fashion, never shying away from embracing REAL consequence, interesting questions, and just the right tone of mystery and mayhem. Well done, SyFy  I can't wait to watch the second season.",The SyFy Network steps up its game,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",5,1

"As a die hard NCIS fan, this season at times left me wanting more. The new girl Bishop felt pushed at the viewers. Like they wanted people to like her, but hate her at the same time. Do to the writers doing this they lost the other actors in the mix. Tony and McGee felt off so much this season, almost like walking on egg shells around the new character to not hurt her feelings. And Gibbs using kids gloves when he would usually tell it like it is and move on.

"This show is about a large close knit extended family constantly spending time together and dealing with the crisis's of everyday life, and absolutely NOBODY can keep a secret.  They mostly seem to be in hectic stress mode and the show is highly emotional.  BUT you like these characters and invest in them quickly and are thus willing and eager to share their joy and pain and all the garbage that is part of life.  There are also some good examples of a good marriage in this show   which is GREAT as so few of us get good role models there in real life.Craig T. Nelson is the father of 2 sons and 2 daughters, and he and his wife are hiding marital problems from their kids. The eldest son has a wife, a teenage daughter and a young son with Asperger syndrome (sort of a high functioning autism) and is highly depended upon by everyone to be ""the fixer"" in every situation, the other son is single and something of a commitment phobe who just discovered he has a 5 yr old son he never knew about (who by the way is a really adorable kid), Lauren Graham plays the older daughter who at age 38 returns home to live with her parents and start life over after having divorced her musician junkie husband   with 2 semi delinquent teenage kids in tow (a son and a daughter), and the other daughter is a lawyer trying to squeeze in some ""mom"" time with her daughter and her husband is the perfect handsome who gave up contracting construction work to be a perfect stay at home dad to their little girl.The whole cast is fantastic and the show absolutely holds your attention. (And I am thankful to have another series to watch the incredible Lauren Graham in!)I didn't get to see this show on TV, so I was thrilled to be able to watch it on Amazon Prime (pretty much back to back and minus commercials!)

"I haven't watched the first season in its entirety, but I have watched enough episodes to have a grasp on the show and material. I was first heard about this through a lifetime teaser, which sucked because I didn't have the lifetime channel. When I found out it was on netflix, I got all excited and hoped it would live up to my expectations. Usually things fall far short from how they first appear, but this series has kept me interested and entertained the entire time.Details: The show starts out with a supermodel (Deb, I believe) who is extremely vain and couldn't picture herself as anything but a size 0, maybe 2, and is one of those ""beautiful people"". The word superficial definitely comes to mind. Due to an accident involving a truck and some grapefruit, which seems like a pretty bad way to die in my opinion, she makes her way up to a purgatory type locale. When trying to decide where her fate lies, she takes matters into her own hands and presses the ""return"" button on her guardian angel's keyboard. This sends her back to Earth but as Jane, a super intelligent lawyer with a heart of gold and a bit of extra weight. Basically, almost the exact opposite of Deb. The show helps Deb (in Jane's body) with several realizations that life is about more than just looks.Drama: To add an extra layer to everything, it turns out that Deb's fiance actually works for the same law firm as Jane. Oh how cruel fate can be... And while he is still grief stricken, he has shown some interest in one of their coworkers, much to Jane Deb's dismay.Why 4 out of 5 stars then, you ask? It really ticked me off in the first few episodes when Jane was stressed and her jazzistant would feed her cheeze whiz straight out of a can or give her a doughnut to improve her mood. It almost seemed like the show was saying ""bigger women love to do these types of things, that's why they are bigger"". It was totally unnecessary and inconsiderate.",Great legal drama with a unique twist,1333065600,"03 30, 2012",4,1

"THE ANSWER MAN is that rare film that combines good, quiet humor with cljazz and a deep moral lesson. Think that's easy? Try to think of at least one title with which to compare this film.It's been 20 years since Arlen Faber (a brilliant Jeff Daniels) has published his magnum opus book, ""Me and God"" (the title should have been a big red flag all by itself). Trouble is, though Faber is globally revered and ""has cornered 10% of the God market"", he's a tourettic, reclusive a hole who desperately needs the simplest answers for himself.With his back thrown completely out one day, after having spent possibly 24 hours on the floor, Faber literally crawls to his local neighborhood chiropractor, the dingy Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). She heals him rather rapidly and he falls for her. Not long after this, Faber encounters Kris Lucas (the beautiful Lou Taylor Pucci, who has the eyes lashes of Elizabeth Taylor and is best known for his title role in 2005's THUMBSUCKER), a forlorn recovering alcoholic bookstore owner. It is totally hilarious to watch the running side line story of Faber trying to return 50 or 60 self help books, and Lucas refusing them.A most hilarious scene with Faber in disguise, furiously shelving the books Lucas cannot buy back, results in Lucas catching hold of Faber's coat. Realizing who the mystery grouch is, Lucas blackmails him: Lucas will take back 5 books in exchange for the answer to one vital question. IN the end, Faber is helping Lucas because he wants to help this sweet, likeable boy.Faber is not only a lost man in pain, he is a foul tempered, foul mouthed sad soul who cannot deal well with people. On one level he is clearly tired of everyone thinking he is the Answer Man. As a priest, I know the feeling. As a flawed, ordinary man, I can identify with both Faber and Kris Lucas  their pain, frailty and vulnerability. They never really connect because they are the same man at different ages.Get this lovely, gentle and hilarious film  and find out the real meaning of life.","I think Sartre put it best when he said, ""Hell is other people.""",1278806400,"07 11, 2010",5,1

"I will never understand movie critics.  Every New York paper trounced this film when it was released grousing about Romans having British accents and attacking it as mindless entertainment.  Hey, every epic cannot be Stanley Kubrick's 'SPARTACUS"" or Ridley Scott's 'GLADIATOR' but if you're looking for a rousing adventure film, look no further.  These critics should have stuck with the countless bathroom humor comedies and inane human dramas populating the theaters as of late and leave the action movie genre to the people who appreciate them.  Neil Marshall's latest film 'CENTURION' is a relentless experience from the first frame of film projected to the last and you would have to be a block of wood not to be effected by its intensity.  Based on a true story about the ninth Roman Legion which disappeared in Scotland in the realm of the Picts on their campaign of conquest, it shows the survivors struggling against the terrain and the cunning of the ultimate Pict tracker to get back home.  You've read the reviews contained within this release space in Amazon.com so I won't go on but I will tell you that the action is electrifying with the standout being Olga Kurylenko (QUANTUM OF SOLACE) in a malevolent performance as Etain, the voiceless Pict tracker who never stops her pursuit of the Roman survivors. The filmmakers pull no punches in the realism of the battle scenes and fight sequences , yes, heads are lopped off when they meet a sharp blade and body harm does occur when confronted with arrows,axes and fire so be prepared for a bloody time.  Marshall balances how we feel about both Roman and Pictish sides showing the futility of war and invading territories which should not be invaded, hell, he shows the Romans attacking their own men because they are wearing Pict clothing.  Comments on the acting of Michael Fjazzbinder and Dominic West as being pjazzionless and wooden are as legion as the Romans but I think they are perfect showing the way they probably were, arrogant and honorable to their last breath. Magnolia Home Entertainment has released a crisp transfer with excellent 5.1 Dolby Digital EX which was beautifully separated on my sound system and contains a great audio commentary by the director and crew, deleted scenes which show why they were excised for they would have slowed the film down and five behind the scenes featurettes on the cast, locations, and cinematography.  Many may conceive this film as mindless eye candy but Director Writer Neil Marshall has created and produced an intense, nerve wracking 98 minutes of celluloid and should be comfortable in knowing that 'CENTURION"" is a cult cljazzic ready to explode.",Roman Legions Gathered Together In Scotland and Grooving with The Picts,1288915200,"11 5, 2010",5,1

"I am not a Formula 1 fan but I love history so this appealed to me for that reason. It starts at the Melbourne Grand Prix of 1996 where Martin Brundle had an horrific crash but survived almost unscathed   the car was completely totalled.  Then it takes us back to the very beginning and we get a whistle stop tour   well it was always going to have speed involved   of the `Golden Era' of F1.This is not just about the drivers either; we get to hear from family members like James Hunt's son and wives etc. Also we get the men behind the sport which has to include Bernie Eccelstone and Colin Chapman, the man behind Lotus.  We go through the highs and lows, the developments that took speed further and the negligence of track owners and organisers as to the safety of the drivers and the spectators. The names of the participants read as a veritable who's who of the motor racing world. We have Nicki Lauda, Jackie Stewart, Michael Schumacher, Emmerson Fitipaldi  and both Damon Hill and his father to name but a few.There is oodles of archive footage as well as contemporary interviews and an awful lot of honesty about just how unprofessional some of the behind the scenes antics were. It all makes for fascinating stuff. Whilst a lot of aspects of F1 are covered the controversy around sponsorship and moreover tobacco sponsorship is never alluded to. Whilst that may never have been part of the remit, it would have been nice for the juxtaposition of asking for health and safety in the sport to be taken seriously whilst promoting a product with known health issues. Still this was a different age with very different values and the development of the cars is also fascinating, with wings etc all adding to the increased speeds. The all too frequent crashes are never shown in any way that could be called exploitative and you do get a genuine feeling of regret at the unnecessary loss of life that took place over the decades. I had very little expectations of this documentary but film maker Paul Crowder has done a rather fine job and this is a film I can easily recommend.",Fascinating Documentary on how Formula 1 got safer,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",4,1

"This is a good movie with some really good acting.The director is trying to keep us guessing all through the movie if there is a vampire around us.The story is a usual boarding school college roommate problem with a spice. Rebecca shows up after summer vacation for her second year in a very selective boarding school. Her father, a famous poet, committed suicide several years ago and she still hasn't recovered. Her roommate (Lucie) for two years is very supportive and acts as her family in the school. All is well until mid semester a new student (Ernessa) arrives at the school. She takes over Lucie's life who drops Rebecca and now follows Ernessa all day long. Lily Cole (Ernessa) provides a stunning performance. She is really mysterious and she moves like a vampire. The acting overall is really good throughout the movie and we really care about the characters.At one point Rebecca throws herself on one of the teachers because she is alone and desperate. He is trying to take advantage of her and when she pushes him away he is reporting her to the principal. While this is totally irrelevant to the entire movie plot it shows how some low life scum pseudointelectuals with an easy degree in English can infiltrate high schools, boarding schools or colleges and take advantage of the young students. Actually these so called teachers get hired in these institutions of higher education just to hide from society.This is a good movie, with not much gore for a vampire movie. Both Rebecca and Ernessa are believable and make a really good story that should have been in theaters. Four stars for the incomplete plot since we don't really know much about Ernessa's entire life by the end of the movie.

"This movie is about a guy who is obsessed with Bigfoot, and about what happens when he drags his girlfriend into the woods to film his search for the elusive monster.There are a lot of reasons to hate this film. Read a few one star reviews and you'll gather that much. If you want a Cliff's Notes version, though, I'll give it to you.WHY YOU'LL HATE IT:1. It's the very definition of a ""slow burn"" horror. I normally hate these. Basically, there's a lot of slow, cautious, subtle build up. No false scares or what I call Score Screams    when the music wails to let you know something scary will or is happening. In fact, there aren't any boos or bumps or creepy moments until about forty or fifty minutes into the film, and this flick sits at a super lean 80 minutes long.2. There is no gore. There are no reveals. Much like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, there is no explicit revelation. I'm not going to say there is or isn't an actual Bigfoot or other monster in the film, but if there is, you won't see it. This will certainly upset a huge portion of horror fans, who like their terror vivid and up close and bloody.3. There are no easy answers. The movie    regardless of what any other reviewer might suggest    DOES very carefully and clearly spell out what is going on, but this is done with inventively meticulous foreshadowing that some viewers will miss just because they're waiting for all of the screaming and yelling to begin.WHY I LIKED IT:Look. I gave up on found footage after THE DEVIL'S DUE. I'm officially sick of it, and I'm one of the long time hold outs. It's hard to find a found footage film that isn't using the found footage technique to distract from the fact that they have a story that is overly simple or even barely there. (There are exceptions to this    THE BAY, for instance, and BEHIND THE MASK    but they are rare.) However, Bobcat Goldthwait, who's quickly becoming one of my favorite writer directors, understands the basic limitations of the genre and actually uses them to good effect.For instance, most found footage is a knee jerk attempt to make the viewer feel like the experience is realer than it is. Other movies do this with interesting stories and dialogue and characters and directing. Found footage just says, ""See? It looks like it was filmed by amateurs on a camcorder! That makes it feel REAL!"" It's cheap. Usually. But WILLOW CREEK benefits enormously from some of the most authentic, subdued, natural, and amusing performances I've ever seen by our two leads. It's incredibly rare to find performances this quietly jazzured in a found footage film. Some might find them boring    I repeat: they really DO seem like a young couple on a road trip, and not all young couples are full of clever insights or wit    but I found their portrayals so seamless that it was a treat to watch them even when it seemed like nothing was happening.And when stuff did start happening? There is a moment in the film when the camera doesn't move for about twenty minutes. It is literally a shot of two people wondering what is going on. Action thirsty horror fans might hunger for monsters, claws, blood, flesh, and hasty escapes. And I won't say there weren't moments when I checked my watch and wondered how long it was going to last. However, what Goldthwait was going for    showing you what it would actually be like to be in a tent in the wilderness and wonder exactly what was going outside of those thin, fabric walls    was an almost total success. Not only was it pretty amazing that the actors managed to deliver such an intense performance for such a sustained amount of time, but the pacing and tempo of the reveals and questions and general creepiness was very seductive to me.Like I said, I normally hate slow burns and general ambiguity in my horror films, but this movie didn't use its plot or its found footage ness to trick or manipulate me like so many of them do. Instead, it tried to tell a simple (and pretty disturbing) tale with as much honesty and forthrightness as the found footage genre normally lies about possessing. And with an ending that will only make sense to viewers who are willing to give the film some serious observation and thought, it was a reward that is rare these days: a scary film that plays hands off and still avoids pretension. Even at its short running time, it still runs a little long, and like many found footage films, there is a bit of repetition at play, but even with these shortcomings, it has managed to help restore even just a little my faith in a genre (both found footage and the old ""monster in the woods"" horror genre) that I had long given up on.",The Point of Found Footage,1403049600,"06 18, 2014",4,1

"Now, this show has gotten better again. While Season 1 was absolutely great, the novelty slightly wore off during Season two where some of the situations were simply not that funny.It still stars the stellar cast of Tina Fey as Liz Lemon and Alec Baldwin as Jack Donaghy, her boss at NBC. While the writing is extremely clever and these two actors are plendid, some of the secondary cast members are slightly over the top and do distract such as Tracy Morgan and Jane Krakowski. Well anyway as I wrote the comedy is better than in Season two even if as usual it is slightly over aware of its ""impact"". Indeed, as most SNL derived comedy, it tends to be somewhat superior in its approach and over smug. However this show can afford it due to its brilliant acting and writing. Sometimes the humour is of the flat ""I am great"" SNL style but not too often. The show could use a more relaxed kind of comedy sometines but overall it is a joy to wtach and it does deserve all the praise it gets.",Really good!,1254700800,"10 5, 2009",4,1

"When an episode of ""Intervention"" covers two individuals, I usually find one person's story compelling and the other's negligible.  This episode showed two stand out people.  I think a student could write a great paper comparing and contrasting the two.  Both interviewees have troubled and troubling father son issues, but otherwise, they'll be seen as quite different.  Honestly, I think Middle America will relate to one and not the other.Josh is morbidly obese.  But he's a straight, white, probably middle cljazz guy.  Unlike many a lonely, fat dude, he does have a woman in his life though they are called broken up here.  Josh's father is one of those ""My house, my rules!"" tyrannical fathers.  The work never says anything about it, but it's funny to me that his father is named Rex, which means ""king"" in Latin.  A study suggested that although we fat men look jolly and good natured, we're mostly angry and possessed with many a demon.  I soooo wanted to hug Josh, but also get him on a treadmill at the same time.  Josh's two younger brothers were thin and unfortunately it's never spelled out how they avoided Josh's and Rex's predicaments.I personally am fascinated about when biraciality and bisexuality intersect.  Ben is biracial and could be called bisexually active.  I wish the show discussed his identity(ies) with him, but it didn't.  It struck me that he was pjazzionate about books on European history, but I wonder if he'd enjoy ethnic studies or LGBT studies texts.  Unfortunately, Ben seemed like a terrible waste of gifts.  He has a 170 IQ, but his other traits present him as the stereotypical tragic mulatto.  We see him eating discarded food and laughing at garbage removal.  He sleeps in a damp basement.  Along with his unique identities, he was addicted to a unique drug, something called DMX which is over the counter.  Ben has a bruise near one eye and we never learn why: was he punched?  did he fall?  is it a lesion?  Speaking of tragic mulatto, he tries to sneak services from a prostitute and then acts surprised when her pimp retaliates.  Initially, I asked myself if this is an example of the furor in the African American community about ""the down low.""  However, Ben spoke freely of prostituting himself and even his mother knew about it.  Ben is seen with a chubby, cute GBM named Todd, a former client.  As mentioned, identity matters are not discussed, but I wonder if Ben could turn his life around if he had more Black, gay mentors or peers like Todd.Again, I think most viewers would relate to Josh and not Ben.  However, I could list many ways in which it's the Bens of the world who are the most oppressed and need our support the most.  I saw another TV installment which suggested that Josh is really changing things and headed in the right direction.  However, in line with tragic mulatto tropes, this episode concludes with a lack of good news for Ben.This is one of my favorite episodes of ""Intervention.""

"Students of politics should love this series. Game theorists should too. Actually even ordinary mortals will love it. Although the title is Revenge, power is at the center of every episode. Understanding that power can be defined in terms of its resources, the principle resources in this instance are information and secrecy. It is no surprise that Amanda Clarke (actually Emily Thorn) is dead and Emily Thorn (actually Amanda Clarke) is still alive, although she has come through some close scrapes. It is the secrecy that has saved Emily from the ongoing maliciousness of the Graysons. Clarke was ""out"" and Thorn was still in the shadows. Of course with the aid of Nolan Ross, a low key tycoon and cyber wizard, Emily (actually Amanda in the shadows) is able to have access and opportunity to observe the mischief of the Graysons on their laptop, and watch the ongoing chicanery unfold. By remaining in the shadows they are able to toy with various Grayson endeavors. The tone of the story is superficial civility masking underhanded, backstabbing and ruthlessness. Even murder is in the vocabulary of malicious action for the Conrad Grayson, but Emily is a martial arts practitioner and capable of pointing a gun and squeezing the trigger herself.  Emily (actually Amanda) keeps score by recording an ""X"" through the  faces of pictures of her targeted foes stored in a box of ""keepsakes"" under her living room floor as she embarrjazzes or inflicts damage upon her targets. I love this series for its intricacy of the game. I once had a college professor tell me that a characteristic of great art is that it lacks immediacy. This seriously meets that test.

"In the primetime TV landscape, the usual program options have become increasingly formulaic, predictable and safe. With more than half of all network dramas being variations on the crime procedural, something that bucks the trend really has the potential to stand out. Even riskier is trying to adapt a horror offering within the strictures of regular TV in an era when audiences seem to clamor for more explicit and graphic thrills (see FX's delightfully loopy and crazed American Horror Story for something that really pushes the boundaries of conventional fare as it has much more freedom on cable). So I commend ABC executives for greenlighting the interesting eight part experiment by filmmaker Oren Peli (who made a name for himself with Paranormal Activity). He shares the creator credit for this show with Michael R. Perry (he was also a writer on Paranormal Activity 2), a TV veteran who has dabbled in the horror genre before penning episodes of the underrated and short lived ""American Gothic"" and Chris Carter's ""X Files"" follow up ""Millennium."" While not always perfect, therefore, ""The River"" certainly has the distinction of feeling different and that's undeniably a good thing.The idea behind ""The River"" is a good one. Bruce Greenwood plays a popular TV naturist who disappears while on an expedition in the Brazilian wilds. He and his crew are presumed dead. His wife (Leslie Hope) and estranged son (Joe Anderson) put together another documentary crew in an effort to find, and hopefully rescue, the missing men. Trying to piece together what happened through found footage, this new team faces increasingly strange and deadly obstacles the deeper they go. And it becomes abundantly clear that this voyage will have a body count as they seem to be pursuing a location known ominously as the Source. Will it hold the answers they desire? Is Greenwood alive? And will all the random horror elements be pulled together to make sense within a greater plot overview?The Good:Setting: For me, the best thing about ""The River"" is its unusual premise. ABC was so quick to try to brand this the next ""Lost"" that it overlooked that the two shows have very little common ground. The unexplored jungles and the claustrophobic confines of the river boat lend an unusual backdrop to the unfolding drama. Also, it just looks great.Style: While the found footage genre has been a bit overworked since the ""Blair Witch Project"" confirmed its commercial viability, it is effective and different to see it employed in series television. As the horrors are unraveled through quick and random camera shots (either through the crew cameramen or through stationary cameras on the ship), the quick glimpses of danger can make things quite unsettling.The Bad:Poor Research: For a show that takes place in Brazil, someone might have noted that they speak Portuguese there as opposed to Spanish.Ambient Sound: When strange things are happening, the program ramps up the sound effects and music to overwhelming proportions. Call me crazy, but I'd rather the dialogue was louder than the lapping of waves while characters in the river are conversing.The Indifferent:Rushed Beginning: The show takes but a few minutes to establish the characters before setting them adrift. It takes a while before we know anyone, much less care about them, and this lessens the impact of the earlier episodes. Stick around, though, things get better.Horrors: The show aims for creepy more than scary, and that it achieves. Network TV is not a great place for in your face monstrosities, and within those limitations, the format does a good job providing some jolts. But our crew experiences such a diverse collection of nightmares, it seems like the creators just wanted to throw everything but the kitchen sink at us and see what stuck. Monsters, possessions, spirits, curses, natives: the mysterious and mystical horrors encompjazz just about everything you can think of. It's almost too much. And, of course, the mechanic's daughter is the requisite character that seems to know ANYTHING and EVERYTHING about these supernatural occurrences so that they can be ""logically"" explained to the TV audience.Hit or Miss Ending: The 7th episode explains Greenwood's fate, but raises more questions than it answers. The screenplay and the characters are content to let most things go down without much contemplation. I did, however, like the finale's (8th episode) turn of events before the take it or leave it final scene.I know people that both love ""The River"" and hate it. I can fully understand either position. But taken for what it is, it provides something different on television and that is an invaluable commodity in the land of cookie cutter TV. At eight episodes, it isn't a huge time commitment and I was pleased enough to go along for the ride. I don't know that ten years from now that I'll be remembering the show as a cljazzic, but for the moment  it was something that I enjoyed and would recommend for the right audience.

Now she is 37, married to Carlos, and they are parents to a little boy, Simon, about seven. They adopted Simon, who doesn't know this, and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay. Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in. It is a large building of many rooms and hallways, with dark oak paneling, old fire places and frosted, etched gljazz. They hope to make it a home for children with special needs. There are no children yet, just Simon.Simon makes friends, make believe friends. They tell him things, he says. ""I won't grow old. I'm not going to grow up,"" he tells his mother. ""Will you be like Peter Pan?"" Laura asks. ""Like my new friends,"" Simon says. ""There's more than one?"" ""Six."" ""They won't grow up either?"" Laura asks. Simon looks at her. ""They can't,"" he saysSimon leads Laura in a game to discover clues, a game he and his friends have invented. Suddenly the game is foreboding. ""You're not my mother!"" Simon screams at Laura. ""Who told you that?"" she asks, stricken that this little boy, her son, is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older. ""My friend told me,"" Simon says. ""What friend?"" ""Tomas,"" Simon yells, crying and defiant. ""Tomas told me the truth, that I'm just like them.... I have no mother or father and I'm going to die.""Days later, Simon disappears, apparently kidnapped. The parents, with Laura increasingly frantic, try everything to find him. In time, there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans. We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.So...whose imagination, whose story are we inhabiting?""Horror"" is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so. Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things. Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects. The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie. It is lonely, deliberative, sad, thoughtful, even quiet, even, surprisingly, with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.All the actors do fine jobs, and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near. It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special. There are so many opportunities for intense ""acting,"" distraught ""acting,"" tearful ""acting."" Rueda does nothing of this. We believe her as Laura because she doesn't try to over dramatize Laura. Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught. She also puzzles through this mystery, is determined to find her son and can take action. But Rueda never overacts. Thanks to Rueda's performance and fine directing and screenwriting, I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.The audio and video transfers are very good. There are some typical ""How we made the movie"" extras. If you have a taste for unusual and unsettling stories, I recommend you tryThe InnocentsandThe Sixth Sense (Collector's Edition Series).","""When something terrible happens sometimes it leaves a trace.

"This show is absolutely ground breaking. I have to say that I find some of these genius children junior chef's are better than some of the chef's I have seen on the original MasterChef. The chemistry between the Judges and the children is outstanding. The children all encourage each other and that is just wonderful to see. In the first episode, the children are broken up into groups. Some make it through, and some don't in each group. These dishes from the savory, to the most complex of sweet dishes is something I have never seen. Some of these children put up Gordon Ramsay Restaurant type of food. I love how the judges always have something positive to say to the children even if they have to give constructive advice on how to improve their dishes. Joe even compared one youngster's sweet dish as a lesson for life. He said to the boy ""life does not always go your way does it?""  ""So what do you do when it doesn't?""  and the young boy said ""you find a way to fix it"".  Joe said ""right, you improvise. And that is what you have done here. Great Job!."" It was a great moment and the interaction with all of them is just heart warming as it is intense and competitive.  They are making real, restaurant quality dishes.  Make no mistake about this. This is real as it gets!  They are not making French toast in the toaster oven.They are utilizing the Masterchef kitchen and in many cases doing a better job then many adults that have come through those doors.  It is ground breaking to me because they are getting these children from ages 10 to 13 and placing them in a situation with pressure, and time limits to create these amazing dishes.  I wont go into what they made. I want everyone to see it and enjoy the surprise of how sophisticated these dishes are.  I have trouble getting my daughter to do her homework?  How on earth these youngsters can create artistic dishes like these is just beyond my comprehension. The judges all joke around, but are serious when they have to be. They make it fun even with the pressure of having to compete. And never do the judges ever say anything that is negative. It is all great stuff with some idea's to help them. I think this journey they are taking is worth watching for the whole family.  I am even hoping it might inspire my daughter to want to try something new and have the confidence to do it.  There are thousands of reasons to watch. I cant think of one not to.....I say try it, and enjoy it....You cant go wrong in just trying it. But I believe you will be hooked just as I am. This is even more fun then the original Masterchef.  They really created something unique, new, and original for television that we have never seen before. Lastly, its not the judges who you are tuning in for.  They have made the children the stars of this show. It is just brilliantly done. And just good fun. 5 stars all the way......",Most Original Show On Television,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",5,1
"OK, so what if Vegas was NEVER uncomplicated or simple.  It was certainly less crowded.Dennis Quaid shines as &#34;Man's Man, good old boy Rancher turned Sheriff&#34; Ralph Lamb.Jason O'Mara is fun to watch getting in and out of trouble as Jack Lamb, Ralph's younger brother who serves as his deputy.  (Who knew the love of a woman could be so painfully complicated and difficult?)Speaking about difficult love, Sarah Jones was well cast as Mia Rizzo (the light of Jack's life), too bad she's also responsible for skimming Savoy funds for the Mob.Nobody does bad like genuinely nice guy Michael Chiklis, who seems to have a great deal of fun playing Vincent Savino.  You just know he and lamb are eventually going to form some sort of alliance.As Dixon Lamb, Ralph's son, Taylor Handley has his moments, but sort of falls short of the mark.  Then again a lot of Vegas sort'a kind'a falls short of the mark.Perhaps one too many clich&eacute;s ... ever cheery mob boss Savino with a heart of gold ... mafia princess Mia with a heart of gold who's psycho mafia Dad (played to the hilt by character actor Michael Wiseman) tries to kill his daughter's cop boyfriend James, with fists, guns, cattle prods and more ... lascivious movie mogul played by Peter Jacobson of &#34;Starter Wife&#34; fame.  I could go on and on and on ... but you get the drift.  Vegas tries too hard, with a LOT of really good actors, but unfortunately falls way too short in the process.At the end of the season we're left wondering what's going to happen to Porter Gainsley (played by consummate villain actor Michael Ironside).  Sadly for the show, Gainsley has been turned into the redneck equivalent of an unstoppable sociopath terminator robot out for EVERYONE's blood.Evil Gainsley enjoys killing people ... a LOT.  He killed Lamb's wife, put Lamb's sort'a kind'a girlfriend, DA Katherine O'Connell (played by Carrie Anne Moss, you'll remember her as Trinity in The Matrix) in a coma.  It doesn't pay to get too close or too attached to sheriff Lamb ... or any other of the Lamb brothers ... while Gainsley or the Mob's around.  Oh wait, sheriff Lamb and Selvino are working together to take down Gainsley.  Anyone else getting a headache?Don't get me wrong, I love the show and am sad it's been canceled, because it's always had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately the ratings haven't been great, but then that's an other story.Internet based TV numbers aren't counted as ratings, so good programs die, because only live ratings counts.  Which leaves us with programs like &#34;The Voice&#34;, &#34;American Idol&#34; and &#34;Dancing with the Stars&#34; (shudder).",How I long for the simple uncomplicated Vegas,1368921600,"05 19, 2013",5,1

"The final season of ER. The scripts remain as good as they were in year one. The cast has changed almost completely but the city of Chicago and its down and out are still co stars. Ending a series that lasted 15 seasons is like the death of an old friend. I have no clue as to the authentisticty of the medical terminology used or the procedures performed by the actors but what is never in doubt is the humanity of the characters they portrait. These have always been real people with good days and bad days. They make mistakes, they have temper tantrums, they are kind, caring, health care professionals. They have problems at home, they have inter personal issues, they attempt to rise above it all. In the final few episodes we make contact with many former doctors in an attempt at closure. We see the memorial wall in the basement. In the end the show ends appropriately with all hands on deck dealing with the fall out from an industrial explosion.

"I do enjoy watching a good indy flick and I seemed to like this more than did most of the other reviewers.Here's the scoop. Sam is a would be writer. He is supposed to be going on a weekend trip with his bud Marshall, whom he hasn't seen in a year. As it turns out, the place they are to stay at is just down the road from where a weekend wedding excursion is planned. Turns out Sam wants to break up said wedding because he's in love with the bride (Uma Thurman) and is convinced she loves him. All type of insanity ensues and things get really crazy.Like all indy flicks this relies on writing and acting. I loved the script and the principal actors did a fine job. In regard to the script: The writer (also director Max Winkler) plays his cards close to his chest. The viewer sees certain things going on fairly early on. But other things he metes out, bit by bit, to fill in the spaces. I also like the characters, warts and all. No one here is a really good person, but none is really bad either. They all just have a lot of baggage and it gets in the way of their dealing with one another. I thought the dialogue, particularly Sam's, was outstanding. And Michael Angarano, delivers Sam's lines with great aplomb. Reece Thompson, as Marshall, does an equally fine job as a person traumatized by a violent attack a year earlier. Uma Thurman has a face you can't take your eyes off and she's as good as always here. Lee Pace might be too much of a caricature as the self absorbed actor and Uma's beau, but, for my dollar, that was the only down side to the flick.All the production values are of a professional level. There are some nifty tunes on hand that well underscore the story. There is a subtle (maybe not so) gay thing going on between the two leads and it is vague. Winkler doesn't play it out and that might be what put off some of the viewers. Be that as it may I really liked this flick. The great characters, clever padder and off the wall scenes just lend themselves to a good time. Oh....and don't forget Uma Thurman.",Meet You at the Baggage Claim,1361491200,"02 22, 2013",4,1

"I'll bet you never wondered what goes on behind the scenes in your local supermarket: why items are placed where they are, what equipment is used for the checkers, when specials are planned and how careers are made or ruined based on the success or failure of these decisions.Screening audiences attending this 2012 Seattle International Film Festival entry from the USA will never wonder; we got to watch these corporate shenanigans in living color!We saw:* Parker Posey (""Inside Out"") is a recently hired dynamo brought in to re energize this mid size supermarket chain. Her take no prisoners style is immediately obvious when she fires a high timer unjustly, simply so she can re invest his significant salary on promotional material.* Eric Mabius (Lots of TV) is a frustrated music industry professional, temporarily (he hopes) side tracked into supermarket management. He is seduced by the siren song of success, with a salary increase and unexpected temptation.

"this show just keeps getting better. We are now into the 3rd series and the characters are well established. I still miss the father of the cop character from the first season , but other than that you have a fine ensemble cast. In this one 'audrey' must stop a troubled person from killing off people by drowning them. Is that person evil or is it not their fault that their trouble is killing people off? You never know with this show , as the mystery has played out over the seasons we learn more but there is still more to learn. Which is a good thing. I miss the chemistry between the two leads; parker and the cop. And the mysterious new big city detectives storyline is intriguing.

"Loved looking at, and hearing ""Alyssa Milano"" since the very first ""CHARMED"" episode. So, once this flick began with her name and face showing up, it was going to be a bearable agony if the story line was not pleasing. Surprise! Actually, the only difficult part was that I wasn't her character's love interest.Easily a warming, while mildly complex romantic melodrama well filmed; crystal clear, good sound, with a theme that is ages old [boy meets girl, girl meets boys] including a tryst and a twist that places ""MY GIRLFRIEND'S BOYFRIEND"" in a category with the Olde Days' movies that ""Katherine Hepburn"", ""Spencer Tracy"", ""Cary Grant"" and ""Lauren Bacall"" made.Putting aside my personal desires, ""Alyssa Milano"" provides a much broader look into her talents and craft, tossing aside that playful youthful persona when necessary, allowing the Viewer to see the more adult maturity that is probably closer in actual realistic proximity to her physical nature. I'm not very big on Love Stories, but this is a nice one   easy on the eyes, brain and heart...     GBJ","SAPPY, ENCHANTING, LOVABLE LOVE STORY!",1316390400,"09 19, 2011",5,1

"I am a huge fan of Alan Furst, so I was really happy to see a screen adaptation of one my favorite authors. It turns out this is actually a mixture of ""Spies of Warsaw"" with bits of ""The Polish Officer"" thrown in, but they did blend the two in a way that fit very well. The cast is excellent, the settings are authentic, and the overall feel of the series is a fairly worthy rendition of the books.I did have a few minor problems with the series, however. The screenplay adds in a lot of things that aren't in either book, and they tend to hinder the story rather than help it, in my opinion. This is especially noticeable in the relationship between Jean Francois and Anna, but there are a lot of other scenes with added content that is jarring for someone who read the books first. still, this is pretty minor, and none of the extra scenes are really deal breakers.""Spies of Warsaw"" is a top notch drama.

"Very interesting that they are making this series.  And the first three episodes seem to me that they are doing a good job of the subject, about children who seem to show signs that they remember things about a past life.  It makes sense to me that on an organic planet, where everything is recycled, that spirits could be too.  But what never makes sense to me is that so many folks ""reincarnate"" from known figures, e.g. designer of the Titanic, screenwriter of ""Gone with the Wind,"" etc.  A teeny tiny fraction of one percent of humans are known to very many of the rest of us, so it makes more sense that the vast majority of reincarnation memories would be of a totally ordinary Johns or Janes.

But hey at least that's way better than 7th Heaven which at least isn't coming back. Why can't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it. I got into Veronica Mars the most this season, so it really bugs me that it got canceled. Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural, so why would they have to cut this show too ?

The best character by far is Michael Cudlitz (""Bull"" from Band of Brothers)the street Cop who has seen too much, done too much, has no life apart from his job and is spiraling out of control in his personal life. This guy has nailed every role he's had since 'BoB', he is great in my opinion. Regina King is also wonderful as the tough detective with a 'do nothing' partner played by Tom Everet Scott.

"The focus character David (Ryan Gosling) is one very ill and disturbed  man. After being left alone by his father (Frank Langella) as a seven year old child, he witnessed his mother's violent suicide. This has steered his life forever off track from what is expected of him: A stoic strength of character which is always demanded from his hyper controlling father.  All of his life, this is what is forced on David without exception. He is the eldest and will be required to carry on the family's crooked high grossing real estate business from a certain point onward. He is being groomed in the business from the outset. David does not argue with his father as concerning him there is no gauntlet to throw down, while he follows orders in an almost robotic fashion. He is always being mercilessly put down as a weakling in front of others or shamed while alone with his father.We are introduced to David, on the way to a high society function. Decked out in a tuxedo after returning from a call for his father. He must go to fix a leak at an apartment their family business owns  because his father is just cruel enough to have David do it in lieu of a contractor. This is when he is much younger. In the early seventies and rebelling just a bit although David cannot totally. He walks into the apartment of his future bride Katie (Kirsten Dunst giving a knockout performance).  David's father does not approve of the relationship or subsequent marriage as she is not 'one of their people'. She dreams of going to medical school and becoming a doctor. Also wishes to have children with David after they are married and open a health food store in VT. Of which they do and are blissfully happy then without the pressure of David's father. He soon shatters their happiness and coerces them to move into a big money apartment.They are still in the first bloom of their love when Katie announces that she is pregnant. Unfortunately they did not discuss this issue before marriage. Katie is shocked when David finally tells her he never wanted nor wants to have children in the future to Katie's complete devastation. A full reason for this rationale is never offered.  The often disjointed way of thinking that David suffers from really starts to become more apparent here. Consequently Katie must handle the pregnancy issue herself and she is never the same after this horrendous event for her. In fact nothing is ever the same and the plot of the movie begins to get sketchy, that is if you don't already recall this incident in history.I don't want to throw in spoilers to the movie so I'll try to end this part rather vaguely. It is at this point where Katie disappears. David apparently suffers a type of mental breakdown or calculated state of rage that throws his life out of control. The writers make both seem plausible through the narration that continues throughout the movie from the outset. David is talking while on the stand during his trial in 2003 from the beginning of the film.This is a completely engrossing movie, extremely psychologically eerie and superbly acted by Gosling and Dunst. He is such a multidimensional actor to be able to make this unusual role seem so real. When the film ended I felt like I was sort of in shock for what had happened here with Katie. Also for the anguish in this terribly damaged man suffering because of his father's cruelty marking his entire life.  The film could have made itself much more gory or bloody although it took a more cerebral approach. It shocked or scared you with your mind  because it's real. There are a lot of unanswered questions still involving this real case. If you enjoy frighteningly surreal crime dramas or off the wall and unsettling relationship stories, this movie may appeal to you.",One True Shocker Of A Story ...,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",5,1

This is truly a paranormal dream to have a place like a mine that is haunted. Its so dark you can do investigations any time day or night. Their is little electrical to cause EMF spikes so your equipment can focus on other causes for EMF spikes.

While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they haven't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat.

Easily the best new comedy on tv and quickly becoming one of my favorite shows. It really reminds me of the first seasons of The Office but in a police station which sounds like a strange idea but it works perfect. The first season was great especially seeing Peralta (Andy Samberg) and Captain Holt (Andre Braugher) interact and become closer. Joe Lo Truglio is awesome as Boyle giving some truly hilarious lines throughout each episode as does Terry Crews who's basically playing himself it seems.

"I took one star off because this series was abruptly ended after six episodes. Past of this could be due to the fact that at the time of its release in the UK, the market was already saturated with WW II dramas and the series did not get as much critical acclaim as some of the other similar themed shows Also, the lead writer died, which might have made it difficult for the series to continue. Either way, it's a pity as this is a really well made film, with a strong ensemble cast.The story is set on the fictitious St. Gregory's Island, which serves as a substitute for the actual British owned Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey. The period is WW II, when German troops invaded the islands and occupied it for the duration of the war, from 1940 1945. In the series, the story focuses on several plots, revolving around three families: the wealthy Dorrs, made up of the island's Senator, James Dorr (James Wilby) and his wife, Felicity (Clare Holman); the middle cljazz Mahy's comprising father Urban (who dies after being in a bombing raid by the Germans), wife Cjazzie (Saskia Reves) who runs a grocery store, and their two daughters, Angelique (""Downton Abbey's Joanne Froggatt) and June (Samantha Robinson); and finally, the blue collar Jonas family made up of police constable Wilf Jonas (Owen Teale), his wife, Kathleen (Julia Ford), and their two young children.The story centers around these three families and their trials and tribulations, and how their lives intersect those of the German occupiers, primarily Baron Heinrich Von Rheingarten (Philip Glenister), the Kommandant in charge of the island; Captain Muller (Daniel Flynn); Oberleutnant Walker (Conor Mullen); Oberleutnant Flach (Andrew Havill); and Airman Bernhardt Tellemann (""Inspector Lewis'"" Lawrence Fox).The series explores some interesting themes such as what was considered fraternizing with the enemy   young June Mahy, who used to sing at the 50 50 Club pre war finds that her wartime singing at the now German controlled pub is frowned upon by the locals, and despite not having any sexual relations with German officers, is considered a Jerry Bag, a derogatory term used to refer to women who consorted with German soldiers. Her sister Angelique, despite her aversion to the Germans, finds herself falling for the handsome German navigator, Bernhardt. The girls' mother, Cjazzie, hates the Germans and blames them for her husband's death, yet finds she too cannot resist the Germans for too long   getting into a business relationship with the German Harbor Master, Wimmel.Meanwhile, the Dorrs are placed in a precarious position when the Baron commandeers their home for his personal residence and office, and discover to their horror, that their young son Stephen, who was jazzumed to be away fighting in the British Army, has returned on a spying mission for the British.There's also a lot of sexual tension in this series   the Baron is attracted to Felicity, and Wimmel to Cjazzie, but the most enigmatic and troubling relationship is between Oberleutnant Walker and a beautiful young woman named Zelda Kay (Louisa Clein). Walker develops an unhealthy obsession with Kay despite her thwarting his repeated advances. The man is a brute yet also lonely and craving company and understanding, but goes about things all wrong. This evolution of this relationship was one of the highlights of the series for me.When the series ends after six episodes, several significant plot lines are left unresolved   what happens to Angelique and Bernhardt's relationship? Will their wartime romance survive after the war? Will Walker give up his pjazzion for Zelda and will Zelda ever get away from him? How about Cjazzie and June? What becomes of them? None of these are addressed with any degree of satisfaction at the conclusion of episode six. I really wish they'd do a wrap up but the show ended in 2003, so I highly doubt it'll be concluded at this point. Still worth viewing in my opinion, and the ensemble cast delivers compelling performances, well worth one's time.",An excellent wartime period drama - sadly without resolution,1392336000,"02 14, 2014",4,1

"The pilot episode of Witches of East End (season 1) is created around the storyline of a caring mother by the name of Joanna Beauchamp, a powerful witch in disguise who is trying to protect her two daughters  Freya and Ingrid.  The series opens with Freya and Ingrid being unaware of their powers.  In particular, the character of Freya is coming to terms with why she is dreaming of a man who ignites her romantic interest and comes face to face with in real life. However, she has justified reasons for steering clear. Meanwhile, Ingrid is at first shown as the skeptical one but decides to help cast a fertility spell for one of her friends. In the midst of it all, people are being murdered and a definitive sign on the culprit is unavailable. I was guessing the character of Adam may be responsible for the deaths while my husband was guessing that the character of Penelope Gardiner may be responsible (Freya's prospective mother in law). Regardless of who the actual culprit is, I felt that the ending could have at least been accompanied by at least two three more clues of who is responsible for the deaths.  I also wish that there would have been more of a backstory on the circumstances around when Joanna and Wendy  last sister interacted (i.e. which past life). Joanna's character indicated that she was reborn, but information on her sister Wendy's life was even more of a mystery.  It would also be nice to know how Ingrid met her best friends Hudson and Barb. The one minute Barb is confiding to both Ingrid and Hudson about her desire to even turn to magic  to become pregnant.  Then, within the next scene, Ingrid,  Barb, and Hudson are joining forces to help make Barb's ""child"" wish come true.  Obviously, one can then decipher that Ingrid, Barb, and Hudson are friends, but I at first thought that Barb and Hudson were just co workers because the episode jumped right in with Ingrid meeting Barb and Hudson at what looked like a library (rather than at least a brief explanation on how Barb or Hudson came into Ingrid's life). Aside from these caveats, Witches of East End is worth checking out for those who have previously watched the BBC series of Merlin, the U.S. series that is Once Upon A Time, and or those who simply like watching supernatural fantasy magic television series.",Tale Of Two Budding And Powerful Witches And Their Magical Mother,1381363200,"10 10, 2013",4,1

"Adam is a pain in the neck, and rightfully so. Still, he is more than Mitchell wants or needs and so he tries to find a way to get him out of his hair. Mitchell is also feeling here, and feeling is leading him to wonder about a lot of things. He wonders, for instance, if Lia is right about him, if he is safe, and if he should think about love. Also, George and Nina are having a go at things, and things are becoming more and more interesting for the both of them. Combine that with our recently arrived girl and we have a cast of grand things.This episode really sheds light on vampires and the way they are seen. It also shows what depravity exists and just how Mitchell is seen. The Nina and George fest is on, too, and humor has crept into this fray. That is a nice one considering where it went in the last season.As far as goods, this season is on pace for a nice outing. I personally have liked it more and more as I have watched it, and I have watched it a lot. The Adam story is one of many, it seems, and I am not sure if he will appear again.

"Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts, portraying Henry VIII's more youthful and vigorous days.  The timespan is a small one, from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon, to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn... so we only get to wife number 2   plenty of scope for sequels, but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is, the key players here are Henry VIII, in his low 20's, fighting fit and clearly horny (there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season).. Cardinal Wolsey (played with great presence by Sam Neill) the corrupt but efficient First Minister, and Sir Thomas More, the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances, well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama   the scenes of `Real' England, the bars and backstreets, are only rarely seen, but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times.  Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty, may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that, and despite a few forgivable departures from history, this works well as a refresher on Tudor history, and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime, and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest, but rewarding   a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets, and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London, all moderately interesting.  A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition, but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series   a cunning plan, and a welcome one.",Henry 8th's Younger years..,1209168000,"04 26, 2008",4,1

"Being a student and author of historical fiction, I must say the British production companies do ""history"" better than anyone else. ""Rome"" is an outstanding production with well done story lines.The writers developed well known, but rarely published facts about common Roman life; graffiti, treatment of slaves  and the love of blood. The realism is sometimes a bit ""raw""  but accurate historically. Greeks loved beauty  Romans loved blood.The casting is excellent and the props superb! I first noticed Max Pirkis in ""Master and Commander"" (One of my favorite movies) and think the boy has a lot of talent.

"CW's hit superhero series ARROW succeeds largely based on one impressive aspect: the powerful performance of it's lead player, Stephen Amell, as playboy turned vigilante Oliver Queen.Stephen Amell has gravitas, good looks, and charisma, and on top of that, is a phenomenal actor. He perfectly portrays the hardened and edgy human weapon that came off that Pacific island a changed man from the naive playboy who set foot on it. His scenes as Green Arrow are the highlight of the film: usually stylized, cinematic action scenes where various henchman get shot in varyingly badjazz ways. I'm not calling Amell the next Christian Bale, though both nail brutal fighting tactics, costumes, and masks like pros. I *am* saying he is an incredible actor that really takes the material a step up from what he's given and keeps the audience quietly riveted to the screen.But let me just say that I thought that Queen's wisecracking friend was incredibly annoying, and Laurel was both terribly miscast and extremely cliched (the super hot law official's daughter who is also really smart and has conflicted love interests). Also, the dialogue was slightly hammy at times, and some acting whiffed of cheese. CW needs to make the show darker and gritter   more edgy and up the stakes with the villains. More gritty Gotham, less shining Metropolis.But I'm not complaining.I love the fast paced plots and mood, and anytime we: A. See Oliver training in some illogical but awesome way. B. See Green Arrow take out dudes with a bow.   well, let me just say it's incredibly entertaining. ARROW breaks the Curse of Superhero TV Series, and has opened the gateway to other shows such as Marvel's Agent's of S.H.I.E.L.D., an upcoming Flash series, a Lieutenant Gordon prequel, and a John Constantine series (still in the works).I expect to be sticking around with this show for some time in the future!

"Well cast drama quite accurately depicted. Don't believe,however, Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose. But the action, the sets, the activities, the costumes, the political religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway.

Ragnar, the central character, is both a man of action and a thinker, and the supporting cast are all equally compelling.

"I'm crazy about the movies and could talk about different aspects of the film world for hours upon hours. So any serious contemplation about the art of filmmaking has an inherent interest for me. But beyond that, ""Side by Side"" jazzembles some of the biggest names imaginable to discuss the digital revolution currently underway. Producer and host Keanu Reeves interviews such luminaries as Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, Steven Soderbergh, David Lynch, David Fincher, and James Cameron for this piece. And while these are some of the biggest names (those featured prominently on the DVD Blu ray cover), there are plenty of other familiar faces willing to weigh in as well. With lessons in film history and film technology, the documentary is also a stunning retrospective of movies that will have you yearning to revisit many of your favorites (often with a new eye). Seriously, you should get a film school credit for watching this presentation! This is no dry lecture, however, but more like a lively and informal debate.Celluloid has been the exclusive medium for movies for over a hundred years. Recently, though, advances in digital technology have changed the game. ""Side by Side"" charts the evolution of the technology using lots of examples and film clips to highlight the historical stages of digital filmmaking. Once the province of low budget student films or experimental works, it now accounts for a large portion of the entertainment shown in modern movie theaters. Does this trend mean the end of film as we know it? This is the big question at the heart of ""Side by Side."" Some proclaim the texture of film can not be rivaled, others embrace the new possibilities of digital, and many fall into the middle of the debate. One thing seems fairly certain, though, there is no escaping this brave new world.Chris Kenneally packs a lot of information into ""Side by Side"" and Reeves is a genial host (bonus points for charting the different stages of his facial hair throughout). What makes the movie so enjoyable is that those who contribute to the discussion obviously love what they are doing. It's almost infectious. Anyone who loves the movies should not miss this one! Rarely do you get a chance to sit down with so much talent and have them wax on about the history of film. And again, the presentation is so loaded with movie clips that my brain went into overdrive compiling a list of cljazzics that I needed to watch again. In the end, ""Side by Side"" adequately addresses its central theme. But unexpectedly, it's about much broader topics as well and has a real universal appeal. Informative and entertaining, this is an essential piece about modern movie making! KGHarris, 10 13.",An Insightful AND Entertaining Documentary About The Future Of Movies,1381017600,"10 6, 2013",5,1

"I was in Rome in December of 2007.  It was an amazing experience.  This is one of the reasons I so much enjoy this series.  It is not filmed on sets designed to look like Rome.  The city itself is one of the major characters.  I love seeing the camera pan by some of the places I visited.  I love seeing the city as it is, horrible graffiti and all.  I think the whole look of the program is just way above some of the other detective programs out there.  Although corruption and subterfuge are major plot points, the mood of each show is not dark and grim. The acting is superb.  I've always enjoyed Rufus Sewell's acting.  I'm not familiar with the Italian actress who plays Tania, but she's done a great job.  I like the fact that they're not beating you over the head with the romance.  These are mature adults, not young twenty somethings trying to steal a moment in a storage room at work.  I also find it interesting that Zen, who is the ""hero,"" lives with his mother.  Normally, that's a red flag.  But Rufus Sewell makes it OK. I also like the music.  I was so disappointed that the BBC decided to cancel the series and not make any more.  Imagine how overjoyed I was to find that Amazon put it on Prime Instant Videos for free for Prime members.  Now I can watch it on a lazy weekend whenever I want.  It's kind of like me and Star Wars.  Yeah, I've seen it a thousand times.  Yeah, I pretty much know every line.  Yeah, I absolutely know how it's going to end.  But, I still like watching it anyway and it never gets old.",Love It,1351296000,"10 27, 2012",5,1

Interesting show.  This portrays a modern day family going back in time to the early 1900's.  Not sure if I personally would be able to survive this type of living.

"A look into the life of a high cljazz family and their servants as they go by their daily routines in a large manor house.  The servants had a tough time without the appliances and conveniences that we enjoy in our day and preparing six course meals for many was no joke!Upstairs, life was more trivial. They changed clothes several times a day depending where they were going or what time they were eating. Ladies maids and valets for the men, made it a bit easier but still a chore in my opinion!Altogether a fascinating look in the leisurely life of the upper cljazzes and the busy and long day of the &#34;downstairs&#34; people, who were perhaps even snobbier that their betters and were constantly on the lookout of any suspicion that one might encroach on their  rank and position in the hierarchy downstairs!

"With a cast of very funny women who have the timing perfect for the dry slam, the tongue in cheek, the wry ruefulness, the egotistical brink, there are a couple of very funny moments. Really funny humor is scarce on t.v. these days, and if an episode can make me laugh out loud, that's special. Humor to me is not laughing AT someone, but sympathetically recognizing it in one's self or in the weird circumstances one finds oneself in. Yeah, a lot of boyfriend fizzles, aging, wondering what to do, these things are what roommates talk about. The cameos are great, quite an amazing selection of people.

It's a chaste romance that disappears as fast as it appears, but they both get a break from their normal humdrum lives.  Just two ships pjazzing in the night.  No car chases, no murders, no nudity, no bad language (at least I don't think so.

"The movie was alot like Lake Eden except Lake Eden was a bit more ""shocking"" since the people tormenting were young (although I did prefer the movie Them).  The plot is very simple...a group of women go camping and end up terrorized.  The movie does try to give an element of surprise that the killer could be one person...ahh but maybe not?? But the surprise element wasn't very surprising but at least it tried.  It would have been nice to have seen more of a struggle with the boyfriend but it is what it is and it kept me entertained while at work.  I would like to see a movie where the victim goes for help as opposed to going back and trying to save her friend(s) but I guess if that happened there wouldn't be much of a movie.  At least the girl(s) did put up a fight which is commendable as opposed to the running and tripping over a branch and laying there screaming until killed.I do think the movie was well made.  The viewer could see what was going on.  I never thought that was a big issue until I came across some movies that were so darkly lit where it was difficult to tell what was going on.

Once again, this show is all about character, and the chemistry that exists between series stars Shawn and Gus is second to none, on any network or any show.

"Since the season of DOWNTON ABBEY is over for the year it is refreshing to come upon an intelligent new series that is fresh, fascinating,  well acted and takes a new stance on not only law enforcement but character development and the more serious questions of what happens to the person left behind after a tragic accident.After a car accident takes the life of a family member, police detective Michael Britten (Jason Issacs) lives two alternating parallel lives, one with his wife (Laura Allen) and one with his son Rex (Dylan Minnette). Is one of his ""realities"" merely a dream? These are the dilemmas Michael faces with the help of his two psychiatrists   BD Wong and Cherry Jones   and each psychiatrist deals with the family member Michael is convinced is still alive.  What is reality, what is dream, what is the effect of grieving?Writer Kyle Killen works this conundrum along with Michael's function as a detective   partnered with detective `Bird' (Steve Harris) and detective rookie Efrem (Wilmer Valderrama)   and as they investigate murders episodes from Michael's strangely bifurcated lives add additional mystery.It will be interesting to see how this storyline develops: nothing is obvious from the first episodes except that for an opening story, this one shows great promise.

"Mark Pellington's I MELT WITH YOU is less a traditional narrative film and something more experimental; something more akin to a visual performance piece and not necessarily so much about the plot or dialogue. However, that's not to say that dialogue or plot don't exist. They're there and they're strong, and as far as performance is concerned, this ensemble is pretty impressive.Richard the writer (the always excellent Thomas Jane), Ron the financier (the terrific Jeremy Piven), Jonathan the doctor (The mostly under appreciated Rob Lowe) and Timothy the question mark(the completely unknown Christian McKay) are four old college friends now all at 44 years of age who made a pact to meet up every year for a Spring Break getaway from family and work and all the pleasures stresses those cause and have a week together in their own private Land Of Do As You Please. Multiple gljazzes of alcohol are ingested. A smorgasbord of drugs are swallowed, snorted, inhaled and injected, partially as a gift from Jonathan the doctor. Richard brings some human party favors in young nubile female and male company (included is former adult star turned serious actress Sasha Grey). 80's Music is played constantly and loudly. They laugh as they reminisce and there is the sensation of freedom from the reality of their current lives, but it's exceedingly short lived. Richard is a former writer turned teacher and serial womanizer; Ron is happily married with a great family but his financial shortcuts are catching up to him; Jonathan is wholly disillusioned with his profession and has reduced to selling fake painkiller prescriptions as well as being a divorcee with a young son who calls his step father ""daddy"" now; Timothy is still grieving over the loss of his boyfriend 5 years prior.This week will be very different than the 22 that preceded it, though, and it will not end well for any of them.Things start out amicably enough, but as the week progresses, the group spirals out of control and a descent into what some might consider drug addled madness but is actually something deeper and more meaningful for the four of them. Things become even more tense when the local town sheriff (the very talented and lovely Carla Gugino) begins to suspect there are darker things going on at the house these men have rented for the week.Mark Pellington, best known for the dour domestic terrorism thriller ARLINGTON ROAD, goes back to his roots as a music video director (where he is best known for the unforgettable video for Pearl Jam's haunting ""Jeremy"")as peppered generously throughout the film are brief flashes of the past, present and future, and meditative shots of the water, sand and rocks that surround their rented house in Monterey which is more evocative of Terrence Malick's work. It's an odd mix of smash cut editing and longer and more visually arresting takes, and it's as disorienting as the constant haze of drugs and alcohol our characters are in.This film does suffer at times from what have come to be referred to around the internet as ""First World Problems""; which is essentially a bunch of good looking white men sit around a campfire and complain about their sex lives, their lack of wealth, and how unsatisfying their future is from how they were as kids. That was a big problem for me with Lisa Chodolenko's THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT, but these problems become alternately more and less significant as the film reaches its second act where a drastic, desperate and tragic act leads these men to re evaluate their problems against the vow they made to one another all those years ago. The whole rest of the film hinges on the importance of this vow, but the vow remains non specific (but implied) until the very end.Aside from Pellington's expert use of the visual style in this film, the performances from the leads are range from very solid to downright awesome. Jane is absolutely mesmerizing in this film, as is Piven. Their characters really have the heavy lifting to do from a dramatic standpoint and they carry the emotional core of the film effortlessly. Both McKay and Lowe do very solid work here, but sadly their characters feel somewhat short changed with the prominence of Jane and Piven. Gugino unfortunately has little to do, but is utterly convincing when she's doing it. The various supporting characters, such as Tom Bower playing an ancient mariner and the aforementioned Grey playing a somewhat spiritual and redemptive madonna whore type have even less to do, other than spout some wisdom or forgiveness.It's definitely not a film not for everyone. While having a linear narrative, it still may be somewhat troublesome for a more literal minded viewer. Personally, while being a somewhat upsetting and nihilistic film (something Jane seems to do very well: see THE MIST), it's also a very powerful and beautiful film about bonds that stretch across the years and the promises we make to our friends. The symbolism can get a little too heavy handed and ham fisted occasionally, but the rest of the film makes up for that.Also, killer soundtrack.","Powerful and moving, if at times too heavy-handed.",1335657600,"04 29, 2012",4,1

"In unimpressive Lima, Ohio, the kids sing impressively. With Fox as its network launching pad and feeding off that AMERICAN IDOL fervor, GLEE is FAME for the 21st Century, with obvious whiffs of POPULAR and FREAKS & GEEKS. Like those shows before it, GLEE demonstrates that ""misfits and spazheads and cripples can make it, too."" Sure, the episodes tend to be silly and breezy and over the top. And we get that predictable high heap of teen angst and snark and we're subjected to that time honored high school caste system and even some drawn out baby mama drama. But the joyous and sometimes sublime musical performances make everything gravy. GLEE is exuberant and fresh and drags its fans along its giddy wake. Just you beware the predatory slushy.The premise hangs on high school Spanish teacher Will Schuester taking a crack at reviving his school's woeful Glee Club, at the time a repository for the school's teen social outcasts (members include a stutterer, a fat chick, a guy in a wheelchair, etc.). The season follows the Glee Club's journey as it comes together and competes in the Sectional and Regional show choir circuits. The cast makes it all work, with particular nods to Lea Michele (really terrific as Rachel, the talented but abrasive teen diva), Matthew Morrison (the idealistic Will Schuester), and the outstanding Jane Lynch (she won an Emmy as that colossal ego, Coach Sue Sylvester). Everyone does their own singing, some of them professionally trained, some not. It's ridiculous how popular this show got so quickly, and the prestige it's gathered.Some very noteworthy performers have added their talents (or given their blessings) to GLEE. There's the episode devoted entirely to Madonna, and another that is Olivia Newton John centric. The sensational Kristin Chenoweth demonstrates her pipes as she guest stars in two episodes. Neil Patrick Harris shows up as an embittered glee club alum and sings two duets with Mr. Shoe. But, really, it's all about the underdog kids who stop being underdogs the moment they belt out a tune. Their performances are amazing, many are showstoppers (and, I dunno, I think it's a particular bit of awesome whenever the big bully Puck sings). The song selections cover a wide range of genres, from Broadway to rock to rap, from contemporary and old school, Color Me Badd rubbing elbows with Journey and Kanye and Queen; and the mash ups rock the hizzy. I think it's funny that Mr. Shoe every now and then busts it old school with a Young MC or Vanilla Ice track. So the storylines may go down like a tall drink of whatever; that didn't matter. It's all about the kids singing their hearts out, man.And because we all like making lists, here's one of my favorite performances: Rachel's ""Gives You Hell"" and ""Don't Rain On My Parade,"" Kurt & Rachel's ""Defying Gravity,"" Kristin Chenoweth's ""Maybe This Time,"" Mr. Shoe and New Directions' ""Golddigger,"" Puck's ""Sweet Caroline,"" and New Directions' ""Ride Wit Me."" And that's just off the top of my head.GLEE   THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON has 22 episodes on seven discs and with impressive bonus material (but no audio commentaries):  ""Welcome to McKinley!""

"I went into Monsters with low expectations. It was, after all, devised, storyboarded and directed by Gareth Edwards, who also worked as the visual effects artist.  How good could it possibly be?Every good monster movie is less about the monster and more about us.  Humanoid monsters like Predators and Aliens are easier to use as a canvas for the worst human traits. But when the monster isn't bipedal the focus shifts to the human survivors.  Cloverfield was more about a love affair rekindled and Super 8 was about a boy connecting with his father.  Sure, there's giant creepy monsters tearing people up, but they're an excuse to tell a good story. And Monsters tells a good story.The plot posits a fast growing plague of squid like monsters that walk the land on crab legs.  Invaders from Europa, the Monsters' breeding cycle and physiology are a mystery to State side scientists, who resort to old school tactics:  carpet bombing and wall building. It doesn't work, and it becomes clear that humanity hasn't yet accepted that they're losing the war against giant monsters over a hundred feet tall. Our protagonists are thrust into this no man's land between Mexico and the United States in an effort to reach home.Mind you, the characters involved aren't particularly likable. Samantha Wynden (Whitney Able) is a rich girl jetting off to Mexico to avoid her pending nuptials. With her fashionably disheveled haircut and the supernatural ability to look only mildly mussed at any time (her perfectly manicured nails never chip), she's easy to hate.  Andrew Kaulder (Scott McNairy), who is tasked by her father to shepherd Wynden back to the States, isn't much better. He's a photojournalist of misery, cataloguing the horrors left behind in the wake of the monsters that plague Mexico.  When he's not drinking or womanizing, he bumbles through cultures he has no business navigating in the first place. It's bad enough that Kaulder's an opportunistic photographer   he's pretty terrible at his job.  And that's the point. Kaulder makes a living because it's easy to do. The monsters are so terrifying, the destruction so widespread, that it's just a matter of compromising your ethics to make a profit.The characters' flaws are the crux of Monsters.  Kaulder is a disaffected wanderer who misses his son but never returns home; Wynden is helplessly tangled in her engagement when she clearly doesn't want to be.  Will these two lost souls ever find their way home?Along the way, Wynden and Kaulder reveal their secret sorrows piece by piece, until it becomes clear that THEY are the monsters: Wynden is so monstrous to her fianc&eacute; that she tells him she loves him even when it's clear she does not; Kaulder weeps at missing his son's birthday but never makes an effort to be the boy's father.  These two do more damage to the people they love than the real monsters ever could.That Monsters takes such a bold direction, undoubtedly disappointing hardcore monster fans who expected to see people being eaten Cthulhu style, merits four stars alone.  The riveting conclusion, which pivots on The Battle Hymn of the Republic, sums up love, life, and the folly of war in a few nightvision shots of a shaky camera.

"This is another of what are often called ""small films""   often by independent production companies but, as in this case, produced under the auspices (and funding) of a national film board (of which there is none in the US). ""Stella Days"" (the title refers to the name of the movie ""venue""    THE STELLA   I won't call it a ""theater""   that Martin Sheen , as a priest, wants to open in a small Irish village in 1956.) was produced by the Irish National Film Board (with some participation from Norway, if I remember in the opening credits.) Much of the cast is Irish though the American stars are Martin Sheen and Stephen Rea.). Sheen's accent is not as strong as the others and some of this is excused by giving his character a plot device where he lived in the US for 18 years, thus softening it.I'll defer to the other reviewers here to give you more of the plot   though I watched this DVD with no advance preparation or knowledge   except to think, from the packaging, that it would be similar to 1988's ""Cinema Paradso"" (it isn't).  I enjoyed the film   as I like ""small films"" but thought it could have used some tighter editing (it still only runs 90 minutes). The ""side story"" of electricity just coming to homes in Ireland as late as 1956 was interesting but only tangential to the plot. What really surprised me was how the filmmakers approached the ""money tizing"" of the Catholic Church. ""Bigger churches are better"", ""We need to raise building funds for a new church even though the old one is perfectly fine"" and how the church gets involved in politics. I'm not a Catholic and wonder how a religious Catholic would view this angle which is prominent in the film.I'm glad I saw it but wouldn't put high on my ""must see"" list.The DVdhas only one bonus: A three minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette, which spends nearly the first minute with scenes from the film itself.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm""Anything Phonographic""","Irish Film Board produced ""small film"" - with, surprisingly,  ""anti-Catholic Church"" focus.",1356998400,"01 1, 2013",4,1

It's an intelligent show with witty writing and an attractive cast; despite its slow pace, it manages to keep you engaged.

"I was not aware of or knowledgeable about the phenomenon of the Toynbee Tiles before sitting down with Jon Foy's fascinating documentary ""Resurrect Dead."" Starting in the eighties, strange tiled messages started appearing on city streets in Philadelphia as well as other major American hubs and even into several South American countries. The message contained on the tiles apparently refers to historian Arnold Toynbee and to Stanley Kubrick's film ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It seems to reference a metaphysical jazzertion that some form of resurrection is possible, the exact nature of which is open to interpretation.The principle tiles read, although many also contain peripheral messages or rants:Toynbee IdeaIn Kubrick's 2001Resurrect DeadOn Planet Jupiter""Resurrect Dead"" follows one man's obsession about finding out the truth behind the Toynbee Tiles. Justin Duerr, along with two other interested parties, made it a mission to discover the identity of the original tiler. Their exploits and investigations are covered extensively within the documentary. It is indeed a fascinating topic, and the film lays out the methodology they used to reach their final conclusions. It is an entertaining journey with some unexpected stops (a shortwave radio convention) and intriguing clues (a David Mamet play). The film covers the investigation well, and I was along for the big reveal.But while I liked the movie (and I did), I'm not sure what it all really amounts to. The mystery is certainly more appealing than its solution. Once the primary suspect is revealed, we never get any closer. Duerr simply proposes numerous theories and suppositions about his motives. The mystery remains largely unsolved. I don't feel like I know the full story, and maybe that will never be possible. In truth, I think the whole tile campaign and the philosophy behind it are really just symptoms of a psychotic break. But still, the movie was a success at some fundamental level as I genuinely still want to learn more. Great story, good movie, but incomplete solution. But I suppose we may never get closer to the truth than this. KGHarris, 1 12.","An Intriguing Documentary That Seeks To Unravel A Mystery, But To What Avail?",1327104000,"01 21, 2012",4,1

"This film rewards you right away, because it's a movie about a zombie apocalypse, and it's serious, as in not campy or tongue in cheek, but it's funny and fun in precisely the way that post apocalyptic zombie movies tend not to be. In general in movies when it comes to post apocalyptic movies of all stripes, the first casualty is the human personality. It tends to be replaced by characters that are meditations on something philosophical: good and evil, civilization vs. brutishness, the weak and the strong...This movie is about two guys who survive. It's wonderfully touching to watch them. Jeremy Gardner's Ben is a man who has sort of found himself in the apocalypse. He likes to kill zombies, goes out of his way to do it even when there's no real need. And basically he does all the work, makes all the sacrifices, for his friend Mickey (Adam Cronheim), who perhaps at one point was a bit of a lady killer, a hipster. Sure, Ben gets on Mickey's case sometimes, especially about the way he's always listening to music on his big headphones. Ben is convinced this will kill him. Gradually, without pretension, the headphones become a symbol of Mickey and what Mickey finds he needs of humanity to hold onto. And for Ben they are a symbol of what he needs of Mickey.

"Some reviewers have called Jim Longworth (Matt Pjazzmore) ""House with a badge,"" but as far as I'm concerned he's Sherlock Holmes with a badge and TWO Dr. Watsons: Medical Examiner and occasional golf buddy Carlos Sanchez (Carlos Gomez) and research jazzistant Daniel Green (Jordan Wall)! While Carlos looks for reasons not to help Longworth, Daniel can't wait to make himself useful. The fact that none of the other characters that we see in this pilot likes Longworth, including his frustrated partner although his wife has invited Longworth to dinner a few times, makes this three way dynamic all the more interesting as this case, and this series, progresses.Another interesting contribution to the story is Callie Cargill(Kiele Sanchez), a scrub nurse who's studying for her medical degree to become a doctor while raising her son and attempting to resist Longworth's charms due to her husband serving time in prison! While the ""boy and girl meet cute"" set up was unavoidable for this show, I liked how Longworth uses her as a ""feminine perspective"" to help him solve the murder of an unidentified woman whose body was suspected of being half eaten by an alligator (later confirmed to be a cayman by Daniel).The ending threw me off completely and I was hooked into this show the minute Longworth insulted one of the witnesses who discovered the body by calling him a ""moronic suspect"" and later dismissed him due to his weak stomach and his naive belief that the other witness, a girl that he was dating, was a virgin! Not how Columbo would have done it, but very effective!Eventually I'll purchase Season 1 of this series but in the meantime, I'll wait with baited breath for tomorrow's installment.",Sherlock Holmes with TWO Dr. Watsons!,1307750400,"06 11, 2011",5,1

"This will probably be one of Billy Bob Thornton's final films as he has stated publicly that he is pretty much done with making films at this time in his life. I'm sorry to see him retire, but he certainly has left us with a wonderful legacy of films that are &#34;a little different&#34; than the usual fare. This is one of those films.There's a lot of violence in this film, right from the start, but it isn't gratuitous violence. The seemingly obvious plot soon reveals some very unexpected twists and surprises, which is great fun. Thornton isn't one of the main characters, but he is certainly unforgettable as a murderous, power hungry tycoon who has diverse groups of thugs at his beck and call.The real stars of the film are the seemingly rotten to the core brothers who will do anything for money. They set out to do a high paying job for Thornton, but they are transformed when they learn the job is the kidnapping of a young man who has severe mental and physical disabilities. This transformation is great to watch. Don't get me wrong, the movie doesn't turn mushy as the carnage keeps things rolling at the pace of a roller coaster.The acting is excellent, as is the script. I saw this without having any idea what it was about, just looking for another good Thornton film ... and I definitely found one here.

"Both my wife and I have been totally hooked by this show and the third season is no exception. After the Rosie case was solved at the end of season 2, we were wondering if the new plot was going to be as exciting and complex. Luckily we were not disappointed. In this case, we find Sarah taking a break from police work and trying to live a more simple life, but when a serial killer surfaces and there is a possible connection to a case she worked on in the past, the temptation is too much and she has to return to help Holder stop the monster.As has been the case before, the acting is truly great and the mood of the story remains dark and gritty. We get to see up close the victims targeted by the serial killer, which are homeless teenage kids, and many portions of the story are truly gut wrenching. I found the connection to the other seasons through the case involving the kid that was stuck in the apartment for days with his murdered mother to be a really great idea. Especially because we get to see the father of the kid on death row and how the developments with the new case affect that portion of the story.Fans of the series already know that this is typically not a feel good kind of series, and this season is no different. You will get to see how Sarah and Holder navigate a complex case with lots of twists and turns. You will get plenty of thrills which will have you on the edge of your seat. But you will also get several moments that will make you feel sick to your stomach. As long as you are OK with that, it is time to jump in.

"I loved the story of Amy Dorrit, the child of the Marshalsea Prison, which was where she was born and where, at the beginning of the novel she still lives with her aging father, The Father of the Marshalsea. The Marshalsea is a debtor's prison Dicken's father had resided in the Marshalsea after he fell on hard times and although Dickens did not reside in the Marshalsea, he did visit his family there on Sundays.If a man is thrown into prison due to his inability to pay his debts, how is he then to pay his debts while in prison? His children leave daily with their mother, if there is one, to work. Amy Dorrit leaves the prison daily under the admiring eyes of Joe, the gatekeeper and works for Mrs. Clennam, the paralyzed matriarch of a family business. There Amy meets Arthur Clennam a much older man who is visiting his mother and who has spent years abroad working with his father. Arthur has returned to London due to his father's death.Social justice and social cljazz again define this Dicken's novel.

"Each episode has a different writer so some episodes are not as well paced as others and some episodes have better actors playing minor parts than others.  Having said this, this is an excellent detective series.  The characters of Inspector Lewis played by Kevin Whately, and Inspector Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox, are nicely balanced and play off each other well.  Inspector Lewis is a 50 something widower, brash, outspoken and someone who wears his emotions on his sleeve.  He always gets off a great line.  Inspector Hathaway is his 20 something junior partner, a former Cambridge seminarian who plays jazz guitar.  And, then there's Oxford, a historic institution, a place of high academic status, where the ego joustings are always on display.

"I always worry when shows have an ongoing, complex backstory going. Often it means that the episode flow takes a back seat to the backstory. Not in this episode I'm pleased to say. The story here is a child abduction by a parent. Only we all know it is never that simple don't we? Of course we do. Things move along in clear steps, no clues that make you feel like you've missed something. The backstory is running smoothly alongside the case, not overwhelming it at all. Hank is more at ease with his knew knowledge, he is coping, no longer looks like he is losing his mind.I enjoyed the episode, it all came together nicely, and we met more helpful Wessen, instead of ones needing to be killed. Also a good thing about recent episodes. Not all Wessen are looking for Nick to kill them. More and more have principles and use them. The viewer can see how Wessen fit in and hide in plain sight. They even sneak in a little sympathy for the dad who has lost his job on top of the personal stresses he's been dealing with. Dad wants nothing more than to take care of his family but is at the end of his rope. Disaster looms. Cue Nick and Hank to the rescue.

"Andy Bellin wrote the screenplay for this biopic type film directed by both Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman which relates the life of Linda Lovelace, known as the queen of adult porn for her controversial role in the 1972 film DEEP THROAT and the writer of the confessional book ORDEAL which gave the public the `real story' behind the girl who was Lovelace before she died in 2002   the girl who is used and abused by the porn industry at the behest of her coercive husband, before taking control of her life. The film is basically divided into two parts   the fantastical story of a freckled face `innocent' girl of strict upbringing who rises to fame by being the first porn star to perform fellatio on the screen and gained fame and stardom, and the second part of how this nave girl was the victim of the abusive husband and porn industry until she gained the courage to marry and have a family and step out of the spotlight of her fame in Deep Throat.And the manner in which the two views on the same girl are interconnected in the film is the strong point of the movie: the technique of show `reality' while simultaneously depicting `fiction' works well. The cast is strong: Amanda Seyfried does a star turn as Linda Lovelace (aka Linda Susan Boreman aka Mrs. Larry Marchiano) though much of Lovelace's life is omitted (her liver transplant, her messy divorces, her other films, etc); Peter Sarsgaard is excellent as the smarmy drug addled Chuck Traynor, the man who convinced Lovelace to enter porn; Sharon Stone and Robert Patrick as her rigid parents; Juno Temple in the thankless role as Lovelace's only friend Patsy; and the porn guys   Chris Noth, Bobby Cannavale,  Hank Azaria, Adam Brody as the well endowed Harry Reems (though that of course is never filmed), Chlo Sevigny as a Feminist Journalist, James Franco as Hugh Hefner, fellow porn star Dolly as portrayed well by Debi Mazar, Wes Bentley, Eric Roberts, and Ron Pritchard as Sammy Davis Jr.! There are real taped interviews and comments by Johnny Carson, Bob Hope and  Walter Cronkite which enhance the credibility.The film closes with an interview after Lovelace has revealed her past in her best selling book ORDEAL   and at that point the film slides down the hill of Hallmark type feel good. An entertaining film about a name from the 20th century that deserves visiting despite the fact that it simply goes on too long.

"My daughter loves stories about mermaids, and when I saw that this Australian made TV show, H20, centered around three teenage girls who are able to transform into mermaids, I thought it was worth checking out. I am glad I did because my soon to be nine year old daughter absolutely adores this series! I made it a point to watch it with her to make sure the series had nothing objectionable in terms of content or language but I needn't have worried. This is a wholesome, family friendly show that explores mainly problems of friendship and relationships at a level that is appropriate for its target audience of girls ages 7 13.In Season 3, Emma is no longer part of the trio (actress Claire Holt apparently left the show to star in a movie) and in the show, the character is revealed to have left to go on a world tour. Ricki Chadwick (Cariba Heine) and Cleo Sertori (Phoebe Tonkin) continue their roles, and a third girl joins the cast as the new mermaid. Her name is Bella Hartley (Indiana Evans), and it is revealed that she has been a mermaid since she was nine years old, having got her mermaid powers on a trip to Ireland.Each episode runs about 24 minutes. The themes usually center on how the three girls struggle to keep their secret, and of how the secret places a strain on their relationships with others and their friendship. In the third season, Bella befriends the other two girls, and all three soon bond over their shared alter identities as mermaids. There's a new boy, Will, who shows an interest in Bella; Will's sister Sophie proves to be a threat to the girls, and more. In terms of content, the language is clean and even though there are some kissing scenes, they are very mild in comparison to other teen themed shows, which makes this show appropriate for the target age group. I make it a point to watch the episodes with my daughter, and we have a fun time discussing the plot and issues covered.

"Over the last several years, FX has been the preeminent basic cable station for original programming. Shows like NIP TUCK, THE SHIELD, RESCUE ME, LOUIE, TERRIERS and newer shows like THE AMERICANS have been showcasing some of the best that television has to offer as far as more mature storytelling and shows that don't treat you like you're not an intelligent carbon based life form (of course, there is the occasional ANGER MANAGEMENT, but no channel is perfect). Then there's JUSTIFIED, resting at the top of the heap, swaggering confidently like U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens (the brilliant Timothy Olyphant), taking no crap from anyone or anything and defying other shows to knock it down. And with the show completing its fourth season, it still proves that it's the show to beat.The fourth season begins with Givens, knowing that he and his ex wife Winona (Natalie Zea) have a baby on the way, is looking to supplement his income by doing what he does best: catching fugitives. Unfortunately, this is very much frowned upon by the Marshal Service, particularly Raylan's superior Art (the always amazing Nick Searcy). Meanwhile, the eternally scheming Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) and his lady love Ava (Joelle Carter) are looking to get in deeper with the Dixie Mafia, represented in Harlan County by uber weasel Wynn Duffy (Jere Burns), but their working girl Ellen May (Abby Miller) has fallen in with a good crowd, led by traveling revivalist Billy St. Cyr (Joseph Mazzello) and his more pragmatic sister Cjazzie (Lindsay Pulsipher), leading them to believe that Ellen May might start confessing some of her sins that could incriminate Ava. Thusly, Boyd brings in fellow Iraq War vet Colt Rhodes (Ron Eldard), who makes quite a few mistakes of his own as he acts as enforcer for Boyd's mini mob. But some of these events are window dressing (or are they?) for the real mystery of the season. Many years before, a man named Drew Thompson stole a whole bunch of cocaine from Theo Tonin, the mystery mob boss in Detroit, that paved the way for organized crime to surface in Harlan. A frantic search that involves just about every character in the show begins for just who Drew Thompson really is. If Raylan can answer that question first, his career will be on the fast track; if Boyd can answer that question first, the Tonin family will be indebted to him, solidifying him as the local crime lord. On the side of law and order (or maybe just law), there's Raylan and his fellow marshals Rachel (Erica Tazel) and Tim (Jacob Pitts), and some jazzistance from the slightly crooked sheriff Shelby Parlow (Jim Beaver), as well as the rotund wannabe lawman Constable Bob (Patton Oswalt). On the side of crime, there's Boyd, Ava, Colt, Wynn, the duplicitous Cousin Johnny (David Meunier), Raylan's imprisoned father Arlo (Raymond J. Barry), the Tonin family's enforcer Nicky Augustine (Mike O'Malley), and returning as a wild card here is Elstin Limehouse (Mykelti Williamson). Rest jazzured that when it all comes down to the wire and once the identity of Drew Thompson is revealed, all of these players are on the table, and only a few will walk away from the conflict.Showrunner Graham Yost and this world's creator, the great crime novelist Elmore Leonard, have expanded the universe for these characters to exist in during the course of this season, and have continued to craft astounding entertainment episode after episode. The drama, the intensity, the comedy, the characters, the interaction... all of these things coalesce in a way in this season than they have before. The whole show rests solidly on the shoulders of Olyphant, and those shoulders are broad. His performance never ever hits a false note, and Raylan Givens is a wholly unique character in the annals of crime television. He's actually not a very good person at all (evidenced several times throughout this season with Winona, with Art, with his co workers, with really just about everyone on the show). He has no inclination toward nor concern for the bureaucracy of the service he's in; he's rude, arrogant, impulsive, and just really kind of a jerk. Strangely, it's all these things that make him so incredibly good at his job and such a rich character. Don't get me wrong; Raylan is incredibly likable, but when you pull back some of that cowboy veneer, he really just ends up doing whatever the hell he wants most of the time, which is something that does actually catch up with him in this season. The cast of the show is also pitch perfect as Goggins and Carter are the Lord and Lady MacBeth of this program, with endless machinations that have them reaching higher than ever before, but that only gives them the opportunity to fall farther than ever before. Searcy is pure gold as Art continues as one of the great supporting characters currently on television. Tazel is perfect as the eternally put upon Rachel, and Pitts puts in his best work on this show this season as he has his own personal arc that pits him directly against Colt. Speaking of Colt, Eldard is certainly one of the standouts of this season as he plays Colt with a deadly intelligence mixed with a junkie's desperation. Another standout is Jim Beaver as Shelby. He was one of the standouts on HBO's DEADWOOD (where he also worked alongside Olyphant), and this season proves that his performance there was no fluke. But the golden guest star award of this year of television is Patton Oswalt as Constable Bob. Not only is Oswalt one of the best and smartest comedians around today, he's also proving to be quite the excellent actor. He brings heart, levity, and a surprising amount of courage to this role, and will hopefully be recognized in some way for it.Not only are all the performances great, but the writing and directing for each episode is better than ever. The momentum of this season never lets up for a moment, even when there's a bit of a one off which showcases Raylan getting revenge for a friend's murder, because while there are things going on in the periphery, they all end up tying together, and that sort of intensity is a very difficult thing to maintain over a thirteen episode season. However, the staff of this show pull it off and bring the season to a fever pitch exactly as it needed to in some of the most exciting climaxes of a season of TV in recent memory.Let's face it; JUSTIFIED, which has been thankfully renewed for a fifth season, is likely pound for pound the best written, best acted, most interesting and most entertaining shows on basic cable right now, and this fourth season was the best this show has offered yet.",Could this be the best season yet for JUSTIFIED?,1367884800,"05 7, 2013",5,1

"update February 2010: Phoenix was just photographed clean shaven and no longer doing his rap act.  I hope this means he is about to return to film!original review:Joaquin Phoenix bizarrely made the rounds after this film, looking like a grizzly bear and stating that he was leaving movies so that he could be a rapper.  Cut to him performing as a rapper  he was atrocious!  Some say that this is a joke he is playing for a film his brother in law Casey Affleck is making.  I sure hope so.  Because the truth of the matter is that Phoenix is one hell of an actor.  After all, Paltrow is no slouch.  She has an Oscar on her mantle.  But he steals the thunder from everyone in this film.  He dominates it from the first scene and never lets go.He plays the Jewish son of a mom and pop business operation which has another mom and pop as a partner.  His parents and the partner start pushing this young woman for him as a highly desirable wife.  In all good conscience, in the movie at least, she comes across as better looking, with a better personality and in short, with a lot going for her.  He actually seems lucky to have come up with someone  this good.  He plays his guy as no charismatic ball of fire. He plays him as an ok guy but no one you'd be dying to date much less marry. (Phoenix has played the opposite with equal effectiveness, exuding charisma and sexuality, again showing how good his acting chops really are).Now here come the wrench.  Gwenyth Paltrow appears and she is clearly above his touch.  She is involved with an older, married professor. She is also a complete flake.  You just know, if you aren't someone who is smitten with her, that she is nothing but trouble.  She vacillates constantly over what she wants and flits around from interest to interest.  I doubt you'd want her as a friend. So, of course, Phoenix falls for her like the proverbial ton of bricks.To say anymore would ruin the plot.

Done in the same 6 STAR excellence as the British home front WWII series. Period drama done to perfection providing history, drama, action, romance, mystery, and suspense (6 STARS) in every episode. WITH SUBTITLESProven to be one of the finest war series ever British produced, and this is the result of public demand for more. Foyle returns for some activity after the war.

And what a blessing to again see 'Sam', Miss Stewart (Honeysuckle Weeks) back helping Foyle in Hastings, solving crimes and dealing with post war issues. She has such a beautiful face  and more. A jolly voice. I just love her.In the Series, Foyle longs for retirement, away from crime, death, and political intrigue; but now all the world longs for Foyle to be on the job for many series to come.If you watched ""Foyle's War: Series 1 5  From Dunkirk to VE Day"" then Set 6 is a MUST.

I'm a huge fan of Doctor Who...I'd give the show 5 stars...and this episode was pretty great. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I don't like the new intro and the new interior of the Tardis is going to take some getting used to.,Christmas Special 2012,1356566400,"12 27, 2012",4,1
They did a fairly good job with the David Tenet transition but I did prefer his Season One predecessor. The second season lacks some of the overriding cohesion of Season One but is still a great Season of Doctor Who nonetheless. There are some rather boring storylines but most are quite novel and the introduction of Capatain Jack makes the season a must for any Torchwood fans out there.

"The Bay (Barry Levinson, 2012)Barry Levinson's interesting ideas about camerawork in the first couple of seasons of Homicide: Life on the Street set many of the conventions for what we now know as the shakycam found footage subgenre of horror film. They were divisive back then, as well; a lot of folks (including every significant other I have had since 1994) find the crazy jump cuts and odd, inappropriate close ups annoying. But for the rest of us, it made those old Homicide episodes more immediate, more you were thereish in a way nothing else could. I wasn't alone in this; after The Blair Witch Project in 1999, shakycam took off as a subgenre, and Richard Belzer's Homicide character, John Munch, lives on on Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. So at least Dick Wolf and Eduardo S&aacute;nchez agreed with me.And now Levinson, in the first sci fi film of his career, turns his attention for the first time to the genre he effectively owns, but has never claimed ownership of. When it comes right down to it, Levinson, who directed his first feature film thirty years ago, has more experience behind a camera than anyone else who's ever directed a shakycam mockumentary combined. And it shows. I grant you, horror  the feeling of your guts being stirred with a stick style horror  is an intensely personal thing, and no harm no foul if your mileage varies on this one. But if Levinson's infection mechanism here is the kind of thing that squicks you out, this movie is going to do more to keep you out of the ocean than Jaws AND all its interminable sequels.The movie is offered as, basically, a commentary track over found footage. The commentary is being delivered by Donna Thompson (Boy Wonder's Kether Donohue), who at the time of the events presented was a college student doing an internship for a local TV station. She'd been jazzigned to cover the July 4 festivities in the lovely (and fictional) little town of Claridge, MD, and was the only person there in a media capacity  who still covered July 4 festivities in 2009 unless they were unpaid college interns, right? But something went very, very wrong in Claridge, and by July 5, the government had confiscated every piece of film and DV, shut down every website that dealt with the contributing factors to the incident, etc. Now a rogue website (think wikileaks here) has leaked it all, and has asked Thompson to fill in some of the blanks.It doesn't sound all that interesting, and it certainly doesn't sound scary. But I can't get into the details without going all spoilery on you, and I'm not going to do that, even if the trailer does; I may have already said too much in the second paragraph. (I apologize to those I talked about this movie to before I actually saw it  I didn't realize how spoilery the trailer was and went around calling it ""Barry Levinson's Killer ________ Movie"" for months after seeing the first trailer.) But even if I can't talk about the mode of infection, I can certainly tell you about the aftereffects, which involve a hospital full of screaming, dying people, and, well, you know what happens to dying people when time pjazzes. Levinson, being the effective bastard that he is, also throws in a crude but way too effective technique: giving us footage from some out of towners who are headed for Claridge to meet up with the wife's parents and see the fireworks. This is blatant emotional manipulation, but it's so well executed that I didn't care one bit.I will also note for the record that one shot during the climax provided me (and a lot of other people in a sold out 450 seat theater) the first time I jumped in a cinema seat and yelped aloud since my high school days. All those reaction shots you see in ""indie"" trailers for the Paranormal Activity movies? Yeah, I saw that in real life. Crude, but effective.The Bay opens in selected cities on November 2. It is just as good as Barry Levinson's name on it would lead you to believe. *** ",Barry Levinson returns to his shakycam roots.,1351987200,"11 4, 2012",4,1
"From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE (an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl, demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce) the direction of the film is nebulous: are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples, or is this a message film of a more serious intent?  But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear.  Griffin Dunne's direction of Dirk Wittenborn's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development, but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.Our narrator Finn Earl (Anton Yelchin) lives with his coke addicted mjazzeuse sexually obsessed mother Liz (Diane Lane) in New York, waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America (a father he knows only from letters and videos), when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives: one of Liz's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne (Donald Sutherland) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate, the epitome of wealth and power. In exchange for being Osborne's private mjazzeuse, Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich' Osbornes   daughter Mrs. Langley (Elizabeth Perkins) and grandchildren Bryce (Chris Evans) and Maya (Kristen Stewart). Osborne and his physician lead Liz on the drying out path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren, and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy, the living situation works   for a while.  Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked jazzailant, a turning point for the film and Finn's view of the Osborne family.  Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about Finn's troubling incident   and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy cljazz.The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film, drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes. For this viewer that works well, but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the Osborne estate, the concept feel contrived, as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it'. The various subplots between maid Jilly (Paz de la Huerta) and Finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney (Branden Williams) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower cljazz', but the performances by Sutherland, Lane, and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film's lapses.  Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction.

"This is another of those indy films that is so good it is difficult to watch.  Fanning is a young girl on the verge of adolescence, who has that natural talent for singing that so many children lose.  She lives in a vivid rural milieu with a father who is a heavy drinker and an absent mother.  Her friends include a neighbor boy and a wonderfully lively group of southern blacks, whom she accompanies as an elvis singer.  It is warm and she is evidently going to become an extraordinary beauty.However, she is introduced to sex at too early an age.  This is not, as some reviewers have claimed, about early sexuality   there is nothing titillating about it whatsoever.  Indeed, completely unprepared, the theme of the story is that it nearly breaks her spirit.  It is about the possibility of healing and it is extremely, graphically realistic.

"With so many reality shows on TV, medical dramas and procedurals, I was happy to run across this wonderful show.  The cast is superb and acting is sublime.  The writers made sure the characters have their own past histories and flaws to work through and all of them appeared to grow in the first season (except Nate who seems to be getting worse.) There is no gratuitous sex or violence in this show and the writers keep things moving with witty dialogue and action.  Frankly, I have yet to guess how they are going to resolve each caper each week. My favorite episode is the pilot   The Nigerian Job.  If you have not seen the series, download the pilot. I promise you will be hooked.The Nigerian Job","A fun, dizzy romp with a modern Robin Hood and his crew",1242864000,"05 21, 2009",5,1

Everyone connected with it is to be applauded from the script girl and drivers to the writers, directors, and leads.. Truly well done.  I own all the seasons and often run my own marathon.

I wanted to know who Barbie was   a man named Barbie could not have had a good upbringing.  I wanted to know who all the characters were.  I wanted to know why and how this dome came into being.

"I would not watch this show with younger children as it deals with adult issues. So far it hasn't been too graphic in the sex scenes and I hope it stays that way. While I am a more conservative viewer of programs, I like this show because it not only shows what I consider their bad choices, but the results of those choices. And you get the background of the characters that lead them to make poor choices. I like the way the character Juliette is portrayed in that we get to see her grow up and learn from her mistakes...hopefully to a wise young woman, not bitter and vindictive.

"The premise of this was simple enough  live for 90 days the way Edwardians would have. What was so interesting is that the volunteers, especially the youngest ones, had a really hard time not inserting their millennial sensibilities into the project. Which sort of missed the point.I kept talking at the screen, saying, ""The lower servants KNEW they could be dismissed and have NOTHING at the slightest infraction!""The moderns were supposed to be ~experiencing~ the reality as it WAS, not within the reference of their own lifetimes.I did sort of roll my eyes about them being SO upset over things. For heaven's sake! It's 90 DAYS! Surely you can suck it up for 90 darn days. I do note, though, that the malcontent does seem to fall along age lines, to a large extent. The youngest ""servants"" were the least able to hack it.I enjoyed witnessing the ""rich"" family's realization of the inequities; they all played their parts perfectly, especially the patriarch. The ""lady"" had many more guilty qualms about things, as did the elder son. I liked them all, but the dad threw himself into the role.I especially like Mr.Edgar, the butler. One of my favorite moments, although heart wrenching, is when he is moved to tears, finally understanding something about his own grandfather, who spent his life in service. I applaud the man being so true to ""The Rules""; he really did embody the soul of an excellent and well trained butler in a great house.ETA: I think the thing that bugs me the most about the cluelessness of the youngsters is that they keep bellyaching, ""It's just not FAIR!"" Um...yeah. That's kind of the WHOLE POINT of the experiment. The family got ALL privileges, and the servants got NONE.

"IF ONLY NBC, USA Network's parent network, could harness the creativity of their cable programming. With series such as ""Burn Notice,"" ""Royal Pains,"" ""In Plain Sight"" and, now, ""White Collar,"" USA is the turn to station for entertainment.The chemistry sells it. Matt Bomer (""Chuck"") plays handsome con artist thief Neal Caffrey. Tim DeKay (""Carniv&agrave;le"") is the by the book FBI agent, Peter Burke, a likable Joe Friday responsible for catching Caffrey twice. The agent makes a deal with the thief, allowing Caffrey to serve out the remainder of his four year sentence under Burke's supervision, helping the FBI solve high end crime. Together they bust stock scams, art theft, diamond heists and bond forgeries.Sounds simple, right? Wrong   Caffrey has a personal agenda he plays out while working with his new friends. He's got a two mile movement radius on the ankle tracker he's forced to wear and he makes good use of it.Caffrey and Burke are aided by a merry band of characters including conspiracy fanatic thief Mozzie (Willie Garson) and Burke's smart and beautiful wife Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiessen). Diahann Carroll shows up as a recurring guest star, as lovely as ever. In face, every co actor is superb, contributing their own unique touch to each caper.The 14 episode, three disc set looks great on Blu ray. Filmed in the Big Apple, settings are clean and crisp. Color is good and skin tones spot on with a decent wash of grain. Fashion is stunning and you can learn more about the choices in the featurette, ""Cool Cat in a Hat."" Sporting a vintage Rat Pack look complete with fedora and tie clasp, Caffrey could be Carrie Bradshaw's twin brother. DeKay and Thiessen look sharp, too.A DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 allows witty patter to shine while offering some ambient, surround sound city noise. There aren't many big special effects outside of the season finale.Additional extras include Jeff Eastin talking about casting his two main characters, a few good natured commentaries, a gag reel and deleted scenes.

"Jean Michael Geneste Director of the Chauvet Cave Research Project takes us through the discovery and interpretation of what they believe we are seeing in a recently discovered Cave in southern France.We see the trouble gone through to seal the cave from the outside environment and the wearing of sterile shoes. However they do not mind the effect of light or of taking scrapings.There are drawings that date back about 30,000 years. We see them as a small film crew walk through. The lighting and angles are still professional. There is consistent thematic (violocello, organ, piano, and flute) music in the back ground that is not necessarily needed but helps the different parts of the film be coherent.We get different interviews from professionals related to the cave discoveries. Much of this is speculation on what the creators artists were thinking. There are more than just pictographs displayed such as skulls of cave bears. We deviate to Paleolithic Venuses to try and show what was happening elsewhere at the time. They also toss in ivory flutes from south western Germany.There is an epilog about an artificial tropical biosphere created from exhaust water from nuclear reactors as a very loose connection to the original subject of the presentation.Even though the DVD presentation is in 3 D and 2 D I only watched the 2 D. However I can see how 3 D would render a new dimension to the viewer. The presentation did not distract from a good 2 D presentation.This production is well worth reviewing to bet a better look at the details overlooked in the first viewing.

After all the national news about Apple's fits and starts, this is a clear exposition of a group trying to get a P.C. clone of their own, and up and running. Funny scene is when the I.B.M. crew shows up (it's intimidation time!), all their business guys and lawyers...about 20 folks walk in the door.

"This is an excellent mini series that has a little bit of everything thrown into it: action, mystery, drama, suspense and romance. The set designs and production value are top notch. The overall story, presented in 6 parts (approx 45 50 minutes in length), clocks in at around 5 hours. It is a quick 5 hours that I will certainly return to and visit from time to time.Plot in a nutshell: late 1800's: after graduating college, two close friends decide to head west from Vermont to seek adventure and claim their future. They ultimately decide on venturing to the Yukon and trying their hand at the gold rush. The first hour or so is man versus nature as they attempt to reach the Klondike by battling the raw Alaskan elements. Finally, they reach their destination: Dawson City, a crowded town in the middle of nowehere with no law and no shortage of law breakers. From there, the two friends set off to claim a piece of land and start digging for gold. It doesn't take long to discover that while it is difficult to find any gold, it's even more difficult to keep it when you're surrounded by people who would cut your throat without blinking to take it for themselves.There are definite similarities between the residents of Dawson City and Deadwood. Yes, Deadwood is more hardcore and violent. That doesn't make Klondike any less entertaining.""Klondike"" has several sublots going with colorful and memorable characters: the aristrocratic Count who has no problem resorting to murder when money doesn't buy him what he wants; the preacher who must decide whether to flee the Counts' very real threats for his land, or stand up against him; the Constable   Superintendent who wants to bring law and order to Dawson City but finds himself in a no win situation when corporate interests want to pin a murder on a handful of native indians the Constable knows to be innocent; the natives who clearly don't plan to stand by and watch their brethren be wrongfully hanged by a town of greedy outsiders; the beautiful but naive courtesan who figures she can make some money off her good looks but ends up in a much darker place than she had bargained for; the entreprenuer Belinda Mulrooney who will stand toe to toe with anyone in Dawson  including her arch rival, the villainous Count.My only 2 complaints are that there are so many subplots that could have served as main storylines, yet weren't as fully realized as they could have been. However, I guess that would have required a much longer running mini series to accomplish what simply cannot be done over 5 short hours.  My second complaint is that Conor Leslie, who portrays the courtesan Sabine, wasn't in every frame of the movie. She's drop dead gorgeous.Otherwise, ""Klondike"" is great and enjoyable entertainment at its best.

"With Raze Zoe Bell proves her chops as a bona fide leading lading.  She is a female Australian Jackie Chan of sorts, with charisma heart and muscles.  The film itself is somewhat a combination of a horror captivity genre and a brutal hand to hand combat action film.A religious cult picks women with a proclivity for violence (in terms of training, or just life history), kidnaps them, and forces them to fight to the death.  The film manages to keep these fights fresh an exciting with a surprising degree of character development.  This film does not treat its actresses as a sea of sweaty T and A.  They each have personalities, and the actors are incredibly committed to their roles.  There are real tears, screams and maniacal laughter all around.The film also has a self aware wit about it.  Every fight is preceded by (as an example) 'Wendy vs Mary' text on the screen.  Using their names helps emphasize the humanity of the characters, and the brewed up nature of their predicament.  As a viewer whenever you see that text on the screen your heart drops for the characters, and you feel the tension of constructing a ladder in your head   figuring out which women are left over, and predicting who will be pit against who in the future.  It makes for an intense, emotionally charged thrill ride.*Spoilers*The major flaw in the film's resolution occurs when Zoe's character Sabrina decides to make a run for it, leaving herself obviously vulnerable to gunfire. In the first act when all the women held captive are talking about escaping, Sabrina is the one who talks about the 'capabilities' of the cult   that it would be near impossible.  It is also established in her history that she was a prisoner of war, and escaped that prison on her own.  So it really doesn't make sense that her character would run away from this barn in broad daylight.As a viewer I saw it coming from a mile away that she would be gunned down, and worse yet her character misses this possibility having survived the exact same scenario previously.  It makes the ending seem anticlimactic and feels unfortunate because the film had taken such a great right turn to get Sabrina there in the first place.  Not that Sabrina should not have died, but she had a barn full of the unarmed cult members while she wielded twin pistols, and she just let them live.Sabrina does have scruples and doesn't like killing for the sport of it, but these people are directly responsible for the deaths of who knows how many girls.  Letting them live means letting them recreate this sadistic ritual all over again.  On top of that it isn't really clear that Sabrina knows her daughter is safe in the end, which is her whole objective.  Unfortunately the film's third act just doesn't go far enough.  It is still a great movie, but its strengths exasperate the weakness of this finale.","Poorly Thought Out Ending, Otherwise Great",1398729600,"04 29, 2014",4,1

"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;Big Ass Spider!&#8221;1. This enjoyable, ultra low budget Z movie is kind of like those movies made for the SyFy Channel, except better.2. It&#8217;s about, well, a big jazz spider.3. A spider eats it&#8217;s way out of a dead body at a hospital, and goes on a rampage, growing really fast, making webs, and spitting acid on people.4. A goofy exterminator named Alex and a Mexican security guard named Jose find themselves competing with the military to find and kill the spider.5. The movie clearly wasn&#8217;t trying to take itself serious. It knows exactly what it is, and revels in it. As proof that the director knows what he was making, Lloyd Kaufman has a cameo (if you don&#8217;t know who Lloyd Kaufman is, don&#8217;t worry about it. It would take too long to explain).6. The budget is so low that apparently the director actually cast the film from his Facebook friends. The special effects are pretty bad, except for the spider. I think all the money went to making the spider. It looks pretty cool.7. It&#8217;s also really funny. The main characters, Alex and Jose, have a great chemistry and comic timing.8. It&#8217;s an homage to other monster movies, and you can find references to many other films here.9. If you are expecting an actual horror monster movie, you will hate this. But if you&#8217;re in the mood for a stupid smart, good natured monster comedy, then this is something you&#8217;ll want to check out.","A funny, tongue-in-cheek creature feature",1390435200,"01 23, 2014",4,1

"General Pang Qing Yun is the sole survivor of his entire battalion. The Ching army was taken out against Taiping rebels in Hechuan. A woman named Lian spends the night with Pang and leaves before he wakes the next morning. Jiang Wuyang, one of the bandits that rides into the town Pang currently finds himself in, is impressed with Pang's fighting skills and introduces Pang to Zhao Er Hu. Jiang and Er Hu take Pang to their village where Pang is reunited with Lian who just so happens to be Er Hu's wife. The bandits from the village overthrow a pjazzing food convoy and that is thought to be a resolution to their current desperation until the imperial army invades and usurps the food that they stole. Pang, Er Hu, and Jiang take a blood oath to become blood brothers before joining Lord Chen's army. With the odds against them, their 800 soldiers get the upper hand on Shu City's 5,000 as plans are put into motion to overthrow Suzhou and Nanjing, the capital. The brothers soon begin to fall apart on their rise to the top. Er Hu tends to be loyal with his word and his brothers no matter what as Pang will sacrifice anyone and even make deals with his enemies just to win while Jiang is stuck in the middle.This movie is phenomenal. The battle sequences are stunning, the cinematography is brilliant, and the acting is top notch. The Warlords took everything that was fantastic about Mongol and made it just a little bit better. Jet Li deserves a mention. After seeing Unleashed and Fearless, it was nice to see him actually show his acting chops again. The desire to see him at that acting capacity was high, so it was quite a treat to see him at that caliber once again. After The Forbidden Kingdom and his rather stale performance in that, it's become a bit difficult what to expect from him other than him displaying how talented he is at martial arts. Fortunately, he did a great job in this as he showed just about every emotion in this film at some time or another. His fight scenes were also incredible, but that is kind of a given. Andy Lau also deserves a nod. His character is just so pjazzionate about being honorable and loyal that when things go wrong, his reaction is just explosive. He has some really powerful scenes where he's fighting for what he thinks is right. There's a scene where a play is mocking him and his brothers while he's eating dinner. He begins to laugh, which leads to him crying uncontrollably, and then he begins laughing again. He just managed to pull it off flawlessly and it was incredibly impressive.The battle scenes didn't pull any punches either. Blood flies across the screen as limbs roll on the ground. It's truly fantastic. They are the highlight of the film as the first half seems to not pull away from the battlefield. The film is also extremely colorful. Every scene is stunningly vibrant. There are so many memorable scenes from the film and half of that is due to how they were shot. There's a scene where Er Hu runs into a coliseum where there are just hundreds of dead bodies lying on the ground and the camera does a 360 degree motion around him capturing his emotions and the devastation that lies around him. It's amazing.The Warlords is one of the best Chinese war epics I've ever seen. Not that I've seen too many of them, but even in comparison to feudal Japan films, it's one of the best.  If you were a fan of films like Mongol: The Rise of Genghis Kahn, The Last Samurai, or Seven Samurai, then this comes highly recommended.

"Those with any sort of interest in cricket should be enthusiastic about the release of ""Fire in Babylon.""  This intense and eye opening documentary from Stevan Riley tracks the evolution of the West Indian cricket team from its inception to its inevitable place as International champions.  Their struggles and successes happened in a worldwide arena of racism, political maneuvering, and apartheid.  Far from being a traditional underdog story (and at heart, that's what it is), this is an illuminating look at how the sport developed and the historical context in which this small group of players challenged the status quo.  The team's success is mirrored in how this small chain of islands jazzerted a newfound national pride and identity after years of colonial rule.  By taking the English gentleman's sport and appropriating it as a field of battle, it changed cricket forever (for good and for bad).Riley has jazzembled all of the prominent names that you might expect to look back on a certain era (most of the footage deals with the mid seventies to the mid eighties).  It documents that the early team notoriety was as entertainers with no particular talent for the sport and notes that the turning point was when they were decimated by the fast bowl pitches of the Australians.  Employing many of the same techniques, the West Indians created a better and more formidable team with four of these notorious fast bowlers.  As their reputation grew (both for talent and brutality), they ascended to the heights of cricket.  The film shows how the team fought the oppression of its own council to break free of its restrictions, divided over issues of apartheid when certain players were coerced into playing in South Africa, faced casual racism around the world, and challenged their former rulers to attain a grudging respect.  You see plenty of cricket, for sure, but a healthy interest in world events will further enhance the experience of viewing ""Fire in Babylon.""Riley's film is filtered through the perspective of the West Indian team.  Some may see this as a criticism, but it is their viewpoint and interviews that make up the bulk of the film.  For example, as the sport became progressively more dangerous, rules were formalized to protect batters from intentional injury.  And many players were being seriously injured (some with career ending hits).  While some might see this as a necessary response (myself included), the West Indians perceived it as a casual attack on them personally to destroy their team.  It's easy to see their point of view as these rulings affected them greatly, but things have a broader context than are expressed in this film.  Still, ""Fire in Babylon"" raises a lot of great issues and highlights a lot of great players.  In many ways, as I mentioned, it is an underdog story with tremendous appeal.  And not just a sports film, the story shows how our heroes can also stand as significant political and sociological role models in troubled times.  Strong stuff.

"IMO this is a good idea for a show, but its just a little too ""Disney"" I dont understand why everyone in the show is hot, I havent seen one fat guy in the entire show. the Shannon family looks weird like a bunch of Disney channel actors. Also the show is just a little too PG 13. There is a lot of stuff that doesnt make sense in the show, why arent there more dinosaurs, how come even all the bad guys look like a bunch of models? and whole bad guy army look great, but act like a bunch of pansies. One thing I absolutely LOVE though, is the Taylor guy he is absolutely prefect for the role, and so is Shannon. Shannons wife and kids get on my nerves tough, too Disney world, like the whole show.

"This, to be frank, will not be a very critical post. To my shame, for I am a manly man, I am one of them, whatchamacallit, ""marshmallows,"" a devotee of the late, lamented series, Veronica Mars. This silver screen resurrection was such a darn longshot... How the movie came about says something about the emergence of social media as a determining factor in the film industry. Freakin' yay for the Kickstarter campaign and its 91,585 backers and the shattered records, including that it met its $2 million goal in the first day of the campaign and went on to triple the thing at $5.7 million. The behind the scenes story is so feel good. Veronica Mars, the movie, is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago, we used to be friendsBut I haven't thought of you lately at all...It's been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica, back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone's biz in Neptune, Cali. The movie's opening sequence fills us in on what she's been up to. Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court. (So much for what would've been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI.) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19, got herself a B.A. in psychology at Stanford, was near the top of her cljazz in Columbia law. Interview over, Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down. And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) is implicated in murder and he calls her, pleading for her help, she jazzures her current beau that she's only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise. So it's back home for Veronica, a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised. That unknown murderer lurking in the midst   because it can't possibly be Logan, right?   almost seems a footnote. Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated. It's still ultimately about the underdog, the perceived loser, putting one over the bullies. Very much intact is that marvelous father daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni. Veronica and Logan's relationship is still... complicated. Veronica still cracks wise. She's still incredibly dogged. There's huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces. Everyone came back! Plus, there's a surprise cameo or three. Okay, if you don't know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars, you won't get it. But this isn't about luring in the uninitiated. See, you've caught me in mid celebration. I'm still gobsmacked that there's a Veronica Mars movie, and I think we marshmallows suspected it wasn't gonna make tons of money, but so what? Maybe tomorrow I'll watch this again and then I'll notice flaws. But that's tomorrow. This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers, the cast, and the ardent, mobilized fans. For now, I'm keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD's bonus stuff:  ""By the Fans: The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie""   a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas, Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record breaking Kickstarter launch to pre production to the first day on set and beyond!

I have three favorite shows that I watch weekly and The Originals is one of them. And I do believe it is becoming my favorite. I feel that the people that put this show and the Vampire Diaries together (Writers, Directors, Casting etc.) really know what they are doing. I love watching Joseph Morgan work. You love his character then you get mad when he does unspeakable things the two minutes later you forgive him and your in love with him again. And not to leave out the rest of the cast.

What he hears is the ugly word getting laughs and that seems like a good thing, when it is not.

I find the action accurate,  the cast very good (especially the women) and it holds my interest fromstart to finish.  I like especially the occasional connection with CHICAGO PD and the inter relationships between the two depts.I am a little disturbed by some political correctness is the emphasis of women as firemen; something I am against for physical as wellas psychological reasons.  Still, the cast is very good and I like everyone I have seen on both shows.  And the women do their jobswell.

"A Lonely Place To Die is a very Atmospheric film that not only has beautiful scenery and cinematography but also packs a punch as far as storyline and execution.The Acting is first rate and it is what it is, there really aren't any big aha moments or unexpected twists.The group of mountain climbers are in a race for their lives and the life of the little girl they saved from a man made underground prison.Many lives will be lost be it the pursuers and  or the Climbers.The main question is why do the men with heavy artillery chasing them want the girl so bad,where did she come from and will she be returned safety and will any of the climbers be alive to make sure she is?One of the best adventure suspense thrillers of the year in my opinion because it's no nonsense and cuts right to the literal chase.There is quite a bit of violence and blood but nothing that put's it in Slasher mode although I have seen many slashers with less blood.Bottom line it's well worth a rent and even a buy.",Ropes you in and never lets up,1326672000,"01 16, 2012",5,1

"From the time I watched the first episode of the first season of POI, I have found it to be full of different twists and turns where the writers have woven some very interesting plots.  The character development of each of the prime individuals on the show is what has consistently drawn me back to it week after week.  After watching last weeks episode, where Carter was shot down, I waited with baited breath to see how The Devil's Share episode was going to be presented.  I can say I was not disappointed in the delivery of the episode.  Instead of disappointment, I can truthfully state that I was amazed and drawn in to the feelings that each character displayed.  I also truly LOVED the backward glances that have continued to be produced and for this episode I can also voice (soo sad that you readers can not hear it)  WOOOWWW........... I will not give away the backward glances that I saw; but can state that you need to watch this episode carefully so that you see how the pysches of several of the characters are developed.

Well all of that *is* true, and when I go to my parents' places (I have 2 sets), I somehow cannot escape watching the same dang Nostradamus and May Magdalene episodes over and over like groundhog day.  Apparently these are the most popular for Christmas Yule  most popular Christian episode and Pagan episode respectively.Ancient Aliens, the Series, has surprised me.  I have not been able to stop watching it.  Having read 'Chariots of the Gods' when I was maybe 10 yrs old, an unusual book I found from a used book store at the time, this subject has long held my interest.  One thing I remember from that book is the idea that the ark of the covenant was a communication device, which an interpretation that some part of it would act as an antenna. Ancient Aliens explores that idea and other similar ideas.  It is nice to see the author of that book in person, as a regular guest in this series.I could not imagine that there could be so many seasons of this series; because I thought the examples would be quite thin.  Turns out, that's quite wrong.  There seems to be overwhelming evidence that the ancient people of earth not only have a much longer history than we believed, but it was much more interesting than we believed as well.  I'm not convinced that we had help from aliens yet, but there is a lot of really unsettling but at the same time fascinating information in this series.",Astonishingly good series,1395878400,"03 27, 2014",5,1

"It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @$$ little kid. It says something about today's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth. There's probably a good joke in that line....But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer. What's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him, even after he's gone? Not even the Writer's Strike can get in the way of this train. It's bad. Very bad. And that's good.Why is it that we gravitate towards those who, twenty years ago, who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art' in the media sense of the word. And I guess it says something else about our world today when we've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy. Progressive or the way of the High Road?Whatever. That's all philosophy.

"I didn't know what to expect with this remake, but I was totally impressed with the feel of it.  The casting was perfect!  The story was ""cljazzic trek"" which should make any fan of the original television series more than pleased.  There were a few odd additions  (like the quirky relationship between Uhura and Spock, the fate of Spock's mother, and the ultimate demise of the Romulan villain) that didn't gel with what I remembered from the original, but hopefully if this remake kick starts a new resurgence of sequels, these odd additions may evolve and or be explained in later movies.Overall, this is an awesome remake amidst a dismal gallery of very bad ones in a variety of genres.

Oh, I was satisfied with the outcome (ending) and won't say another word about it.The cast of characters (although their names all unfamiliar to me) were perfectly suited for their roles and each did  fantastic.  They were all quite believable and so the story flowed effortlessly throughout   what a top notch job!So, looking for a great horror film for the weekend?

"I enjoy selected episodes in this series because I'm a writer. I'm always interested in quirky topics that might become part of a story    either a nonfiction book about odd phenomena or a novel (fiction) that could benefit from an intriguing detail or real life, baffling thread.So, this series has been very helpful. I like that each episode is about one main topic. After an introduction to things familiar to most fans of X Files, etc., the show often focuses on the most unexplored (or least known) aspect of the topic du jour.The narration is very good. Often, the videos are superb. They make it easy for me to take notes that capture the essence of the topic and, if I'm including the location in a novel, I get a strong sense of what it would be like to visit wherever it is.This series has a running focus related to aliens. However, instead of limiting itself to the same old UFO topics, these shows bring attention to odd, unusual, quirky, and intriguing peripheral topics.  While die hard UFO fans may not be as dazzled as I am, if you're a researcher who likes paranormal, New Age, and offbeat (&#34;cue the Twilight Zone soundtrack&#34;) subjects...

"I just finished this series and now am going into season 9.  I titled this season SOME LAUGHS; SOME TEARS because there is some added Castle type humor, some really weird episodes and then some really teary episodes.  I don't want to spill the proverbialbeans so I won't be specific but there is some changes here in the cast; one in particular who I have become very fond of.  Also asignificant death of one of the CSI persons. I was not particularly fond of this person, but he she did not deserve what happened tothem.  Grissom finally falls for someone but after a serious murder attempt on her life, the relationship falters a bit.  There is a veryvile murderer who makes miniature models of the crime scenes even before the killings happen.  And the models are incrediblyaccurate.  I still haven't made up my mind if I like Cate Willows; sometimes she seems like she really hates men. sometimes not.But she appears arrogant in much of what she does.  And doesn't anyone in L.V. stay married?  While I love the show, I don't thinkI want to visit there; Detroit has safer streets!!  There seems to be whores all over the place; not my favorite type of women.And there is the crossdressing Carp.  The quality of the productions continue to be outstanding;  a superb cast and terrific musicalaccompanying backdrops.  Good background and theme music is extremely important to me in TV and motion pictures.  Some ofthe murders are so gruesomely realistic I almost have to turn away....almost anyhow!  I have 13 seasons to date, but won't getthe 14th until the price comes down a bit.  Still,I get them all from Amazon.  And of all the shows I watch, only two bad castingsthat I judge:  Jar Jar Binn & Dr. Sweets, although I suppose we could include Martha from CASTLE.

"Teenage angst is a fairly common theme in books and movies these days, and I must say this one was done quite well.  At first blush it feels as if the movie is slow paced and simply plodding along, until you allow your mind to wander and you realize all of the subtle nuances your subconscious has been picking up.  This movie is more than a simple girly teen flick, there is psychological impact inside of this story.  Lily Cole was excellent in her role as the new girl; she portrayed a definite creepiness, using minute facial movements and deadpan stares that were still filled with menace.  Sarah Bolger did a wonderful job in her role, and left me wondering if she would find the strength to deal or if she would crack up; I would have liked to see more of Valerie Tian and Melissa Farman, too.

"When we last heard from writer director Sarah Polley, she had earned a 2008 Academy Award nomination for her adapted screenplay for her debut feature film ""Away From Her"". Now finally comes Polley's second feature film.""Take This Waltz"" (116 min.) brings the story of Margot (played by Michelle Williams), whopo is in her late 20s, married for 5 years to Lou (played by Seth Rogen), and living in Toronto. Then one day a handsome guy named Daniel (played by Luke Kirby) moves in across the street, and almost immediately Margot and Daniel start flirting with each other. The entire movie is built towards the ""will they or won't they"" question. All the other side stories, including some juicy scenes involving Lou's sister (played by Sarah Silverman), are secondary at best, as they do not move the film forward. The movie felt a bit too sugarcoated for my liking, as if I was watching some Nicholas Sparks adopted movie.But there are several pluses that make this sill worthwhile checking out, none more so that the stellar acting performance, again, by Michelle Williams. If you just take her last 3 major roles (Blue Valentine; My Week With Marilyn; Take This Waltz), it's becoming clear to me that she is the Meryl Streep of this acting generation. Just outstanding, and she makes the most of what I think is rather uneven material. Another major plus is the (heavily Canadian artist oriented) soundtrack, which brings a bunch of great tunes, some well known (Leonard Cohen's title track of the movie; the Buggles' Video Killed the Radio Star), and others not so much (Ron Sexsmith, a Canadian treasure; Micah Hinson, Corrian Rose, etc.).

"This excellent British espionage tv show came onto my radar late last year, and I remember consuming all of the episodes within one weekend. While the core plot is rather run of the mill as far as spy stories go  agent gets betrayed, then tries to figure out by who, then vanquish them   this tv show really elevates itself with its stunning cinematography and a tremendous performance by lead Melissa George. She reminds me a lot like Continuum's Rachel Nichols, yet I think George can handle the physicality of this type of role even better than Nichols. She's volatile, intelligent, emotionally complex and her performance grounds the rest of the show.At times I felt like the numerous subplots were taking up a bit too much attention, but towards the final episode you could see how what you thought were subplots were really part of the spider web of the overarching plot. It is a slow burn though   episodes don't contain concluded stories within each one of them like CSI. It's more akin to The Killing or Broadchurch  things happen in their own time when they need to happen as opposed to being stuck within having to finish within one episode. That's not to say that there isn't any action or it's just a bunch of talking  there's tension and suspense galore, just don't go into it expecting Alias. Also, like most spy related entertainment   there are some logic gaps that you just end up having to swallow and move on to keep being immersed in the experience.The directing also deserves a major kudos, as this tv show is just a visual feast with an eye for detail that not many tv shows even attempt much less succeed with. It's not about flashy theatrics but showcasing the natural landscape and type of camera angles to create something really special.Right now this series is sort of floundering as original producer BBC One has said no to a second season, but it looks like Cinemax may help it get there. Even if it's not picked up for a second season, it still resolved enough of the story that watching this season was still tremendously satisfying though there are major stories left unexplored. All in all, a very thrilling tv show where I could not physically stop myself from watching the next episodes. For fans of female fronted action a la Continuum or Haywire with touches of Homeland and The Americans, and anyone who simply enjoys a great spy story.",Slow Burning Spy Drama with Fantastic Characterization,1376092800,"08 10, 2013",5,1

"How awesome is it that Jack is back? (Answer: really awesome!) Those who prefer it can call 24: Live Another Day as the consolation prize for the proposed movie that was more rumor than real. Those even more cynical can put 24's resurrection down to that Fox's ratings have pretty much sucked a   this season, and so, hey, why not pull a mercenary move and revive a popular, still much lamented show as we head into summer and the upfronts? Whatevs, yo. What matters is that Jack's back and as lean and mean as ever and this time (or thus far) reliant solely on the underworld for his tech and field support.For some, a bit of SPOILERS now (not many).But what could make him emerge from off the grid? That he resurfaces in London makes for a refreshing shift in venue.

The opening moments: When intel tracks Jack in London's grubby East End, operatives from the CIA London station are deployed.I love how brisk the pace is. It hearkens back to the first two seasons when the storylines moved and were tightly interconnected. With only 12 episodes to work with, there won't be any room for bloated sub plots. The writers don't have to filibuster. Anyway, this time, clearly Jack already has his necessary intel to spring into action.I had a quick laugh when Jack's voiceover remarked that the following takes place between 11:06am and 12pm. I had hoped for things to be moving fast, but darn can Jack resolve everything in only 54 minutes? But of course not.And not to get all nostalgic, but I clapped like mad when the iconic split screen came in only 14 seconds into the first episode. 24 has always rolled with them hot button current events. Here, issues such as drone surveillance warfare and Edward Snowden type leaks are integral to the narrative. The latter bit has enveloped Chloe O'Brien (Mary Lynn Rajskub, always in fine form). I'm rarin' to find out what the past four years have dropped on her, because she's changed, boyo. She's now a subversive tech head releasing secret government files into the wild (a.k.a. the Internet). She's gotten the Stieg Larsson treatment: the tats, the too much eye goop, the emo messy hair. But the sense of alienation had already been there.I'm expecting big things out of Yvonne Strahovski who bodes to be another badjazz female agent, but maybe not as badjazz as Sarah Walker. Strahovski's Kate Morgan seems to be the only CIA agent who has a head on her shoulders. So, of course, as Season 9 opens, she's held in disgrace and being demoted and about to be transferred stateside.The rest of the supporting cast seem promising. It's intriguing, what's going on with the beleaguered President Heller (William Devane), here in London to push his drone initiative. And if you'd seen Seasons 4 6, then you know that her daughter Audrey (Kim Raver) is someone who matters to Jack. And having Michelle Fairley as the prospective big bad and Stephen Fry as the British Prime Minister must fall into the category of brilliant casting coups.Kiefer Sutherland has made a boatload of movies and television shows. But, first and foremost, he's Jack Bauer. Like, when I first saw Kiefer in that TV show, Touch, I said, ""Hey, Jack Bauer's in Touch."" I love how Kiefer is so committed to 24. I read that the tats on Jack are real tattoos Kiefer had gotten specifically for the role.I forgot how addictive 24 is. When the show's minding its P's and Q's, it's as riveting and pulse pounding and twisty as anything. It's gratifying that 24: Live Another Day has found its groove already. 24 has always had the soul of the western. And Jack Bauer, old time sheriff with the tarnished tin star, is genetically spliced to clean up them rotten towns.

There's many twists and turns as the season goes on. This last season certainly doesn't disappoint and it's probably the best next to season 1. The season was packed with action and drama.

Since Netflix sometimes doesn't have the following season I did an online search and to my dismay found that SGU had been cancelled.SGU was something different and apart from the other science fiction series and I really liked how each chapter incorporated parts from the previous chapters.Perhaps its plot was too complex for the average viewer or there wasn't enough sex or strong language or perhaps not enough people shooting guns and blowing things up.Whatever the reason, it was a poor choice because season 2, in my mind, was just opening up to all that SGU was about and I will always wonder how the final cliff hanger would have played out.",SGU: A Tragic Loss When It Was Cancelled,1397001600,"04 9, 2014",5,1
I've watched this series twice now and enjoyd it greatly each time.  It takes you back to the early 1900's when such things as indoor plumbing and electricity were new.

"This one I'm going to keep short and sweet.Almost everything I raved about in my review of season one applies equally to season two. The art continues to be extremely stylish, and to preserve that ever so slightly ""gritty"" comic book feel that we rarely get to see in animation. On the level of the individual episodes, the storytelling is action packed, lightning paced, and riveting. The season spanning story arcs are cleverly put together and emotionally engaging. Indeed, I should really say ""series spanning"", because the continuity here is seamless: much of what we see in season two flows on directly from season one.The bottom line is that this is a great show that both children and adults can enjoy. It's smart, but accessible. It may not deconstruct its own genre in the way thatWatchmenorJustice League Unlimiteddid. But it does give us both characters and a universe of genuine depth and complexity. One of the many things I love about this show is that very occasionally, it does dip its toe in the waters of the broader Marvel Universe. Just as in season one we had a couple of members of the Fantastic Four show up for poker night, this time around we get a team up with everyone's favorite hometown hero, Spider Man. Not just the kind of team up that simply means that there's an extra guy in spandex to punch the baddies, either. All the cljazzic Spider Man braggadocio and angst come along for the ride.So yes, as superhero cartoons go, this is one of the great ones.About the only down side worth mentioning is that they've spoiled the rather stylish season one opening titles by overlaying an extremely cheesy voice over, consisting of a kind of micro bio of the team as a whole, and of a few of the main characters (e.g. ""The Hulk! Strongest hero there is!"").That, and the fact that this, the second season, is also apparently the last.Why, Marvel?Why???Theo.",More of The Same - And That's A Good Thing!,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",5,1

"Note: I saw every episode of this show via XFinity On Demand, in HD.CBS' latest new sicence fiction action drama is PERSON OF INTEREST, with a twist. Instead of getting numbers from a Machine, the lead solves crimes with the extraordinary help of a chip implanted in his brain. Plus, there's a beautiful Secret Service Agent (Meghan Orry, who guest starred was a season regular on ONCE UPON A TIME) jazzigned to protect him. Their superior? A tough, but very understanding woman (Marg Helgenberger, who cracked cold cases alongside Gil Grissom, Raymond Langston and D.B. Russell on CSI: Crime Scene Investigation). The concept of the show is brilliantly executed, and the dialogue is smartly written, with Gabriel and Riley's interactions always providing humour into what would otherwise be a serious procedural, ala HANNIBAL.I hope the show gets renewed for a second season.EDIT   10 May 2014INTELLIGENCE has been cancelled. I guess the concept was too intelligent for the doltish idiots at CBS. At least, it didn't end on a cliffhanger, like so many other shows (yes, I'm talking to YOU, Fox & ABC, for cancelling Almost Human, Charlie's Angels, Missing, Killer Women, Betrayal & Lois And Clark: The New Adventures Of Superman.

"The SyFy network is definitely getting better at producing SciFi shows. Defiance is turning out to be more like a soap opera. Not that I consider this a negative, but more of a plus for the show. Each episode is more into storytelling and character development. Too many of the SciFi shows are single episode centered and use special effects as a basis for entertainment. While Defiance is low on special effects, the storyline and characters are interesting enough to keep me watching.At this point, the budget for Defiance seems to be on the lower side. Sometimes this makes the producers strive for a better product, sometimes not. My biggest issue with the show are some of the alien costumes and makeup are just a bit too fake looking. If you watch in HD this is far more noticeable, so I watch on my projector, which helps lessen the degree of fakeness. Don't let the lower budget thing scare you away. I would much rather watch a good story with a lower budget than a poor story with a bunch of costly special effects thrown in as compensation.Grant Bowler, Julie Benz, Tony Curran and company are doing a great job. I think it is a show with a lot of potential. Unfortunately, in today's TV world, unless the show starts off with great numbers, they tend to get axed fairly quickly. I hope the SyFy channels gives this series a fair chance.","So far, so good......",1374364800,"07 21, 2013",4,1

"This is my first exposure to Endeavour Morse (I never watched the old TV series) and I have to admit, I was shocked by just how good it is.  I'm a fan of Sherlock and Hannibal (as well as the US TV series The Bridge) and this show more than satisfies my craving for mystery.I did not expect to like Morse as much as a I do.  I was afraid of another Benedict Cumberbatch type, but Morse is more boyish.  Don't get me wrong  he isn't common, or an everyman.  He is highly intelligent but, similar to actual intelligent people, he does not always step correctly.  It is clear that he has a lot to learn (as Strange said in Season 1, no one can teach you how to be a detective, but any fool can learn police work) and I'm interested in watching this character grow.I'm glad that Season 2 has introduced a few episode spanning plotlines.  The addition of Morse's beautiful nurse neighbor, and the arrival of a yet unmasked evidence thief, are very much welcome.All in all, this is a fantastic, high quality series, and I hope it continues for at least one more season.",Excellent.,1404777600,"07 8, 2014",5,1
"I had no idea what to expect with this movie, the latest from director Errol Morris. Well regarded as one of the best documentary film makers ever, Morris began with films like GATES OF HEAVEN, VERNON FLORIDA and THE THIN BLUE LINE. Of the movies he's done in the past I was fortunate enough to see, Morris has always seemed to offer an unbiased presentation of the subject matter he chooses. With THE UNKNOWN KNOWN I think he continues that practice, even though in the extras he seems to have had an opinion of the subject on hand here.That subject is ex Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. The movie consists mainly of interviews with Rumsfeld as he discusses his life and times in the world of politics. While it could have focused solely on his time serving under George W. Bush, the film goes far back to his early years in D.C. instead. We see Rumsfeld working for various other politicians, all of which would groom him for the role of Secretary of Defense in his later years.The title of the film comes from a comment made during a press briefing while the war in Iraq was going on. Rumsfeld said at that time &#34;There are known knowns; there are things we know that we know. There are known unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don't know. But there are also unknown unknowns   there are things we do not know we don't know.&#34; While it might be confusing to some if you actually read what he said it makes sense. It was a time when we had conflicting information at best, out and out lies at worst and a world where terrorist considered flying planes into targets on American soil as something worth doing.What is fascinating to watch here is the way Rumsfeld speaks, how he firmly holds on to the beliefs he had at the time and how he can defend any and all actions that were taken then. He is an eloquent speaker and it's amazing that he wasn't allowed to do so more throughout his career. One can imagine that if he were to appear at a lecture nearby you would want to be there to hear what he had to say based on this film.Even more interesting than the film itself is the reaction that people have to the film. When you read reviews you find that those who lean left feel that he traps himself in his beliefs and statements and should be condemned for what he says. Those that lean right will see Rumsfeld here saying the things that need to be said, taking a stand and showing that the decisions that were made were the correct ones. My guess is that depending on which direction you follow you will leave with your mind unchained after watching this film. That's actually sad because love him or hate him, there is much to learn from this man.My suggestion to all who choose to watch this film is to go and read numerous reviews before doing so. Don't worry about spoilers because this man's life has been on display from the first moment he walked onto the streets of Washington. Read the reviews and try to glean from them the bent of the person writing. Try to find views from both sides. Then watch this movie and see if you agree or disagree. This isn't how I did it, I went in with no real idea what to expect.For myself I honestly tend to lean right with a more libertarian bent. I found that many of the things Rumsfeld presented here seemed intelligent and well thought out. I found his charm to be genuine while reviews have stated that he is a master of covering his innermost demons, never allowing them to be seen. Rarely do those on the left consider the fact that he might actually be a nice guy and not the monster they want to portray him as.As I said, my guess is most won't walk away with their conception of Rumsfeld changed after viewing this film. Any who push the start button after putting this disc in and attempt to watch it with an open mind might though. Love him or hate him, Rumsfeld is a historical figure that will long be remembered. Myself I'm glad we had someone willing to make the hard decisions at the time he was in Washington. Disagree if you like, but at least attempt to watch with an objective mind when viewing this film.",DETERMINED BY YOUR POINT OF VIEW,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",4,1

"I've seen a lot of people throw around the phrase ""a lot like Buffy andAngel"" or ""the best show sinceBuffyand Angel"" or things of that nature.  Thing is, most of those shows aren't.  None of them are like Angel, and the only one I've seen so far to match Buffy isVeronica Mars.  Well, get ready Angel fans, because the show has finally got something that's come close to a worth successor.  Now in its third season, Eric Kripke'sSupernaturalcontinues to show that it has mastered the balance of horror, humor, mythology, and drama that Angel was known for.  But enough with the comparisons.  ""Supernatural"" is a great show on its own, and this season is proof of that.The writer's strike left a lot of shows with less than stellar material, but not this show.  Each episode, even the less impressive ones, entertain to the fullest.  While the overall arc and even the episode by episode quality isn't as great as the fantastic second season, it remains a quality show packed with emotional highs, lows, and ""Holy     , I can't believe they just did that!"" moments.  This season sets out to tie the previous seasons up nicely, giving deserving ends to many of the old arcs.  The Gordon storylin gets paid off, as does the ""Sam Dean are wanted men"" arc.  The main story of the season, however, springs from the deal that Dean made in the finale ofthe second season.Dean, to bring Sam back from the death, made a deal that his soul will be taken to Hell in one year's time.  The bulk of the season, though it maintains a somewhat episodic feel, deals with that situation, throwing the two brothers into a fight against the one force they can't conquer again: Death.  Dean's impending death adds such a poignancy to the season, particularly the episodes stretching from the Christmas special to the finale, that even his possible resurrection in Season Four (it has to happen, people) wouldn't take away from the emotional resonance of this arc.Overall, it's a slight step down from the fantastic Season Two, but still a great season of a great show.

"OK, the first thing you need to know about Lillyhammer is that it was produced for Norwegian NetworkTV.....not an American audience (although it translates well). Ignore the silly comments about &#34;nosubtitles&#34;....they are right here on the stream just like they are right there on Netflix if you have thatservice, as they are on the DVD.The story is very simple, Frankie the Fixer rolls over on his mob boss, is offered his choice of placesto relocate and fixes on Lillehammer (because he saw it on the Olympics and thought it was cool). Oncehe arrives, he soon finds out things are done differently in Norway, and the show is basically about howFrankie (now Giovanni Johnny) figures out his own solutions to the daily obstacles of life in Norway thatare constantly being tossed in his way. For example, he finds from the local constable that his driverslicense is invalid and left to walk back to town only to be told by the local DMV that it takes 6 months toget a license in Norway.

"Though I was able to predict what the event Jack is trying to prevent from happening. The show is what I expected.Anyone have watched the series of 24 all the way up to now.  Should know to expect the time would only be 1 hour long or actually only about 45 mins long as in each hour episode there is a period of time where the clock time counts down when your not seeing anything happen.  Its all part of the suspense you get with 24.So though the first episode showed more than 46 mins of time I was only expecting about 45 minutes or so of episode 1.  The description of episode one stated that there was a Bonus of a premiere show. So I knew what to expect when I started watching the first episode of 24.I am happy to see another season of Jack Bauer and can only expect to see more of the same type of action that I am used to seeing in the various seasons of 24.Fox has in the past given a preview of other episodes included for free in the episode that you purchase. I am fine with that, as I didn't pay any more than I would have anyways.For me I am not at all interested in the season Premiere of &#34;Gang Related&#34;.  I watched about 2 mins and decided the show was not for me. I Stopped episode 1 and moved right on to episode 2 for another enjoyable 46min experience of 24.There are a few surprises in the the two episodes I have seen so far which is good. I was able to predict the theft of the device before it occurred but did not expect who it was that betrayed the bad guy in episode 2.

"There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one, including THE X FILES, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, and FARSCAPE.  There are a variety of reasons for this in each case.  With STARGATE, it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates.  Season One was basically your stargate of the week format, each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode.  This is the format usually preferred by network executives, since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background.  Serious fans, on the other hand, vastly prefer the complex storylines, where each week's episode does not stand on its own, but is embedded in an ongoing saga, almost like a chapter in a huge novel.  This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy, though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did, but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races (only a few that we have met by the end of the season) aligned against the Goa'uld.  The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer.  But it was not only the season long arc; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better.  All in all, the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected, but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale.  Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one.  The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised.  Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed.  STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times.  My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode.  If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows, then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget.  I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale, though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap.  Nonetheless, it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One, the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG 1 team, with all other character functioning as supporting characters.  We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons, the most important being General Jacob Carter, Samantha's father.  His importance to the show is cemented in the two part episode that introduces the Tok'ra, a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld, only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts.  Since Sam's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak's host is dying, he is approached to become a host, since Selmak can cure the cancer.  This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season, when Sam's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut.  Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program, he can't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all, this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci fi series that television has seen.  Although I've never forgiven the Sci fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE, keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes.",Good first season is followed by a great second season,1149379200,"06 4, 2006",5,1

"Europa Report, released by the limited theater style company Magnet Releasing, the film is set in the near future (around 2061), where a group of astronauts are sent to Europa, one of Jupiter's moons in search of extra terrestrial life. After the accidental death of a crew member, the crew makes it to Europa, but what they find will change everything.I see some people trying to compare this to other movies, but in all actuality, you can't. There is no way this is similar to any sci fi movie ever because, well, it is a truly realistic depiction of deep space exploration and extra terrestrial life. Another thing that makes this movie unique, is it goes off of real science. There is nothing unrealistic about Europa Report, whatsoever, and that is why it doesn't appeal to everyone. It is slow burning, feeling like a real documentary on a mission to Europa, the actors and actresses are all incredible, and there is not a single sub plot; no romances, no tensions between crew members, just the mission. I do not care for the ""found footage"" subgenre much, feeling like it has gone through the wringer more times that it needed to (the terrible Paranormal Activity films being the main source), but this movie, this experience, was terrifying. If we found alien life in our solar system, this is what it would most likely look like. Science, medical practices and philosophy would all be impacted by this discovery, in some ways good and some ways bad.In the end, Europa Report is for hard core science fiction fans, and those who like slow moving, very focused films because, even though it may be slow, the intensity in the last third of the film is almost unbearable. In my opinion, we really should launch a team to Europa and drill beneath the ice at some point in the foreseeable future because, what if there is something beneath the ice? The very thought gives me chills, and the idea that some thing doesn't just live there, but lurks there is also a bit disturbing.5 5 Stars*****",Not Just a Movie,1374796800,"07 26, 2013",5,1

"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:I just can't fathom a more harsh penalty promulgated by my delay then to have follow a ""K Harris"" review!I can't add anything to the excellent outline provided by K Harris, though perhaps I can compliment with some additional color.  The performances are excellent and as huge fan of UK programming, the 3 main characters all have fine pedigrees:Steven Mackintosh (John the cash house manager) most recently off a stint in the *5 ""Luther""Ashley Walters (Chris the security guard) was seen in ""Hustle"" and ""Outcasts"" among a number of other seriesWarren Brown (Marcus at what can be best described as a clerk that moves the trolleys of cash into the vault) was in the excellent Zombie themed mini series ""Dead Set""I thought that the plotting was good, though I am not the biggest fan of sequences that move back and forth through timelines.  What really interested me was the motives of the 3 individuals and particularly those of John whose star was on the rise and had a newly adopted daughter (their only child).  While it is not a perfect parallel, John reminds me of a similar character played by Philip Seymour Hoffman in what was in my opinion a top 3 movie of the year in 2003 entitled ""Owning Mahowny"".  When PSH's character is asked about the rush he felt when gambling as compared to regular life.  On a scale of 10 he replied ""10 and 2"".I watched the series over 2 nights and would recommend as both a very good program and an excellent well acted change of pace from the norm.",Well acted and intense.

"This is an unusual movie in a couple of different ways. Definitely not your modern day extravaganza of CGI, this is more a movie of how monstrous humans are in difficult situations than how 'monstrous' the 'monsters' are.Given the budget of the film, all filmed on location with a video camera, it is oddly engaging. It felt, in a way, more realistic than one would expect. It is a 'people story' more than a 'monster' story. Two people, trying to make it across the 'infected zone' felt very much like two people trying to make it across Iraq or Afghanistan. The loss of those who have lost their families to a war machine   this one designed to kill giant Aliens and not Afghans, but the concept feels strangely the same. The pain is the same, no matter if the bombs fall on your loved ones due to aliens or not.One thing I didn't really care for, to tell the truth, was the two people the story is centered on. A horny, self centered jerk of a guy panting after a pretty, rich, spoiled blonde, and a pretty, rich, spoiled blonde. . . the guy is a slimy git, the girl, for all her spoiled nature, was actually bearable in a blonde sort of way.I agree with one reviewer who said, "" . . . Monsters, is a wartime travelogue featuring a social oaf who struggles to find (enough) redemption . . ."" Very apropos. Especially with the very 'wartime' feeling of the whole movie. Especially given the guy who tries to bleed the couple dry in order to find a way out of the Zone.I did love the beauty of the country, and felt that the Hispanic peoples were mostly kind, and happy to help. Overall, the realistic feel of the movie moved it for me from a 3 to a 4, just for the atmosphere.",Not a high budget blow-em-up,1348272000,"09 22, 2012",4,1

Best costar was Oded Fehr, awesome talent, some of the best story lines surrounded his and Annie's characters.

"This fourth season is the season of all come backs. The attempt to bring Zack back, but that is too artificial in a way, does not work beyond one single episode. Of course he is particularly brilliant but with this brilliancy that is so bright it dazzles us. We need someone more evanescent in this laboratory, someone who is never the same and always a come back again on some rotating basis. So the extra lab worker is the ever going project to bring back someone that cannot be brought back, hence the character that can experiment all kinds of profiles: English, Japanese, simple intern or certified doctor of something, Moslem or happily paired with a woman and not interested in the constant sexual innuendo in this lab, etc.The second come back is that of Temperance's father as some kind of museum science guide for visiting children. That one is hard on Temperance who considers her father as a criminal and has not yet forgiven him for abandoning her when a teenager in the custody of her unworthy brother who left and sent her to a foster home in a way. But that ex science teacher has the knack it takes to have contact with young teenagers and make them like what is in many ways forbidding and austere, or at least can be if you do not know how to make it an adventure. He is a genial awakener for Agent Booth's son Parker and Temperance has to yield to that demand.The third come back is the British psychologist but in a less flashy role now his barbecue is built. His main role is to set Dr Sweets, the FBI profiler, in perspective, a Dr Sweets who is so shy and so flippantly uncatchable. But he is so efficient and efficacious with the criminals who have to be discovered and caught.The next come back is that of the Gravedigger, and this time for the finish of that case. The grave digger manages to kidnap Agent Booth himself and to bury him in a navy ship just before it is blown down into the sea by the navy itself. The point that appears little by little is that the gravedigger has inside information and must be from inside the justice department or the FBI or some other Home Security agency. And that's how they find out that serial killer. At the other end Agent Booth experiences a comeback of a completely different nature. On the ship, while he is trying to escape he is helped by some ghost from deep in his mind, the corporal who was killed practically in his own arms and who he took back to base. Strange come back but quite natural for all of us: we find help in someone in our minds who makes us keep our cool and find the way out.Then we move to the come back of Agent Booth's younger brother who is a pain in the back because he is not able to do anything right without the help of his brother and he fails in some situations systematically just to get that help. A come back and a good bye too since he goes to India for a motorbike tour, but alone without his big brother. Good riddance in a way and good morning Vietnam in another. But the little boy has to grow one day.The best of this series remains the vast array of cases that bring up a vast selection of social and cultural situations that are all explored in some fine details revealing the horror of this society of ours. Of course there are a lot of winks to other series in the genre. The main wink is to Stephen King who once wrote: ""If you can't terrify your audience, then horrify them. And if you can't horrify them, then gross them out."" And you can be sure the cadavers, corpses, bodies, bones and other dead remnants of human beings are gross to the utmost. We can of course see here and there an allusion to Dexter, or another one to Crime Scene Investigation. But the style is original and personal.This season finally is very rich to reveal the deeper selves of the characters, with some strange a priori idea that Dr Temperance Brennan, Dr Lance Sweets or Agent Seeley Booth, just like Dr Zack Addy have had a youth of suffering and want on the loving side of life. And that would be why they are great in their present positions. That's too easy. And the characters that are kept in second position like Dr Camille Saroyan, Dr Jack Hodgins or Angela Montenegro cannot qualify at that level.  In other words it is a clich&eacute; that one can only be great if they have suffered in their infancy and youth. But it definitely gives the characters some density on the screen.The last episode is a complete reversal due to some brain tumor and I must say Temperance as the manageress of a club that has more to do with a brothel and an opium den than with a caf&eacute; is quite a change of perspective.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID",Why do they have only five stars?,1296172800,"01 28, 2011",5,1
"Even after more than a decade Futurama is still one of the funniest and most clever shows on TV.  This set collects the latest seasons.  Once again the writers and cast did not know if this would be their last one but since it came out Futurama has been renewed for at least one more season.The standout episode is definitely Reincarnation where the Futurama cast is remimagined as an old black and white cartoon, an 8 bit video game and a poorly dubbed anime.  Other stand outs include Cold Warriors where Fry reintroduces the common cold to the 31st century and Mobius Dick where we learn the fate of the first Planet Express crew.None of the episodes really top some of the cljazzics from the first few seasons, and one or two fall flat, but overall this is a fun show and worth watching.All of the episodes include commentaries that filled me in on any geek or science in jokes I missed.  It's great to hear the cast and crew on these, they're clearly having the time of their lives working on this show.","A few duds, but so many laughs",1330387200,"02 28, 2012",4,1

"Up to season 5 House was known as focusing a lot on the comical witticisms of House as he insulted his colleagues and his boss. This particular season takes a more serious turn, and although there does exist the comedy that it's famous for, there is a more serious aura around the entire season and its characters as all is not well in the land of Dr. Gregory House. For a medical drama, House is pretty special as it retains a very formulaic style of storytelling and wholly stays away from soap opera dramatics; instead replacing them with casual love stories, complex medical cases and an even more complex main star.Just when we think we know House, the show takes another mjazzive turn and shows us a completely different side to him that we never thought existed. Season 5 seeks on exposing a new emotional side to House. At the end of season 4 we saw the end to Wilsons girlfriend, Amber and what we are lead to believe to be the friendship of House and Wilson. Season 5 opens with our worst fears, Wilson quits and tells House that they can no longer be friends and in order for Wilson to be truly happy, he must have House out of his life.In comes a private investigator hired by House to spy on Wilson in his new life and also his team. The split doesn't last for long and House & Wilson end up back to their old tricks of childish friendship antics. Chase & Cameron gain a more prominent role in this season as their relationship is explored in more detail as Cameron struggles with the possibility of a permanent relationship as she still can't let go of the memories of her husband who died a few years prior to their relationship. This presents a higher purpose for them still remaining in the opening title sequence and hopefully, this increased prominence will mean they become a stronger part of the team in season 6.Thirteen is also forced to struggle with the fact that she has Huntington's disease, and to a certain point takes it very badly. Foreman also gains a bit more purpose in this season and develops a relationship with Thirteen, but I felt like this relationship was only brought into the picture to avoid having to fire him as even now his presence just seems pointless. Taub and Kutner are their usual selves with nothing really important happening to them other than House torturing Taub over his affair. There are quite a few delightful surprises that take place during the season, some are more important than others, but they're all designed to keep us watching to the next episode.As with every TV show, the finale is always the most special episode that will keep you wanting more up to when the next season starts. House is no exception to that rule and although most TV shows may create a cliff hanger to keep you wanting more, they would also wrap a few stories up so they don't have to be revisited. House very rarely does that. Instead it gives us riveting cliff hangers that makes us question the true brilliance of what we have seen, yet if you're not a fan of the primary cliff hanger, there's also a few other stories that you will want to know what happened next. This is a truly brilliant season that exposes a more emotional and loveable side to House that have only briefly been explored in previous seasons. There is one mjazzive shocker that most reading this review will have probably heard about by now, but it's just an overall great season and worthy of any House fans DVD collection.","As Always, Amazing",1243900800,"06 2, 2009",5,1

(We don't subscribe to cable TV, so we select two TV series to watch each year, in addition to watching some films or specials.  This series is one of the two.)

In the true story behind the film, &#34;Catch Me If You Can,&#34; the FBI agent and his criminal informant worked well together, remaining good friends even after retirement.

But the basic message of redemption through caring for more than yourself works well, and the commitment from all the actors and filmmakers is very apparent.For all its flaws and occasional odd plot twists, 33 Postcards shines with good intentions and if you like to feel your heart open a little while watching films, you might like this one.",Not lacking in cheese but full of heart,1379462400,"09 18, 2013",4,1

"In this modern day world of computers, Facebook, Tweeters ,Etc. , Imagination is slowly becoming pjazze.  Fantasy films are still being made with the CGI effect as a safety net but many of them have expunged the 'Once Upon A Time' otherworldly feeling one should experience becoming one with the tale. Writer director Neil Jordan has resurrected the 'Once Upon A Time' once again by unleashing a modern day fairytale on a jaded film going audience.  He did it once before with his excellent film 'THE COMPANY OF WOLVES' and now does it with 'ONDINE' the most beautiful, mesmerizing piece of cinema released this past year. The Irish countryside is far more breathtaking than a computerized backdrop.  By combining myths with modern day alienation from human roots, Jordan spins a tale of a fisherman who is barely getting by in his small Irish town.  Separated from his wife and father to a dying little girl, his paralysed existence is shattered when one day he catches a beautiful woman in his fishing net.  While trying to separate the myth (his little girl thinks the woman is a Selkie  a seal creature of Scottish legend) from reality, he hopelessly falls in love and cannot cope with the good fortune that comes his way.  Naturally, a big bad wolf arrives to throw a wrench in the proceedings. Colin Farrell continues to show us what a wonderful thespian he truly is and Alicia Bacheleda is intoxicating as the strange woman.  The scene stealer is Alison Barry as the little girl, Annie, who's presence is felt throughout the proceedings even when not on screen. There is nothing more shattering than a child supporting a parent based on the sheer courage and unwavering faith in the enormity of this love and gift that came from the sea.  With breathtaking photography by Christopher Doyle and an ethereal music score combining traditional Irish ballads, 'ONDINE' is a jewel among the countless remakes and sequels being unleashed on the cinema going public.

"Ti West's ""The Innkeepers"" is a tour de force, certainly superior to his debut ""House of the Devil"".  It seems to be a bit under appreciated judging by both the comments here and it's critical reception.  I'm not sure why.  It is a bit like peeling an onion but once you do, you don't cry  you scream.  This is psychological terror at it's most refined and disturbing.Sara Paxton plays Claire, a twenty something working at a reputedly haunted hotel just about to close.  Pat Healy plays the distant and sort of strange Luke, a middle aged man who also works the desk and claims to be interested in using EVP to uncover the hotel's infamous ghost, Madelin O Malley.  Madelin was stiffed on her wedding night, killed herself, and her body was stuffed in the trunk of the hotel's basement.For the first half hour of the film, none of this is given what one would call serious treatment.  Claire and Luke goof around, gossip about the famous aged actress played by Kelly McGillis, and it isn't until Claire begins to take the EVP quest seriously that it gets serious.This may lead the viewer to conclude the tragic ending of the film to be a consequence of Claire's overactive imagination or her asthma.  There are a few other things to consider, though.  Why does Lee, McGillis' character, arrive at night just before things get ghostly?  Why, before urging Claire to leave, does Luke say ""I have something to tell you""?  Was his skepticism a mere front for something else he knew?  Why does Lee's facial profile look so much more youthful the last time we see her?Without giving anything away, it seems to me this is an infinitely more complex movie than most seem to realize.  Absolutely recommended for lovers of horror.  Watch carefully.",Misunderstood and brilliant,1340841600,"06 28, 2012",5,1

"I am a huge Cary Grant fan, I thought I'd seen all of his movies, and today, this gem came to my attention. I sure miss the values, the love and the care for one's family and neighbors as depicted in this movie. I was born in the 60's, so I remember scouting, and the morals and values that were taught. I remember friendly neighborhood children, riding bikes and going to the beach.I didn't expect to get choked up watching this, but I did, as well as laugh out loud at times. This story is about a family with a heart for children. They bring two children who are living in orphanages, into their homes. The transformation that love, discipline, and a home can cause on even the most devastated child. How I wish things could go back to the way they were. I know it wasn't as idyllic as is shown in movies, but I definitely miss those days. I'd give this 10 stars if I could!",What a Wonderful Movie,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",5,1

"I recognized the title as a highly praise book, so I was determined to watch it.  The slow start was necessary to set the stage for the following episodes.  The setting was in the 18th century, but the problems woven into the story are very modern. There were so many characters that it took an entire showing for an introduction.  Actually the variety of characters required the watcher to keep up with the overall story.  Bob&#8217;s Girl",Started Slowly,1396656000,"04 5, 2014",4,1
"I truly enjoyed watching this series  it has so much going for it. The setting is the backbone of ""Hell on Wheels"", and it convincingly brings this strange community (a camp of laborers at the western frontier, where the Union Pacific Railroad is being expanded upon and slowly extending its reach across the United States) to life. I could feel the filth and desperation of this world, as well as the aching backs and blistered hands of the men who were worked to the bone by their merciless ""walking bosses"".Equally strong are the actors who were cast to bring the characters of ""Hell on Wheels"" to life. The two protagonists, Mr. Bohanan and Mr. Ferguson, are absolutely fantastic. Though deeply flawed, I could not help but find myself rooting for them... even though they were oftentimes at odds with each other, making for a somewhat muddled viewing experience. But that is by no means a complaint. This is the result of brilliant writing (and acting), and all who were involved in the process deserve to be commended for their efforts.The only thing holding this first season back from five stars is some tired cliches (the wild eyed preacher, the angry Irishman, etc.), as well as some absurdly gratuitous violence that I feel was included simply because that's the trendy thing to do on cable TV nowadays. I have no problem whatsoever with violence in media, and I thought much of it was well placed in ""Hell on Wheels"". Confrontations between Native Americans and railroad workers made sense, as did the constant disputes among laborers. But do we really need to see things like the well dressed railroad tycoon mutilating bodies in order to make for compelling newspaper photos? The answer is no, my friends. That's in there simply to get a rise out of the viewers. Ugh. Such a boring, tired concept.But by no means should you let these minor criticisms prevent you from watching this series, particularly if you're a fan of period pieces, the HBO series ""Deadwood"" (from which influence was clearly drawn), or American history. This is fantastic television  no question about it. Can't wait for season two.","""This business is not for the weak of heart.

"Its hard not to compare this show to the Following with Kevin Bacon. On the surface, they're very similar. Tortured main character, gruesome murders, creepy psychopaths. Yet, they are, in essence, nothing alike. Bacon's character is a cliche. Will Graham, the protagonist in Hannibal, is so beautifully drawn, I can't take my eyes off him. He is a ""special investigator"" with the FBI. Those who work with him see him as fragile, so much so that they all seem to be holding their collective breath, waiting for him to shatter. The thing that makes him weak in their eyes is his stunning depth of empathy. This is how he solves crimes. Hannibal Lecter, a psychiatrist (and future notorious psychopath) who works with the FBI and Graham, has a different perspective. When Graham asks ""how do you see me?"", Lecter replies, you are ""the mongoose I want under the house when the snakes slither by.""The production quality is high, the supporting cast is great. The show is smartly written.",Fascinating,1365724800,"04 12, 2013",4,1
"If you are a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and mourned the pjazzing of John Thaw at the young age of 60   who was recently voted by British viewers as #3 in the best 50 actors over the past 50 years   you probably know that the show has been revived in the form of a prequel.  The first season was outstanding, and now the second is maintaining the same unrelenting quality, which isn't easy to do.John Thaw, as the older Morse, is clearly irreplaceable. His brooding, melancholy, curmudgeonly Morse captured the inspector's essence. Thaw's own life paralleled Morse's own with the loss of his mother's constant presence in his life at an early age when she left home and he didn't see her again until he was 19. The character Morse's parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother died three years later. Did this life experience help Thaw to capture the depth and underlying strain of unresolved grief in Morse? Is this why Morse constantly falls for the women in his investigations, even when they turn out to be the culprit?But now we have the new younger Morse in this series Endeavour, which is a prequel to the iconic series. In the mystery novels, Morse's mother was Quaker which explains the origin of the name Endeavour. The real story is that the author Colin Dexter supposedly found the name on a building in which boats were housed along the river Thames in Oxford where he liked to walk. And the names Morse and Lewis actually came from arch rival cross word puzzle clue writers whom Dexter knew.Is this new endeavor in its second season worthy of the old series? Definitely yes. The younger Morse (Shaun Evans)is a tad gawky, as you imagine Morse probably was in his early days, but his enjoyment of fine cars, cljazzical music,  crossword puzzles, literature cljazzics is in evidence. The production values are superior to the old series, although the same wonderful iconic music remains. The sets for example  the police station, Morse's new rental, museums, boarding school, pubs   Anglophiles will be delighted in the authenticity representing 1960's England.  The cinematography is original with unusual flashbacks, angles of camera, perspectives or looking through a dirty car window as Morse steps out of a building. You feel the texture of England.  I watch it as much for the scenery as for the plots and actors.The actors are stand outs: Endeavor's boss Thursday (Roger Allam) and the chief of police (Anton Lesser), the other police colleagues, and Morse's new possible love interest are splendid. Fun to watch Morse and Thursday's relationship develop. Since Morse doesn't have Lewis yet, Thursday fills in as the person to which he is closest and their relationship gives the series warmth. It is an inspired choice to use John Thaw's daughter as a newspaper editor   you can see a bit of her father's face in hers.The crimes are appropriately complex with original plots. So, even though we still miss Mr. Thaw, the actor Shaun Evans is maturing comfortably into the role of Morse. We hope the series will continue longer than the first incarnation of Colin Dexter's great books, which is probably my favorite mystery series.  If the quality continues, it certainly has the potential to last a long time for Inspector Morse's old and new delighted devotees.",The Quality Continues,1404950400,"07 10, 2014",5,1

"I'll have to admit, after seeing Mad Men (and just about everything HBO and Showtime had to offer) I was pretty much convinced that there was nothing else worth watching on TV..... happy to be proven wrong.You've probably heard all the hype surrounding Breaking Bad and know about it's premise (dying chemestry teacher becomes Meth dealer to support his family). While this sounded interesting,  I wasn't too impressed....that is until I actually saw the first episode.You already know about the great performances, dark humor (Walt the main character going from timid to fearless) and gritty scenes of drug dealing, but what really sold me on this show was it's honesty. Not just the characters but of how their situations play out and how everything they do effects the world around them.If I had one problem with the show, it's that it's first season is so short. But honestly I'd rather have seven outstanding episodes than a handful of filler between them.This DVD set also has some great commentaries and interviews. I'm very impressed with how much the actors and producers of the show believe in the project and want to see it succeed.I won't pretend that this series is everyone's cup of tea, but if you dig the first episode you'll be in for one of the wildest rides of your life.",One of the best shows EVER.....,1236384000,"03 7, 2009",5,1

"This really was a series that was somewhat dangerous to make, because of how iconic Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of the character Hannibal Lector has become, it is hard to imagine anyone else in that role (even though others have played it).  That said Mads Mikkelsen does a great job making the character his own, and while playing it differently than Hopkins, staying true to the character.  For example his portrayal of Lector is somewhat more reserved and less snarky than Hopkins played him.  That is most likely due to the fact that he is still the hidden monster at this point in the story, and still a well respected member of society.  He is still very much the master manipulator however.The TV show is set about 4 years before the events in Red Dragon.  Only the audience knows who Lecter really is (and what he is really serving for dinner), which actually makes watching the events unfold very exciting.  There is always an element of will he be found out that goes on in almost every episode. The series actually revolves as much (if not more so) around the character of Will Graham (played by Hugh Dancy), who is in this version an empathic who can get in the minds of a killer and see how the victims are killed.  Jack Crawford (played by Laurence Fishburne) brings Graham in as a to profile serial killers.  He is shown as very gifted but mentally unstable, and Lecter (who is almost an ancillary character in the first couple episodes) is his psychiatrist and is committing some of the murders being investigated.The series has a lot going for it.  Great acting, writing and special effects are at the top of the list.  The special effects are so good in fact that if you have a weak stomach you may not want to watch after eating because there are some very gory death scenes.  They are as gory as anything you see on a lot of cable shows.  It really is a show that you have to watch from the beginning because there are a lot of story arcs that carry throughout the season.  Some of the episodes have a ""story of the week"" flavor to them, but there are a couple story lines that keep coming back over and over.As far as the blu ray set, the series looks and sounds great.  Thankfully it plays in a season mode that allows you to pick up where you left off if you stop it.  There are a lot of special features including extended episodes, commentary on selected episodes, deleted scenes, a gag reel, and a few making of behind the scenes featurettes.  In all there is a lot there for those who like bonus material.  If you are a fan of the books and or movies, this definitely does them justice and is worth checking out.",A show that tells the story of a young Hannibal Lecter,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",5,1

"AMERICAN HORROR STORY: ASYLUM (Season Two) takes the series to an even higher level of creepiness than Season One.Be warned, this show is not family viewing fun and those with weak hearts might want to stay away. If horror is your genre, then ASYLUM is not to be missed. The writers take us on a journey into a terrifying Asylum for the Insane run by not so saintly Catholic nuns. Be ready to squirm in your chair as you start this journey.Lovely Jessica Lange returns to AMERICAN HORROR STORY as Sister Jude. She runs BRIARCLIFF MENTAL INSTITUTION with a zeal that could melt steel. She's a troubled woman with a mysterious past and no heart or compjazzion for the inmates who are often more sane than their keepers. Decades have pjazzed since her days as a screen sex symbol yet her sexiness hasn't faded. Here is one cljazzy American actress not afraid to age gracefully to celebrate the lines in her once smooth porcelain face. It is a joy to see her back in Season Two in an even more diabolical role. Sister Jude the tormentor becomes the tormented. Lange delves into all sides of her role and does a fun fantasy scene where she sings the 60's song THE NAME GAME in her fantasy mind to the inmates. A fun break from the horrors we are all experiencing.Speaking about diabolical, how about a young innocent nun suddenly possessed by the devil? Throw in space aliens terrorizing some inmates and add in a demented doctor who may or may not have been a doctor in a Nazi Concentration camp. How do the writers find such juicy characters to fill the screen?Sister Jude has writer Lana Winters (Sarah Paulson) when she starts poking into the despicable conditions at Briarwood. Kit Walker (Evan Peters) has been sent to the institution for psychological evaluation after being arrested as the serial killer BLOODY FACE. Both are terrorized by Sister Jude and the evil Dr. Arden (James Cromwell). Kit and Lana join forces to escape and expose the evils of Briarwood but evil doctors and nuns and other worldly aliens keep getting in the way.ASYLUM is truly addictive. Each episode brings a new twist and another failed escape. The cast is just perfect in their roles as Season One Alumni Zachary Quinto and Dylan McDermottr return to ASYLUM. This cast was made in heaven. Singer Adam Levine is even in the mix. Lily Rabe is uncanny and mesmerizing as the sweet, innocent nun Sister Mary Eunice possessed by the devilThe episodes are scary and twisted. James Cromwell is the murderous Dr. Arden doing unspeakable experiments on the patients. Naomi Grossman also deserves special note as Pepper, the tragic ""pinhead."" The make up artists did a remarkable job of turning her into Pepper.One disappointment are the final two episodes where the writers seemed to have felt rushed to wrap up the series with a nice neat bow. No questions remain unanswered and everything is neatly resolved. The fates of all characters are clear and sometimes there is no need to cleanly end a series. The horror aspect is gone in the last two episodes though there is some suspense as the story is neatly finished. The writers seemed to skip a beat towards the end to just finally end the series.This series is so deliciously scary and viewer discretion is advised. The horror factor will unnerve many people but this is one amazing series full of twists and turns and characters are never who they seem to be. Well written, well acted and set in the perfect dismal, hopeless setting brings a realism to this show unparalled. If you like horror stories, don't miss ASYLUM.",DELICIOUSLY CREEPY  AND EERY,1381881600,"10 16, 2013",5,1

All I can say is that, written and directed by Nicholas Jarecki, the film keeps us guessing what's next, following the story of this complicated man struggling to save what he holds dear.But the reason the film works is the presence of Richard Gere (nominated for Golden Globe), one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. You may not like the man he plays, but Gere makes the tormented protagonist more interesting than the usual stock character. The cast includes Susan Sarandon, Tim Roth, Brit Marling, Laetitia Casta, Nate Parker, and Graydon Carter, editor of ""Vanity Fair.""As a thriller or a morality tale, ""Arbitrage"" does not offer anything new, but with Richard Gere's superb performance and Yorick Le Saux's lush cinematography, the film is a pretty entertaining ride.","(3.5 STARS) Thanks to Richard Gere, Fine Character Study in the Guise of a Thriller",1364342400,"03 27, 2013",4,1

"This spinoff of The Closer is better in many ways, but I still recommend folks watch The Closer first since most of the characters are the same in Major Crimes and watchers of Major Crimes will get a better idea of the character history if they watch The Closer FIRST.Where Major Crimes differs from The Closer is they have introduced a fabulous storyline involving a teenage boy who is a witness to a crime.  The storyline evolves and the end result is it gives more heart and sole to this program than its predecessor, The Closer.  There are times I am just in tears on how well Graham Patrick Martin portrays &#34;Rusty&#34; in this program because it is such a fantastic performance.

"Nine Things about &#34;Here Comes the Devil&#34;1. This Mexican horror film could have been really good. But I ended up being pretty disappointed with it.2. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be   a serial killer movie, a demonic possession movie, a psychological thriller, or &#34;Paranormal Activity&#34; (I mean, can we stop with the levitating above the bed thing?).3. It starts out with a lesbian sex scene that has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. Then one of the lesbians gets her fingers cut off.  A few minutes later, a mom has sex with her husband in a car while her kids disappear.4. When the kids come back, they're acting all weird. Like they have either been molested, or possessed. The parents try to solve the problem by taking the matter into their own hands. It doesn't work.5. There are little clues all the way through to hint at what's going on. The problem is, the clues don't make any sense, either.6. You know the old horror movie truism that if you have sex, you get killed? This movie teaches something similar, except the lesson is that if a woman enjoys sex, she will either be mutilated or put she will put her children in mortal danger.7.  On the plus side, it does dare to take on subjects that American movies won't. Like middle school siblings having sex with each other.8. It's got a nice film style, and some individual scenes are chilling. It just doesn't add up to anything, because it doesn't even know where it's heading.9.

"Amanda Seyfried is an incredible actress.  In addition, she's a unique beauty and her body is seduction in motion. I have been so used to seeing her in captivating films that when I heard about ""Lovelace""  being made I figured the film would be another interesting indulgence .My thoughts were greatly diminished after viewing , in fact I was in disappointment mode way less than halfway into the film. Seyfried had the right goods for the part, even more so than the real Linda but she just wasn't believable, nor were many of the characters. For a supposedly linear movie it was extremely non cohesive.When Linda enters the world of porn, there is no real feeling of shock. She also  never really questions her lascivious acts early on for someone so brand new. The movie seemed rushed with bits and pieces missing. I'm no raunch fanatic but for a film made in 2012 2013 about the porn industry of the 70s, this was very tame, and every sex scene looked beyond fake. I understand the acters can't really have sex but I've seen more bump and grind in PG13 films..Linda's interactions with her mother and father never explain her life which is what I was hoping for. There were no overtly religious tones throughout.  Also I  found Linda's boyfriend to be a cardboard character that I didn't love to hate, I just hated. I really expected a deeper character development and a capturing of the 70s that never fully panned out. This could have been a fascinating take on a strange pjazzing in time. Unfortunately it was a very poor film that was matched only by the poor happenings it attempted to depict.I even held out hope that as the movie came to a close there would either have been some kind of ""aha"" moment or a sense of completion. Instead it rang hollow. An overall bad project for Amanda Seyfried and company.",A case of actually being truly disappointed.,1391212800,"02 1, 2014",2,-1

This films give you virtually no one to identify with.

"To start with, once again we are seeing some suspiciously polished five star reviews. This show, however, is not at all five star worthy by any honest stretch of the imagination. The show has low production values, low budget actors, and consequently poor acting. And for a crime show it makes leaps and jumps that make it impossible to follow, which means there is no chance that the viewer will ever figure out who the killer is. As well, there is a lot of product placement    even more so then usual nowadays. The show also is something of a surreptitious pro smoking cigarette commercial, with all the young hip, cool people conspicuously enjoying   really enjoying    their cigarettes. That this show lasted four years is more of an indictment on our society and our exceedingly low expectations than any evidence that it was a ""successful"" program.

"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.Scott Waugh brings the successful video game to the big screen.  I expect the film be in the running for worst film of the year.  I was lured in to see some cool cars (especially the Shelby Mustang), some cool driving sequences and wasn't expecting much else.  There was one surprise.  A pretty good soundtrack which for me was highlighted by Jamie Common's version of Dylan's ""All Along The Watchtower.""  So I was satisfied with my reason for going.  But still, I love movies and was expecting something more than this claptrap.The so called plot consists of garage owner, Tobey Marshall (Aaron Paul) a wannabe race car driver agreeing to spruce up a Mustang owned by his high school nemesis, Dino Brewster (Dominic Cooper).  Dino has gotten hands on the Mustang being developed by Ford and Carroll Shelby that wasn't finished after Shelby died.  Once Tobey and his misfits of a crew fix up the car, they would get a quarter of the sales price, expected to be in the neighborhood of $3 million.In a just for fun match race between Tobey, Dino and a close friend (Harrison Gilbertson) of Tobey's who also happens to be Dino's girlfriend's younger brother and she happens to be the former girlfriend (Dakota Johnson) of Tobey's.  Well, high speeds on city streets can be dangerous and you guessed it, something bad happens. This all leads to an eventual big balls takes all shootout in northern California and Tobey and his now sold Mustang's new owner's jazzociate Julia (Imogen Poots), now must cross country to get to the big 6 car race where the winner gets all the cars.This story is so full of holes it's just absurd.  About every 5 minutes something really dumb happens.  Here's an example.  Since Tobey is behind schedule, he decides to gas up while on the fly.  His compatriots are always nearby in a truck that somehow manages to keep up with the 230 mph Mustang.  So this little bit of putting gas in the tank while flying down the freeway, is followed a few scenes later with them stopping to get gas and allow Julie to change clothes or something.If you must, see it for the cars...and there are some beauties including a Bugatti, GTA Spano, Lamborghini Gallardo, Mercedes Benz McLaren, McLaren P1, etc. and some great stunt driving.","Beautiful cars, great stunt driving, terrible movie",1395100800,"03 18, 2014",2,-1

I am SICK of seeing Steve & Wood Harris ugly faces, they should&#8217;ve been left in the 90&#8217;s where they belong (all they ever play is THUG roles anyway). I actually got excited when I saw David Rapaport (He&#8217;s a great actor. He can be gansta, dramatic, or comedic so I was game for whatever he was going to do *lol*) then I was soon disappointed when I saw that he was playing a greasy hillbilly gator poacher.

What&#8217;s the deal with casting the ugliest skanky looking women to bang Rayland *lol* but yet the estranged wife (who is beautiful) wants nothing else to do with him. What talent less casting director (who apparently got their job by sleeping with the producer) is responsible for all of this?It is also apparent that the writers are now lazy p0t heads, because the script is truly failing in this season. The character Rayland Givens gets entirely too much camera time. He needs his role cut WAY down to about 12% (or zero). At this point I don't even want to hear from the Rayland character anymore.......... and STOP bringing that smart (but dumb as heck) teen Loretta back to the show. She's boring and annoying. You sent her off to a foster home,now leave her there. You all have gone totally over board with the bloody murder scenes.

"THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild   especially at the Graysons. Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother's memorial service, the pregnant mother's swan dive at her baby shower, and the groom's arrest for murder at his wedding. My favorite character, the unpredictable Nolan Ross, played by Gabriel Mann, is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.It's not looking good for him in Season Three either.Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their ""Count of Monte Cristo"" revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format   and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon. For me, it's not as good as Season One, where Emily Thorne (Emily Van Camp) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives. I miss those photos, where she would cross off the guilty with a big red ""X"" after executing a clever payback.Now   surprise!   Emily has a boyfriend, a hunk she met in Master Takeda's school for revenge. There was no mention of this in Season One, but we are dealing with soap opera rules now, like is Amanda's baby Jack's or the result of a one night stand? Two major characters get over the top death scenes (where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not. They do.)Cinematography is excellent again, making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery, gorgeous sets and high fashion style. Madeleine Stowe, playing matriarch Victoria Grayson, wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode; the designer is recognized in the end credits, too. Sound is just fine for this dialogue driven show; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries: executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy, and writer co executive producer Michael Foley on ""Illusion""; executive producer writer Mark B. Perry, writer executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler (Jack) and Margarita Levieva (Amanda)on another, and creator executive producer writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on ""Truth, Part Two."" The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three, so be on guard.There are three interesting featurettes: ""Schooled in Revenge,"" that gives us a peek at Master Takeda's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance; ""The Sound of Revenge,"" showing how iZLER composes music for the series; and ""Haute Hamptons: Dressing Miss Davenport"" with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters, focusing on Ashley Madekwe, who plays Ashley Davenport this time.

"This movie could have been great. Should have been with an exciting concept, but with all the down right absurd events and idiotic things people do just to move a plot to its intended destination, all with complete disregard for character development or common sense, ruined the whole thing. Example: people go out to repair ship with out being tethered to anything but each other, with expected results, fluid used in ship circuits (or something not sure where exactly) will poison the entire ship and kill everyone without a mechanism to decontaminate or clean spacesuits, people have to gather samples by hand, no robots I guess, people go out on their own and run off by themselves doing whatever the they want to on obviously unstable ice. No one is leading this mess, no commander. It's entirely rediculous, the whole thing. None of these crew members were professional, com pentane or effective. They were immature and stupid.

"""Touch"" has characteristics of a well crafted TV drama; namely, well developed characters and a premise which is unique and initially engaging. However, once all the components of the story are jazzembled, the result is dull and contrived. Ultimately, everything will work out because the numbers say so. That's about it. So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get go. The numbers are little more than an omnipotent deus ex machina, and there's no real mystery, wonder, or drama to the plot resolutions they achieve.

"To begin, I'm not the biggest ""alien"" fan.  However, I absolutely love the ""found footage"" genre of films and will take a chance on pretty much any I come across.  Let me be clear, the problem with this movie ISN'T in the production, acting, sound, or anything of that nature.  The problem I had with the film was the fact that I just didn't find it all that interesting.  Honestly, I'm not 100% sure what could have been done to remedy this problem?  The entire movie is based on ""found footage"" recorded by the youngest member of the Morris family, Riley (Riley Polanski).  Riley suffers from a form of autism and the video camcorder helps him cope with the world around him.  It's a pretty straight forward ride here.The Morris family is on vacation and decides to take a trip to Brown Mountain in North Carolina.  While camping one night, Riley is awaken by strange lights.  He wakes his brother, Corey (Corey Eid) and sister, Jillian (Jillain Clare) to inspect what he is looking at.  Three lights appear in the sky overhead and quickly shoot out of sight.  This is apparently an ongoing phenomenon that occurs in North Carolina and is simply known as the Brown Mountain Lights.Riley continues to film the vacation and eventually the family gets lost in twisty mountain roads.  When they come upon a tunnel, they discover numerous cars that have been vacated suddenly and are blocking the road ahead.  When their dad, Peter (Peter Holden) gets out to inspect, the 3 guys head inside while Jillian and her mom, Katie (Katherine Sigismund) go for a bathroom break.  While inside the tunnel the 3 come face to face with the problem.From here on out, it's basically footage of Riley and family rushing around and LOTS of super bright, blue lights shining through a variety of objects.  There is around 5 minutes of actual ""alien"" shots and about 1 minute of the ""abduction"".  Just seemed to me that I spent 95% of the movie WAITING for something to happen and when it finally did, it was over.Final Verdict:  PASS!If this review has helped you, please click the ""yes"" button below to let me know.

"When I was little, I used to despise watching this program, and I only hate it more now. Every episode, of course, is repetitive (I know it is a nursery schoolers' television cartoon, but there are more educational, entertaining series out there, such as ""Little Bear"" or ""Little Bill"", that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously) and predictable, even for a three year old child. When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall breaking cartoon character's questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her.

I have watched five episodes and wonder when people will start to understand the food and gas are going to run out.  Most characters seem to have gone on with their lives and find the dome a minor inconvenience after after the first episode. I  have seen the black actress in two series, does she think she is the new Yul Bryner?  Poor writing (not King's fault), incredibly poor acting, and implausible plot.  Could someone tell me why the outside  government makes no attempt to have a real conversation with the people inside, maybe help them understand something about the dome?

Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new ""strength"".  In the fight scenes she couldn't fight here way out of a wet paper bag.  One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise, no broken bones nothing.  When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing.

"&#34;Almost Human&#34; is shorter than &#34;Cloverfield&#34; and has around an 8 minute end credit sequence solely to be long enough to be entered into the festival circuit. This may make it seem like the sci fi horror film is rushed along, but its fast pace is actually fairly comfortable and it fits the film very well. The film draws influences from some of the most respectable cult cljazzics. The opening credits and the film mostly taking place in the middle of the woods gives it a &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; atmosphere while the music seems like the forgotten score John Carpenter never released. As the film progresses, you're immediately reminded of &#34;The Thing&#34; and &#34;Halloween&#34; during the final act. The violent, murderous rampage also has some better than decent yet not quite great gore thanks to its practical makeup effects.It's difficult to root for Seth though because he's so twitchy. While Jen seems to have forgotten everything that happened the night Mark disappeared, Seth just wants to wake her up to the nightmarish sights and sounds he does remember. He isn't heroic and he doesn't want to save anyone. He just wants his life to go back to normal after Jen told the media that he was behind everything and it ruined his life. In other words, Seth only cares about himself.There's this entire sequence where Seth doesn't seem to understand anything anyone is telling him. He mutters the phrase, &#34;What's that supposed to mean,&#34; several times in less than five minutes. Mark always seems to ask questions without giving anyone a chance to actually answer. He asks a man cutting firewood why he's living in his house before blasting him with a shotgun and thrusting a hatchet into the back of his skull before the poor guy can give an actual answer. Seth is trying to load a rifle while Jen is in trouble. He&#8217;s rushed and in a panic, but can&#8217;t seem to get any of the shells into the actual gun. So he just throws the entire supply on the floor. While the film has several positive influences, the other influences aren't so great. &#34;Jason Goes to Hell&#34; is pjazzable since the acting in that sequel is some of the best in the &#34;Friday the 13th&#34; series, but &#34;Almost Human&#34; is a lot like &#34;Dreamcatcher&#34; at the end of the day and that's something no film should try to ride the coattails of.&#34;Almost Human&#34; would be a decent first film for anyone, but its abrupt ending and familiarities hurt it more than anything else. Nothing is really explained by the end of the film and you're left wondering why aliens have a thing about turning our televisions on, making prank calls, turning the lights on and off, and possess impregnating elongated mouth funnels. While &#34;Almost Human&#34; pays homage to some truly great horror and sci fi films of the past, it fails to really personify its own identity and it crumbles under the weight of paying too much homage without building its own foundation.",'Almost Human' review: Screech and suck to superiority,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2,-1
"Margot (Michelle Williams)meets Daniel (Luke Kirby)and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction. But Margot is married to Lou (Seth Rogen), a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist. Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou. She craves excitement. As luck would have it, Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another. After over an hour of teasing, including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot, they succumb. Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind. But by the end of the movie, Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore. One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled. As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman, we see a bunch of older bodies, sagging breasts, pendulous breasts, flabby tummies, wrinkled backsides. What is this for? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all? Do we need reminding? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three way sex were also like peepshow parades. Who does that kind of stuff?

"I've been an avid fan of the BBC show Being Human for several years now. I love it, love the actors and acting and feel it is a great show. It was with some trepidation that I finally decided to watch the U.S. version. Needless to say I was underwhelmed. I already think it's weird and more than a little creepy that apparently there is so little original material floating around on TV and at the movies that anything that reeks of any success is snatched up and copied over and over again ad nauseum. I hate the word ""reboot"" for anything but computers and this TV show, which I dub a complete ripoff is no exception.Yes, they don't exactly copy the BBC version but there's still plenty of similar enough plot lines for me to wonder about the ethics of whoever is writing the show. Can't come up with something original? Fine, watch the U.K. version then alter the plot lines a bit, rename the characters and call it a brand new endeavor. Riiight. And part of what I love about the U.K. version is that the people actually look like real people, men and women that I know and would actually talk to  even the pretty and handsome ones. In short, they're real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets. The US. version however again gives us Ken and Barbie Doll perfection with people who look like mannequins grabbed off a runway from Paris or Italy. Honestly they could slap those same characters into an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or The OC or Dawson's Creek and no one would even notice the difference. Whereas if George, Nina, Annie, Tom or Mitchell found themselves on one of those shows the first words out their mouths would likely be, ""Bloody hell, what's all this nonsense? Do you people even know how to hoover let alone stake a vampire who's trying to kill your mates?""Where the U.K. version actually manages to say something intelligent about the human condition in all its facets and at the same time pack in some very funny, touching clever little moments the U.S. version is just another pale bloodless version of pretty people with problems  or in this case pretty supernatural people with problems.

"I am going to admit that this is the first time i watched Teen Wolf. So this is the review for people who are thinking about getting one DVD in a continuing series and catching up. I'm sure there are plenty of reviews for people who have been watching the show from the beginning and want to know if they can expect great things or disappointment.But as far as I can tell, this show is about a lot of pretty white twenty somethings who are pretending to be high school students and keep turning into werewolves and killing each other. In one episode, they are on the school bus the whole time. In another episode there are references to red eyes and green eyes. Everyone is talking about alphas. The Greek letters are like the semi finals on Glee   they sure make sense for people who care. Not much for casual viewers.There's also a lot of mood music being played. And the town has a lot of people dying. It's one of those fictional towns where the murder rate would be high in a major metropolitan area and yet no one moves away.There's also a flashback episode where both storytellers are outright lying. That one has some wit.Beyond that, the characters all look alike. Sure, there's the cop from The Wire playing a veterinarian. However, everyone else looks like an Ambercrombie & Fitch model and there's no way to tell them apart. I understand that this is MTV and its audience is more superficial than most, but does EVERY single character have to be blandly good looking without much variation? It would be much easier keeping the people straight if you they included an Asian character, a black &#34;teenager&#34; (everyone in the show looks like they have books about quarter life crisis tucked away) or even a character that is fat or &#34;Hollywood ugly&#34; (Rachel Leah Cook in gljazzes would be a variation as far as this show it concerned.)If you love this show, I'm sure you'll be fine with it.

"What a mess. First time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011's megahitBridesmaidsdoes but frankly doesn't take them far enough to be remotely funny. In fact, I laughed only once during the film's 91 minute running time (it was the line about Michael Jackson). That's too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first cljazz cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation, leaden pacing, and gags that are overly deliberate in execution. The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together &agrave; laThe Hangoverfor a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend's big wedding. The bride to be is Becky, a former geek whom the trio viciously called ""Pig Face"" in high school behind her back. Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least, the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan, the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids. Although resentful of Becky's happiness, she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch, a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky's wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena. The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party. So many moments ring false including the set up and the lightning flash changes in the characters just to service the plot, but at least the cast is game. Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride inMelancholia, Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness. I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable. Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played inWedding Crashers, Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen's go for broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act, Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant. Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner, while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan's foil. I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells, star of Broadway'sThe Book of Mormon, play Katie's flamboyant co worker and the party stripper. Rebel Wilson, who played Kristen Wiig's brain dead roommate inBridesmaids, has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky, though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch. Speaking of which, Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last ditch effort to deepen the characters. It doesn't really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then. It's no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word of mouth will likely sink the film's chances at the box office. At least at home, the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch, a big mistake on my part.",Bridesmaids Gone Bad...Really Bad,1344988800,"08 15, 2012",1,-1

"I have always been intrigued by the Amityville killings and the hauntings (i.e. ""Horror""). I have found the film itself to be one of the better made horror films in its genre due to its supposed true story. I even red the Jay Ansen book and found that just as scary. Even if in the back of my mind, my beliefs through the years have turned a little cynical with the validity of this tale, my child brain still believes in a fascinated way. So I continue to explore some new information.This new entry into the world of the Amityville Drama is about Daniel Lutz, step son of George and son Kathy Lutz. Throughout the film, Daniel emphasizes his hate towards George. He is filled with anger at almost every step and seems to never let go of this, despite his therapeutic efforts to either resolve the issue or at least get to the truth of it.This documentary does neither to explore the truth or his own personal anger, but rather carries the torch that George and Kathy had started out in 1979 about the hauntings of the house. His descriptions of the happenings in the house are virtually a verbatim of either the book or the movie. If anyone knows anything about Hollywood ""true stories"" they almost never follow the reality in favor of embellishment for the entertainment value, as well never follow the narrative of a book as some things are unfit for movie adaptations for purposes of translating. So what we are left with is an angry guy who decides to take his own cut of the Amityville Horror in the wake of his parents death.The documentary filmmaker, Lauren Dido (?), does not seem to uncover anything. Nor does she ask the right questions. But just incites Daniel half of the time. It is almost as if this is just another scam, in the same way George, Kathy and Jay put together the book and later the movie. This telling, however, is much less successful. I think for those who just need to find out what is in this documentary will want to watch it despite any review will have to decide for themselves about what is in this. Even though I fall into that category, I personally found it dull, boring and insulting.","Promising, but Ultimately Wasted Time",1365984000,"04 15, 2013",1,-1

"Horror fans will likely recognize Joe Swanberg as the nerve grating older brother that was shot in the back with an arrow in ""You're Next"" and probably remember the disturbing short he directed for ""V H S"" involving Emily, the bump on her arm, and aliens. ""Drinking Buddies"" is a more lighthearted but genuine side of the multi talented (actor, director, writer, producer, and often cinematographer) Swanberg. The comedy is noteworthy for being completely improvised and having no script. While the film's spontaneity is admirable, the awkward structure of ""Drinking Buddies"" restrains it from making much of an impact overall.""Drinking Buddies"" is really an appropriate name for the film. Not only does it describe Kate and Luke's relationship perfectly, but the film is mostly people sitting around talking while drinking. It's a simple concept, but at the same time it's as if you're getting the chance to become a part of the daily lives of these characters. Getting into that mindset is a serious plus since it makes it seem like there's much more depth to these characters than there really is.This is where the film's impulsive nature starts to work against it. While there are key events in the film that drive the story along everything in between feels rather unremarkable. The film is a comedy, but nothing really makes you laugh. Maybe it'll be different for people who actually drink. In between the comedy, there isn't enough drama or enough romance to really make you care about the few twists and turns along the way. You're mostly just witnessing strangers talk at a bar or in an apartment and it's expected to be amusing. The resolve isn't very satisfying either. There's obviously a connection between Kate and Luke, but the choices they make don't really make any sense. They show all the emotions of jealous lovers, but never really capitalize on that. You've probably never seen a movie end with the pjazzing of a banana, but you're about to.""Drinking Buddies"" is the type of film that seems like it was a really fascinating idea on paper. Being nearly entirely improvised deserves some sort of recognition, but at the same time it lacks the absorbing qualities a polished script and amusing story can contribute. Jake Johnson and Olivia Wilde give some pjazzionate performances, but ""Drinking Buddies"" is otherwise nothing more than a drunken blur that you'll likely forget about by morning.

"Co produced by Hostel maestro Eli Roth, The Sacrament is the new film by Ti West, an independent director who has earned fans with slow burning and old fashioned supernatural genre films, including The House of the Devil.  The plot is set in motion when a fashion photographer is contacted by his estranged sister, a long term drug user.  Claiming she is rehabilitated, she reveals she is now living abroad in an isolated Christian commune, which she invites him to visit.  With a pair of journalists from the alternative magazine VICE in tow, he travels into the jungle to find her and investigate.  Beyond a fence guarded by men with machine guns, they find a serene, technology free agricultural community lorded over by &#34;Father,&#34; a charismatic preacher.  Father's disciples argue for peace, love, and freedom from the pace of the modern world, but dangerous secrets lie beneath the surface.There is no point in denying or dancing around this fact:  Father is a super thinly fictionalized representation of James &#34;Jim&#34; Jones, the notorious Indiana born religious leader who, in the late 1970s, led his legion of believers, consisting largely of impoverished African Americans, to Guyana and later forced them to commit suicide rather than contend with outside intrusion.  He also ordered the murder of Leo Ryan, a California politician with a particular interest in investigating cults, and four others at a nearby airfield on the same day.  I knew The Sacrament drew inspiration from Jones and the tragedy he wrought before watching the film, but it made me far more uncomfortable than I expected.  In many respects, the film adheres to the true story beat for beat except Ryan and his colleagues are replaced by the VICE reporters, and the plot is revealed via their cameras (a &#34;found footage&#34; format).  The dual aims&#8212;to build suspense and tease the audience in the interest of popcorn entertainment while also recreating Jones' enormous crime&#8212;clash against each other rather than coalesce.There is, I admit, admirable craftsmanship and showmanship on display as suspense slowly mounts via nervous sideways glances and other modest indications of the nightmare to come.  West is as ever a master of subtle time release dread.  However, by the time the images we cannot help but anticipate do come (babies administered poison via a syringe, elderly men and women holding each other as they taste the poisoned juice), they send one's mind to an extreme and haunting place, and it is distasteful to see them blended with footage of co star Joe Swanberg racing around the jungle playing a game of Paranormal Activity.  In my personal opinion, West's well honed directorial gifts and the imposing, magnetic performance of Gene Jones as Father are worthy of a certain amount of objective praise, but nothing compensates for the resulting nausea as a grotesque event which resulted in over 900 futile deaths is exploited for empty headed, sensationalist entertainment.  Other people's mileage will surely vary.",Ti West is a genuine talent led astray here by bad taste,1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2,-1

Third, the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they haven't even cured cancer. A society enlightend and advanced as this(at least 100 200 years or more advanced than earth) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and or outlawed it.

"Dario Argento takes a dump on Bram Stoker's cljazzic story with this amateurish, cheap and dull production of Dracula.  Argento has never been known for thought provoking cinema, and more often than not his stories feature an abundance of style over substance.  Here, even the style comes off as schlocky and cheesy, and not in a &#34;so bad it's good&#34; way either.  The entire cast doesn't speak English as a first language, and it shows in their performances.  With few exceptions, they all come off as stiff and wooden, with lifeless line readings.  Even Rutger Hauer, who has given some terrific performances in his career, is on auto pilot here.  The only actor in the entire cast who really looks like he's enjoying himself is Thomas Kretschmann, who plays the titular Count.  And at times, it looks and sounds like he's doing his best Bela Lugosi impression.  Moving on, as this is a horror movie from Argento, it can be expected that there is a certain amount of blood and gore (along with some amusing female nudity).  While it certainly delivers in that department, the effects still look cheap and fake.  Also worth mentioning for how bad it is, the whole production has the look and feel of a made for TV drama, in everything from the staging and camerawork to the image quality.  A lot of the sets look like sets, and the CGI background enhancements in some scenes is jarring.  The visual effects are also disappointingly bad.  I already mentioned the blood and gore, but there's also a poorly done effect of bodies turning to ash as well as a laughably bad (but incredibly short) scene where Dracula attacks someone in the form of a (CGI) praying mantis(!).  On that note, in this movie Dracula doesn't just take the form of a bat, but also flies, roaches, wolves(?) and the aforementioned praying mantis.  Finally, even though I saw this in 2D, it was actually made for (and shot in) 3D.  Other than being a marketing gimmick, I can't possibly see how it would have benefited this piece of tripe.  Overall, it's best just to avoid this &#34;so bad it's horrible&#34; movie.

"Watched it for FREE on Netflix. I usually look for a show there before I buy on Amazon. Netflix NEVER has all seasons of ANY show & never current episodes. Amazon does, however, have ALL episodes of every series they sell the day after they air  on TV. Well anyway.... I watched season 1 there,if it were any good I would have bought season 2 on Amazon but this show was NOT good. I gave it 2 Stars because it DID keep me from being bored to death while I was working. So 2 Satrs is me being &#34;nice&#34;.Too much in this series annoyed me. Like how useless law enforcement was. So many idiotic mistakes & unrealistic behavior. Several FBI agents were kidnapped. How does this happen? One of them KNEW something was up (right before they snatched him up) and didn't respond the way someone with FBI TRAINING should have. He just scurried on up to his hotel room like a scared civilian frantically trying to open his hotel room door. I said &#34;They're gonna be in his room. Watch!&#34;, then *BAM* soon as he walks in the cult members are in his room waiting. Too predictable. The &#34;bad guys&#34; kept getting away! Even in situations where there's no way in hell they should have. In a hostage situation, since WHEN does FBI, SWAT, Local law enforcement leave (or pretend to leave) when the bad guys demand them to do so? How do 3 guys take out 3 dozen FBI agents with ease? Why do the &#34;bad guys&#34; ALWAYS get away by sneaking out the back door when the house building is supposedly surrounded by cops? Even with a police officer RIGHT THERE in the hallway outside of Clair's bedroom (while her door was open) a FAT cult member slowly drops out of the ceiling (like Spider Man) kills the cop with out making a peep then takes her hostage..... Really!?Joe Carrol & Clair's son, was a smart DUMB kid. One minute the kids does something extremely clever, the next minute he does something extremely dumb (even for a kid).The main thing that irked me is..... No one behaved as if an infinite number of anonymous serial killer cult members were running around killing random innocent people,blowing up stuff, kidnapping kids women, and kidnapping & torturing FBI. No one was taking this seriously enough for me. Like when Ryan & Claire were held up at his FBI friend's cabin. Soon as they found that a GPS tracking device was planted on Claire (by a cult member) they should have LEFT IMMEDIATELY. Instead they stay and plan on leaving in the next day (WTF!?) in the meantime Ryan's friend finds ONE shot gun and a half empty box of shells. Mind you, they know that they're being hunted by select cult members with extreme military C.I.A training (and military grade fire power) that just murdered 3 dozen FBI agents an hour ago. Of course, soon as night falls here comes the bad guys AGAIN.The one victim that survived being attacked by Joe Carrol (forgot her name) didn't act like someone who just found out the serial killer that almost stabbed her to death just broke out of prison. This girl (and her friends) acted like she just lost her cat dog and was a little bummed out over it. If that were me...After the attack, I would've already had an arsenal in my home. After being notified Joe Carrol escaped, I wouldn't take a piss without a 9mm (loaded with hollow points) sitting on the vanity. I would've purchased two highly trained German Shepard dogs, that would've slept in bedroom every night. I also would've spent the last 7 yrs doing some type of NavySeals C.I.A JasonBorne combat training, and at the riffle range 5 days a week. This is the type of behavior you'd expect from someone that had gone through such a tragic ordeal.Police protection or &#34;Protective Custody&#34; is a JOKE in every low budget movie series. Am I supposed to be surprised that the 50 cops outside & inside of the victim's home wasn't going to stop the &#34;bad guys&#34; from getting to them?

"MY TITLE SUMS UP THIS MOVIE TO A TEE. The story is about a couple (an American guy and a British girlfriend) who invite a male cousin (wink...wink) of the girlfriend on a camping trip in the Engish woods that are inhabited by witches. The Yank has his camcorder on at all times and is annoying his girlfriend to no end. Hence the found footage formate and the way this story is presented. For a found footage film it didn't make me sea sick with the shakey cam work like most seem to do and some of the steady cam shots of the landscape were nicely shot.There is tension between the two guy's for obvious reasons and makes you wonder what was the girl thinking. For me that was the most intriguing part of the whole story because the rest consisted of some conversations between the three,a road trip, a visit to a pub for a background on the story from the locals point of view, a hike to the woods with cows, sheep and horses, the camp site, more conversation, a chase, camp again, another chase, camp yet again and the the last chase THE END.There is some violence and little blood, very little suspense or tension, a make out scene that turns ugly and some foul language with no nudity.THIS IS AN IDEAL MOVIE FOR KIDS TO WATCH,  WHO YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET TO FALL ASLEEP NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED.

"To put it shortly Season 1 was great. The story was fresh, the dynamics between the characters were interesting, the photography was gorgeous and to back it all up with had this tale and storyline of a woman attempting revenge on her father's ex employee who framed him for a crime he didn't commit. Splendid! You could almost feel the essence of the story it did seem like a cljazzic tale however this series unfortunately has extended itself too long and over welcomed it's stay.What was once a thrilling story of seeking justice, double crossing, plotting and betrayal is now nothing but an over exaggerated, melodramatic and annoying scene after scene of muffled twists and turns. Too many things are thrown at us it's hard to keep track of what exactly is going on. Too much of something is really not that good and sometimes simplicity is key!It's one thing to create a masterful logic complicated plot, to keep things interesting however it's a completely another matter to hoard this plot to death! The purpose of Emily's ever existence in the lives of the Graysons was to seek revenge and that idea although persistent and toyed with is no longer the spotlight of the series I'm afraid.A plot about revenge is never intended to take this long, this story would've made much more sense and would've been fantastic if it was introduced as a mini series of 10 episodes per season instead of a full on show. Much less complications and far more superior writing. If we were to crop out all the unnecessary details and uncalled for twists and turns we would've ended summing up the whole 3 seasons to a 2 hour movie. That's just how much contrived scenarios are being shoved down our throat. Of course the viewer can't help but watch out of curiosity for what's going to happen next and how this whole endeavour is going to finally end, but that doesn't make the journey pleasing in fact it's very painful to watch.And don't even get me started on the latest twist from the latest episode, after making us set through three seasons the writers want to punish us by telling us that the cause of the series was a false one to begin with! It's almost like they just made that up last minute to get people to watch the following season because they know that everyone is getting bored with this show. I hate how the characters end up getting ADD or going through constant Bipolar sessions. It's almost like no one is ever certain of who they are and yes it is confusing and stolen from a million dozen storylines made before hand!

"Yet another fantasy produced by Jews (Sherri Rufh, Sam Berliner, Barry Levinson, et al) that prominently feature a black expert, in this case, forensics. Since we know that none such existed in the 1800's, the intentional but subtle brainwashing message here is that there would have been if not for the cruel, ignorant bigoted white society that prevented it, for which we should feel guilty and make atonement. Have you figured that out yet? And in productions that are present day, it's the message that blacks are fit to rule over us and we should submit to them (when in reality they serve as fronts for Jewish political power). But please explain why in real life there are virtually no black physicists, black philosphers, black mathematicians, black brain surgeons, black rocket scientists, black engineers...heck, there are hardly any black auto mechanics!

Sometimes its easy to think the networks are 'idiots' cause they cancel shows after 1 season that are really, really good and I love finding 'gems' like that on Amazon for purchase. And sometimes, they cancel a show like this  and I can see why. Its not horrible, its just not that compelling to spend time watching in my view and somebody else might love it!",'China Beach' comes to  Afghanistan,1344470400,"08 9, 2012",2,-1
"I've only enjoyed one episode so half for the second half of season 7. I still find Clara very charming and quite interesting, but sometimes she can be very much window dressing. Kind of just there to look at and admire how charming and pretty she is. I don't feel she's been given enough to do compared to Amy Pond. This is only the beginning of her journey and I look forward to following that journey. I would recommend that people give this half season a try because we all have different taste. I will continue to watch until the season finale, but after that I don't know if I can continue purchasing such low quality episodes.","Average hand-wavium, feelings and love solve every problem averagness",1366761600,"04 24, 2013",2,-1
"Getting into mid flight, then crashing again. That was season 3.So after the fascinatingly terrible second season we kick off the third season with a bang, the doofi haven't come up with a plan or anything but they're wandering aimlessly getting by when they find the prison and plan to make that their home due to it's impenetrable walls. The first half of season 3 is, actually pretty darn enjoyable! Rick's team scrambling to get their s*** together was pretty entertaining while Andrea's encounter with the Governor was pretty interesting. Unlike the second season where the actors sat around a farm and waited for their knuckle dragging fanboys to shower them with money and praise, this season interesting things actually happen and the 7th Heaven conversations are vastly minimized to bare necessity.Rick's group was the most entertaining part of the show. A few major characters are unexpectedly killed off in gruesome ways and after one problem is dealt with another pops up. I guess it's because we're familiar with these people now that they all have a place in the situation instead of sitting around bored. The acting is still hammy and forced, especially by Rick who does the worst American accent I've seen in awhile. Apparently American's grunt all the time. His descent into madness though was nicely done. Carl also steps his game up this season, instead of annoying his parents and me, he has hardened into the situation and his actor doesn't play it cutesy or whatever. Short Round also steps his game up when he sees Rick going crazy, so it was nice seeing some development with these characters, lord knows it was long overdue but at least it's finally here.Then we got the other storyline with the Governor, and it was pretty interesting when you're first introduced to Woodbury. However a few episodes in this supposed badjazz Governor seemed to enjoy nothing more then sitting around drinking with Andrea and discussing their feelings, I wouldn't be too surprised if there's a scene they left on the cutting floor with both of them reading Cosmopolitan too. His arc is slow and boring, which was a bad call considering the producers want him to be a memorable villain. Basically after his eye's taken out he becomes a surly douche who is hellbent on destroying Rick and his gang for flimsy reasons, then the last scene you see him in he finally snaps into what we've been hinted at for an entire season.Andrea is also boring with her token black friend, I got little to no impression that they're friends, instead they seemed more like survivor acquaintances who at the first sign of shelter start snapping and b***hing at each other like rabid hyenas. Her arc was interesting regarding that she's one of the main characters in the comic who's still around. In the show, she goes to Woodbury, sleeps with the governor, wonders if he has some brews loose when she finds his human heads collection, tries to resolve the tensions between groups, then gets killed. Wow. I mean, half the season was dedicated to this sole character who slowly pieces together for 12 episodes ""governor... BAD!"", and then abruptly dies. I mean the surprise was nice but what a waste of time that ends up being watching this expendable character sit around, drink, and wonder if something's wrong.Michonne, like a malignant tumor, grew on me. At first she just glared at everyone everything and clutch onto her unbreakable katana afraid everyone will take it. However once I got endless vapid dialogue with the other characters comparing periods her silence became welcoming to me, and I ended up liking her by the end of the season. Merle also comes back this season, but he basically just plays governor's lackey until he's betrayed, then turns into angsty jerk that no one likes. Like Michonne however, he was pretty straight forward and not too talky which worked fine for me, also Michael Rooker is a great actor so he brought some dimension to Merle's character.So after the midseason finale when the governor's pissed off and Rick's going crazier, the show kind of just stops. They could've excluded the last couple of episodes and still worked. Instead we got many filler episodes, such as Rick running into the black dude from the first episode, and Andrea getting chased by the governor for an entire episode. Why did they even do that? Why did they bloat out a solid first half into more nothing? Why do the Walking Dead writers hold so much contempt for their fans? Why not end this season 12 episodes in or something, keep it lean and solid, or go the extra mile and give the season a clear resolution with the governor rick's conflict, and make season 3 a knock out? Oh yeah, because AMC doesn't care about quality.So season 3 definitely picks up from the soggy turd that was season 2 (really though there was no where to go but up), but flails and crashes after the halfway mark into another bafflingly mishandled season of the walking dead. It looks like the production team blew their entire budget on the first half then slapped a few filler episodes together centered around one character, and called it a day. So instead of this being a solid good season, it's a few good episodes, followed by nothing, followed by a giant middle finger, followed by credits. Really though, they promised for the finale 27 deaths, then it turns out that almost all of them were unimportant stock characters shot off screen. I'll give the writers this, they're intune with their fans pleads for mercy. They hated Lori, she died. They hated Andrea, she died.So all in all it concludes into a mildly diverting tv show, but it's never really scary, exciting, or engaging. The zombie apocalypse is still poorly shown and instead of a grittier more realistic survivalism story we still see characters sit around not doing too much. The gun handling in this is still laughably bad and the pacing gets progressively more sluggish as the season shambles along. Really though I've long given up higher expectations for this show, the fact that thousands of fans showered this season with praise before they even finished it (finale date   3 31 13) shows that TWD fans are, still, gullible morons who see nothing wrong with paying $40 for another half jazzed season.P.S.

The lines predictable and delivered with all the skill of a 4th grade school play cast.There's as much grit and realism as Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood without the catchy title song.

"Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park. To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle, I was beginning to find the show less and less funny. I watched this episode with the hope that it would re ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13. Unfortunately, the episode titled ""Pinewood Derby"" simply didn't allow for that re ignition of my liking and I'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist. This episode focuses around Randy's pjazzion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it's run. In order to win, Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car. They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys. I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character. He's good for a part in an episode, but it's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply doesn't work. The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways. The humour didn't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider, dressed as Princess Leia.",Disappointing,1243900800,"06 2, 2009",2,-1
"Honestly, I should give this movie 3 stars, because it's okay. It isn't bad, but i take a star away for what it isn't. It is a movie about a college professor vampire who thought the love of his life died hundreds of years ago until she walks onto his campus. So this professor, and inexplicably the student, played by the beautiful and the Hollywood underused Julie Gonzalo, get the hots for each other and start having an affair. There is absolutely NOTHING hot about this affair. In fact, through the entire movie, the sex talk is rampant, yet there is nothing remotely HOT about the entire thing.To make matters worse, they also cast the incredibly hot Alexis Knapp (Pitch Perfect, Project X) in the movie and she is barely used as well. So, you have Gonzalo, Knapp, a student having an affair with her professor and a sorority full of girls, constant sex talk, vampires attacking parties, an entire sorority of girls becoming vampires and NONE OF IT is actually shown. None of it. It is the most frustrating movie EVER. It is the blue balls of movies.Vampires. Sorority girls. Sex. Gonzalo. Knapp. Yet, it was filmed in a way that it could safely air on DISNEY CHANNEL; if it weren't for all the sex talk and cussing. Man I really like Julie Gonzalo and I'm really glad that she's getting parts. I just wish that somebody would give her something good. I give this movie 2 stars for the fact that Gonzalo is walking and talking in it, otherwise, it is the most confusing movie ever.

"I detest streaming videos. Where is the DVD set for the 2013 Dallas season 2? I want the hard copy. Not some virtual version controlled by a 3rd Party. Consumers need to stand their ground to ensure we continue to have the option of DVD's for our movies & TV episode seasons.Fortunately, I did tape every episode on VHS as a precaution just in case they pulled a dirty trick like this. Season one was immediately available on DVD at the end of the broadcast season. But season 2 is nowhere to be seen. No evidence they plan to offer DVD's at all for season 2.I don't use DVR's because those are worse. As an example, the network was able to have the cable & sat providers delete a controversial episode of Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory from every DVR it had been recorded on. These deletions surgically occurred across multiple providers who claimed it was a software upgrade glitch which deleted this one particular episode on the same week, about 2 months after it was aired, from the DVR's of every customer which had recorded via DVR.  Fortunately, mine was on VHS where they couldn't get to it. There were hundreds of viewers complaining in the online forums how that episode was deleted on all of their DVR's despite using different providers. You can probably still find these complaints online.This is just one example of the drawbacks of soft copies like streaming video, DVR & instant episodes. Even if the DVR was disconnected, a command can be inserted to delete an episode the next time the unit is accessed.  At any future point, these can be remotely deleted with simple commands. Many years ago, I was on the original design team for these DVR & interactive set top boxes for the cable & sat companies. The capabilities for these devices are far more invasive than anyone can imagine. Why do you think they give away these DVR boxes. I specifically purchased plain set top boxes from direct TV which do not have DVR's. Also, by owning the equipment, they cannot arbitrarily upgrade or change anything.This info will likely mean nothing to you until it is too late; after one of your recorded episodes has been deleted without warning & blamed on some glitch. All it takes is the fear of a lawsuit for a network to order the discreet elimination of some episode without warning.Also, avoid Ultraviolet DVD's which install spyware on your computer & can delete other movies & videos on your computer which is determined not to meet certain standards. You should be able to find comments on this website which pertain to the drawbacks of Ultraviolet.Fighting to insist on DVD versions for movies & TV just may be the last vestige of control remaining between the public & absolute control of providers.

No.  Yuppies and working folk milling about.Police act unrealistically.  Firemen act unrealistically.  They are rushing around to help people, but never help people.  LOL.Another stupid lapse in logic (Possible Minor Spoiler): The main group of people get &#34;trapped&#34; in a parking garage by a flimsy gate that they can LIFT WITH A JACK!  They do so to let two people out.  Then give up on jacks because the first jack loses its grip.  Dozens of jacks in dozens of cars behind them, but . . . no.  Not to mention the fact that there are two ton vehicles they can hotwire and drive THROUGH the gate.  But no.And MOST LAUGHABLE OF ALL, two helicopters crash FOR . . . NO . . . CONCEIVABLE . . . REASON.  Just to press the fact that life is somehow now chaotic.  Like the writers are saying, &#34;Hey, things are getting whacky, guys!  See that?  Stay tuned!  Keep watching while we figure out what the hell we're doing!&#34;So, we just follow a group of people who stick together for no reason, do not try to get to their loved ones, yap and argue and fret, while who knows what is going on.  Very annoying.IF you even make it to the end, something weird happens that promises a new world kind of like the Walking Dead on steroids.

"Patty started hoarding when her philandering husband leaves her.  She has two sons.  The cleaning guy with the chin dimple tried to sleep in her house, but couldn't to it.  It was yucky and funny seeing his head resting close to some fecal matter.  Patty has two sons, one married to a man.  ND doesn't allow same sex marriage, but I'm so happy that the show always refered to Cody as a husband and not some euphemism.  The mother and brother called the husband all kinds of names, but the show doesn't explain why the husband is a bad person.  If anything many rainbow flag men would have left lovers with crazy family members in a second.  Once the house is clean, the therapist encourages the owner to deal with her feelings.  I don't understand how an empty house makes a woman deal with being dissed by her ex spouse.  The (straight) son at times has his T shirt's msg blurred and at other times is seen wearing the Gabriel Iglesias shirt saying ""I'm not fat; I'm fluffy.""  I'm a fatty too and I can empathize with the family, but they did seem morbidly obese.  I do worry about their healths.In the other fact pattern, the woman of the house owes about $50,000 in credit card debt due to hoarded objects.  Her husband had every reason in the world to leave her, but you can tell he doesn't want to in his heart.  The woman had the nerve to say she never wanted sons, although she has 4 of them.  The crew is nice enough to clean her house and she yells, ""I don't like the color of these walls.""  After all her drama, the therapist said, ""She may seem like a jerk to others, but that's the disease controlling her.""  I'm skeptical of that.  It felt like pjazzing the blame.  This woman was just really nasty and when she abandoned by everybody who could have loved her, I think she's going to be quite rueful.  She cries and yells, ""I hate being disappointed.""  I was thinking, ""Then maybe you shouldn't set unrealistic standards for others!""

I still find the cast enjoyable and some of the episodes and action is still decent but the plot and finale for the final season was the most weakest written from the writers of the series and sadly left me with more annoyance on the series ending then any sort of satisfaction.I understand the writers and producers felt the need to wrap up the last season quickly but that has become their fault on making this season the least liked out of the entire series run.So if you already have the previous seasons I say stick with those and just forget the seventh and sadly least entertaining season you won't be missing much.,A Strong Start To A Weak Finish For The Series,1386374400,"12 7, 2013",2,-1

"""Last Night"" stars four gifted players Guillaume Canet, Keira Knightley, Eva Mendes and Sam Worthington. It also has Peter Deming's nice, atmospheric photography and Clint Mansell's mesmerizing score. Largely set in New York, the film has everything that would make a witty and insightful drama about loyalty in marriage, with a realistic look on married life, told in a romantic but not sentimental fashion. Sadly, well acted as it is, the film lacks something emotional that would draw the viewers into the characters' world.""Last Night"" follows the story of married couple Joanna (Keira Knightley) and Michael (Sam Worthington) living in New York. While Michael is in Philadelphia for a business trip, Alex (Guillaume Canet) Joanna's ex boyfriend arrives from Paris to meet her. In the meanwhile, Michael in Philadelphia is alone with his co worker Laura (Eva Mendes), and he is clearly attracted to her.What will they do? The unpredictable story has some touching moments, but after all, it is very hard for us to care about these characters, especially Sam Worthington's Michael. His uninteresting character works against the film's attempt at creating suspenseful romance. Knightley and Canet fare much better, but with barely enough chemistry to make us believe the flimsy back story of the characters they play, their romantic relationship is not very involving.""Last Night"" is a drama that is sometimes pretentious (see the ending) but overall watchable, thanks to the compelling performance from Keira Knightley.",(2.5 STARS) See for Keira Knightley's Nuanced Performance,1337040000,"05 15, 2012",2,-1

"This film is extremely one sided. It promotes the views and opinions of drug dealers, other criminals, and wannabe criminals. It is intentionally misleading, and often what they claim is an outright lie. There is plenty of valid and verifiable evidence that demonstrates exactly how drug use is crippling our society at all levels. Yes, there is some corruption in law enforcement. But the typical law enforcement officer is honest, and earnestly abides by the laws her she is sworn to uphold. People who become cops because they like excitement, or power, or just want to feel like a bad jazz, rarely last long on the job. They are easy to identify and in most cases are quickly weeded out of the force.

"This is a review for Video on Demand. This, in no way, is meant to say that the service is lacking. It is a great one. this is reviewing the movie.In the city, strange things are taking place. At first it seems like nothing more than some shadow play and a bit of urban migration, but that turns to panick as the numbers go up. Overnight, people literally leave their homes and vanish, taking nothing. As the mystery here deepens, so too do the reasons to why this is taking place.When I first saw this advertised in the pages fof Fangoria, I was immediately shopping for a venue to watch it. That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then, perhaps saving some people money. I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route. Still, this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities, with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street. I know   I have been there before and recognized the signs. I watched it with two other people as well, and they concurred. A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why. The main actors hang in there through this, and it all seems good. Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows, some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand, and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress. The writers are at fault in a lot of this, and the direction hurts as well. What you have is an "" o no, avoid that shadow"" story mingling with a really boring output from the actors. Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing, and it gets old fast. Really fast.I wish I could say something better but, in the end, I don't know how. What I do know is that you should not et this and, for 10 bucks, you should heed all the warnings out there.

"This work goes into how a free woman could marry and stay with a husband who has life in prison.  To each their own.  I wish the two of them the best.  However, one thing didn't sit well with me.The wife wants to have a biological child with her husband.  If Florida doesn't allow conjugal visits, then why would they allow semen to travel across the prison walls?  I believe the Supreme Court said marriage is a fundamental right; however, the same is not absolute about procreation.  Let's face it: most children raised in a house with one income with a parent that will never be free will likely face lots of poverty.  Further, sexual violations and drugs are common in prisons.  What if the man goo has a disease in it?  What if a woman like Octomom wants to keep having children with an incarcerated husband.  The money it would take to raise these kids would have to come from our state, aka our tax dollars.  Further, I think criminologists could argue that in the same way that the punishment of prison involves not having contact with the opposite sex; along those lines perhaps prisoners forfeit their ability to reproduce.  There are already far more than 1 million children with incarcerated parents alive; they face circumstances that are not easy.  Further, Mrs. Bailey proves that she has a big heart; a parentless child already alive could greatly benefit from having her as a parent, or foster parent.In short, this woman's wish is just NOT going to happen.  It would set a very dangerous and costly parent.  I identify as a political progressive.  I sympathize with the folk in prison.

"After a company christmas party on a cold winter night (guess a Christmas party in summer would be kinda tacky wouldn't it) we have three friends who decide to stop at an ATM. The simpliest of things often turn into a nightmare (or at least they do in this film) and as all of them go to leave some guy in a big winter coat with a mjazzive hood is standing outside looking at them. Unable to figure out what he wants initially it becomes obvious this guy wants something from them and that seems to be to watch them suffer as he does things to get inside and kill them.Its a simple premise and a bit like Colin Farrell's ""Phone Booth"" in that for most of the film its centralized to just the ATM location with the three panicking friends and the killer on the outside. The cast is also pretty typical as the three friends are played by (Alice Eve ""She's Out of My League"", Brian Geragthy ""Jarhead"" and Josh Peck TV's ""Drake & Josh"") as is the killer who really does nothing more than stand outside looking menacing and well of course kills.There are plenty of problems with this movie, namely one being the viewer constantly thinking ""Just run to the car, you can take him"" especially in the early going when the guy goes around the back of the building. It becomes clear what the motives are behind this game the guy is playing with the three people none of which is terribly shocking I guess. Its hard to do a movie from one location and while I give director David Brooks (in his feature debut) props for trying something different there really isn't enough tension to keep the movie going for a full length running time. *1 2 out of 4 stars.",Too many withdrawals from this 'ATM',1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2,-1

"May be spoilers belowMy mom and I went to see this.  We were thinking it was going to be a normal adult comedy.  Well, we were right and we were wrong.  We actually left after about 50 minutes, but what I saw was so stupid.  The movie had an art house feel.  People get neighbors.  They are a frat.  They ask them to keep it down and things go crazy.  That is the movie, at least from what I saw.There are so many things that happen that just didn't need to.  Like the guy being able to get an erection whenever he chooses.  I mean, really?  It just didn't make me laugh at all.Some of the stuff made me feel uncomfortable.  I know this is a movie, and none of this actually happened.  Still, it made me feel uncomfortable.  Like when the two are having sex and the baby is sitting right there looking at them.  I know what they were trying to do, but it didn't work.  The guy starts smoking a joint and there baby is there.  That didn't work either.  The two worst parts I saw were when the baby put the condom in it's mouth and when the doctor told them the baby had aids.  He was kidding, but I didn't find it funny.I have this pre ordered.  I may cancel that and just rent it when it comes out.  As I said, we saw like 50 minutes.  But, it felt like 15 or 20.  The movie just has the same thing happening over and over again.  It was just a childish movie.  If they didn't have the baby, it could have been better.  It is like they used the kid as a prop.  It was a waste of $16.50.After thinking a bit more about it.I was thinking more about this throughout the day.  Here are my thoughts.This movie has three parts.One is, two people who have a kid and are not yet ready to live the life of two adults.  They want to continue living a life of fun and continue to be carefree.Two, a couple still feel young and want to hang out with people younger with them.  They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.  If any of these parts were taken out, would the movie have been better?The part with them having a kid and not being ready to live like parents. That could be funny.  I think they could have made that a fun movie.  If they took out all the random use of the F word, all the sex and random drug use.  I think it could have been great.If it would have been about two married people trying to live like they did when they were kids or teens.  That could have been funny.  If they did a movie like that and took the child out, it could have been really funny.  With the kid not in all the scenes, they could have swore, drank, did all the drugs and had all the sex they wanted.  I would have laughed a piece of my jazz off.If they did a movie in which a couple tried to get rid of bad neighbors.  That could have been funny as well.  It would all depend on who was trying and whom they were trying to get rid of.  Husband and wife trying to get rid of neighbors would have added a fun element.  The actions and reactions between the two would have made for some good laughs.The problem is that I don't see how these three things can fit into one hour and a half movie.Another thing I realized is that perhaps some of it had to do with the actors.  I am not saying any are bad.  I like all of the actors I saw.  But, seeing Zac Efron as a druggy, partying teen didn't work for me.  I do not believe I have seen him in anything.  But it just didn't feel right.Dave Franco.  He seemed like a good actor.  I do not know what I have seen him in either.  But it just felt like he was wrong for the character.  I cannot explain why.Another reviewer said something.  They said it felt like you were watching clips.  I thought the exact thing as we were leaving the movie.  Nothing seemed to go together.  No story at all, or maybe there was a story, they just did not pull it off.There is a part of me that wants to finish the movie.  I want to see if there is any point to it and what the conclusion is.  That is why I kept my pre order.","One of, if not the only movie with him that I could not stand.",1400198400,"05 16, 2014",1,-1

"If &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; was anything like Alex de la Iglesia's last film &#34;The Last Circus,&#34; then its audience would be in store for surreal visuals, an incredible score, and most importantly two hours of unpredictability. Unfortunately, &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; decides to be much more absurd rather than an intriguing tragedy of horror.The lighting is visually striking as soon as the film begins as Eva (Carolina Bang) rides her motorcycle through a forest during the day. The sun's light leaks through the holes in the branches of trees to create this optically pleasing opening scene. The colors and costumes during the heist sequence are also incredibly vibrant, but it's disappointing that the gore you see here is all you get in the entire film.Jose's ex wife Silvia (Macarena Gomez) overreacts to an extent that is mind boggling and completely frustrating. Not only is she the worst nurse in existence, but she outruns a couple of cops solely because she realizes her son is part of her husband's heist. Hellacious women and complaining about them in length are the bread and butter of the film, which leads one to believe that Mr. Iglesia has likely had it rough with the opposite sex over the years.The horror comedy is somewhat compelling at first with a shootout that sees someone dressed as Spongebob shot until their last breath and a car chase in a taxi culminating with one of its pjazzengers being tied up and thrown in the trunk. Around the time Jose and Antonio start drooling over and competing over Eva's affection is where things go downhill. Witches begin crawling on ceilings, male characters make out with each other, and a giant, blind, obese woman with breasts that sag so low that it's a safety hazard for everyone within a three mile distance stomps into the picture only to begin eating people.&#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; is an overly bizarre film that does fit Alex de la Iglesia's repertoire, but at the same time pushes the boundaries of fun and outrageous which results in a ludicrous atmosphere. &#34;Witching & Bitching&#34; is essentially &#34;The Wicker Man&#34; if Sam Raimi got a hold of the rights and directed it.",A nice steamy pile of outlandishness,1405641600,"07 18, 2014",2,-1

"Odd mixture of Glee and slasher film has a few laughs, some decent gore and a lot of musical numbers.  Stage Fright has a fantastic trailer but the movie itself isn't nearly as good.  The problem is that Stage Fright wants to be a horror comedy but it isn't funny enough consistently to work as a comedy and there are too few suspense scenes for it to work as a horror film  the horror elements are pretty much concentrated at the beginning and end of the film and mostly ignored in the middle.  That leaves the singing and dancing.  The songs aren't bad and a couple of the musical sequences are even fairly clever, but the various elements Stage Fright is trying to juggle never really end up meshing all that well.

"This show used to be about two guys, one a cocky attorney and one a genius pretending to be an attorney, and it was also about the interesting process of trying to survive as a rookie (with secrets) in a highly competitive law firm, a topic which had never really been explored before. And the writers did a good job, for a while. But   and this is what gave it moral weight   it was also about clients. Clients. That's right, real people, non attorneys in danger from the law, who needed very good representation to win them justice.Then, as season 2 ground on, this show became only about the war ing egos WITHIN the law firm, the jostling for power that the writers just make up the rules for as they go along   and it had so many twists and turns that no outcome was ever earned dramatically. It became like watching a bunch of smart alecks exchanging zingers   the equivalent of teenage boys in an alley saying, ""No,YOUR mother eats golf balls."" Or whatever. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) is a very watchable actor, but the writers no longer give his character anything that means more to him than his own vanity. Patrick J. Adams (Mike) is a very limited actor, and he can't convincingly play a hetero guy. He may be one, I don't know or care   but he can't PLAY one. Yet his story arc has degenerated into: ""But Rachel, don't you love me, now that we had completely unconvincing frantic sex in the law library?""We need stories that aren't just about a bunch of overinflated egos vying for dominance in a sterile corporate environment.

"This is a notable episode because it marks the end of four years of pointless digging. In season one, self confessed morphine addict Jack Hoffman started rather aimlessly digging a hole in Alaska. His mining technique was to rather aimlessly dig shallow holes with an excavator and test the results. Based on a tiny bit of gold being found in one hole, he and the TV announcers claimed that they were on the trail of a million dollar pile of gold at the bottom of the hole.It didn't matter that the spot to dig seemed to have been at random. It didn't matter that what they were doing made no particular sense economically or as mining. All that mattered was digging the hole deeper.Four seasons later, the hole was 130 feet or so deep and had yielded a marginal amount of gold. But certainly not enough to pay the expenses of digging it out and running pumps to keep the water out.And finally in this episode, they gave up. The hole would go no deeper.All credit to Dakota Fred Hurt. He managed to get paid for nearly four seasons of television work aimlessly digging a hole. He kind of showed that the way to make money in this ""gold rush"" is to talk big, look busy but do as little work as you can get away with. With enough phony drama, you can get a bigger television audience to watch people dig a hole than you could for all the nature and science programming that used to be on the discovery channel.My hope is that next season they find a new can do guy like maybe ""Nugget Brain"" Wayne to go back to the hole with rock drills and explosives to get down deeper where that million dollars of gold has to be.

Even the ending, I had a sense of the last minutes of the film, in the first 10 minutes.Really interesting idea for a movie, but it was not executed very well. It is a little like SAW films, but less entertaining, and with a plot that is totally transparent.The acting was pretty poor, the characters where never developed, you never even find out the reason each character is there except the main one. It is almost a half finished film in that regard. It is very short, I can not help but wonder if they chopped off an hour or so of the film.While the camera work is not low budget.

A lot of opportunities for any kind of special effects are skipped with the camera cutting away, then the results seen.At the time of me writing this, the movie had 5 stars.

"Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver screen, but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy, that's very hit or miss. In World's Greatest Dad, Williams plays an English Teacher, who covers up his son's bizarre and embarrjazzing death. The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.

"This is one of those movies that just doesn't go and or do anything.  It just lies there, dormant and motionless until the credits roll and your eyes readjust to the light.  What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose, and even the approach (restraint as opposed to abrasiveness) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome.  The base plot feels almost silly, never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed.  The characters are skeletons, the revelations are minute and the overall impact is barely a scratch.  Dafoe sleeps through his performance and builds no depth between his character's motivations and his eventual arc, but at least Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor (she needs more roles) offer up some great supporting performances that actually build a backstory.  At the end of the day, two sharp performances and some beautiful scenery cannot a good film make.  This bore of a tale never fully gets off the ground, despite many attempts to do so.  I understand that this is a more internalized film, but there never seems to be enough reason to care much for what is unfolding.  At the end of the day, it says very little.

"I initially watched this movie because the general storyline seemed to hold some promise. Once started I continued to watch the movie hoping that eventually something would happen that would pull it all together; I was, however, doomed to disappointment as nothing ever came to its rescue. The movie just plods along with darkness threatening and people disappearing with no effort at an explanation or resolution.It has an interesting premise where people disappear and leave clothes, shoes, gljazzes, jewelry and false teeth behind but the implementation of that premise is a sorry disappointment, the devil is in the details. One keeps hoping that some sort of reason will be revealed but that never happens. The problem, whatever it might be, involves not only 7th Street but all of Detroit.As a Christian I see the resemblance to the Christian doctrine of the Rapture of the Church but whereas this doctrine has a cause and an explanation and is fundamentally good; the disappearance of those in the movie is never explained and is represented as fearful, threatening and evil.When the movie stops the story is continuing but the movie isn't; that's sort of a relief really, one has the feeling whew, it's finally over.

"On the front of the box it shows the main character ""Nick"" swinging an axe but it never happens in the show.  There is no axe.  It's just a cheap marketing ploy.I wanted this show to be good but it is not. I saw season one and was bored and hoped it would get better but it never did.  Being a ""Grimm"" means you are related to the faerie tale author from long ago.  The only thing that separates a ""Grimm"" from a normal dude in the show is that they can see a wolf ox fly lamb person and that's it.  Strangely this seems to terrify creatures that can shape shift, heal, jump ten feet in the air and have claws and teeth.  It makes no sense.  It's stupid.It makes no sense that the Grimms have not been all killed off by now.  They have a power that is problematic for beast people but not dangerous.  If you just look at the world like it is Grimms are no big deal but everyone seems to think they are because of the writing that has no basis on logic at all.(spoilers)OK well the whole Juliet amnesia thing gets dragged out more which is really really really boring.  Nick continues to act really wooden,  The partner who is a better actor does not get less air time than last season.  The Asian dude is still the plucky comic relief comic relief which is racist.  All the monsters are white people which is racist and their is a Mexican Banshee which is odd.The monsters are not all were farm animals this season which is better but actually less tied to actual Grimm faerie tales or legends of any kind.  I have no idea why the show is called Grimm.  I imagine there is a copy of Grimm's Faerie Tales in the studio but I'll bet it is dusty.There was a Minotaur (Greek) that turns into an Efreeti (Indian) but is played by an American white dude like 99% of every monster on the show, I mentioned the Mexican (Mexican Spanish) Banshee (Irish), Naga (South Asian) biker dudes played by more American white dudes. Actually all the monsters are basically played by white people from America or Canada which makes no sense what so ever.None of the plot arks ever unfold into anything interesting.

"This movie rates as my all time worst movie ever made.  A third grader can make a more coherent and interesting movie.This movie is supposed to be about the end of the world, at 4:44am covering the last evening and morning.  To sum up the movie there is: overly extended sex scene.  Willem Dafoe is gross.  It's not hot or sexy, but if you want a sex scene, don't drag it out... 30 seconds would have done rather than the 5 plus minutes of amateur shots. painting.  Lady, we get it, you paint.. and your paintings suck. walking.  Lots of walking for no purpose.  In one scene, a stationary camera filmed the actress walking from one end of the apartment to the other... for 30 seconds.  No cuts, just one long shot. lots of tv clips of interviews... this is a good 1 3 of the movie and serves no point what so ever. going out on the balcony and looking meaningfully at the McDonald's across the street. being shocked, absolutely shocked that you watched a person climb over a 4th story railing and jump off the building to their death... and then Dafoe, a few seconds too late yells out like he wanted to help him.  You watched him climb over the railing and said nothing.  Are we supposed to believe you didn't know he was going to jump? Visiting friends who are partying.  One of the won't do drugs because he wants clarity for the end... are we supposed to believe that. THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF ANY DISCERNABLE SCRIPT AT ALL.  Everything was ad libbed with a general idea of what to talk about.. and it shows.  At least reality TV is fun and more scripted than this disaster. Some asian kid delivers chinese take out a mere few hours before the end of the world... why?  Like anybody would actually be working? The movie is one long ad for Skype.I wanted EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER AND PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FILM TO DIE.  Even the ending was messed up as it took about 5 minutes to pjazz 2 minutes of time.... and the end of the world is a fade to white.  You don't even get to see these horrid actors burn which would have been the only redeeming characteristic of this travesty impersonating a film.I am shocked Willem Dafoe is in this.  Him having made this makes him clearly not Willem Dafriend as the movie and his performance clearly show no respect for writers, cinematographers, filmmakers, directors, actors, the audience, the popcorn guy, not even the cockroach that eats your dropped popcorn.

It's interesting to think about life in POMPEII on the fateful day Mount Vesuvius errupted and ended life in the thriving city. The movie POMPEII caught my attention and I was imagining a somewhat historical tale of love and life in the time of disaster.It seemed like the filmmakers took the idea of a volcano errupting and worked a fantastical tale around it that is as ordinary as they come. Gladiator slave falls in love with rich beautiful young lady who is pursued by an evil politician.  There is so much to tell about POMPEII and the lives of ordinary citizens and the frantic desperate moments when they realized they were doomed.Buffed and chisled Kit Harrington loses his family in Britain and ends up in Pompeii as a slave who is fighting gladiators in the arena. He's again Jon Snow from GAME OF THRONES only in a different setting and time period. He does his best and lovely Carrie Ann Moss always is worth watching. Maybe more of their love story in a different setting would have been more exciting.Kiefer Sutherland is the evil Roman Senator and Sutherland plays his character with some sort of stilted Briish accent. Why do characters set in ancient Roman times always speak with British accents?It seems like POMPEII has a sprinkling of the STARZ series SPARTACUS with its gladiator theme. The main action begins in the last part of the film as Mount Vesuvius finally errupts. Here is where the real story should be given more attention as terrified and desperate people are trying to escape while others are resigned to their fates.I watched the bonus feature about the volcano and the filmmakers say they followed the writings of Pliny the Younger who was a witness to the disaster. They said they followed Pliny's description of the erruption and the effects on the Bay of Naples. Imagine people trying to flee by ship on the unforgiving waters.  Here would be a fascinating story and it is addressed to some degree. Some of the visual effects are great. Others look fake.An attempt was made to tell an interesting story in the time of disaster but the whole film falls apart.,WEAK STORYLINE BUT SOME NICE VISUALS,1401148800,"05 27, 2014",2,-1

"This is the end of an amazing team.  A show that started so strong, looses two of it's stellar team in the last season and in this one George leaves rather early.  So to fly the ship we have only Annie played by Lenora Crichlow.  She and the Mitchell replacement guy are the only ones who have a sense of the world it seems.  The new Werewolf guy plays heavy on the pauper to twin the vampire who is a prince.  Personally I wish that they just said something like Daisy had a magic ring that she used to control Mitchell and George and that's how she got Mitchell to kill the people on the buss and for George to bang her.  I never got why George did that.  He was never really a ""tool"".Anyway here we are in the middle of WW ""V"".  For some reason no humans want to become werewolves even though it would improve their odds greatly.  Only some people are aware of the the fact that Vampires have led the war.  Also Nina and George's child is the anti vampire Jesus but no one can find her even though she lives in the middle of England.  I like the new vampire but that's it.  Other new characters aside from the sweet but dumb werewolf include the ghost of an evil young Tim Gunn from ""Project Runway"",  A child rapist Mary Poppins accompanied by the vampire boy from before but they chose to make him dumb now.  There is a retro ghost girl who looks just like Kenley aldo from ""Project Runway""  but unlike Kenley she hates all things retro except her and Annie points this out after this ghost insulted her tea.  Also there is a goth girl who is also dumb (This season love people acting stupid for some reason) who is made into a vampire by a sleazy ugly vampire and the go off to bang somewhere.

"This movie captures a good idea, but does so very poorly.  There are a couple good scenes here but they are largely outweighed by the bad and the very bad.  I give this two disfigured alien thumbs down.This found footage film opens with the following caption: &#34;The following is actual leaked footage from the US Air Force.&#34;  It's cute when obviously untrue stories masquerade as true stories just to add mood or generate buzz.  The Fourth Kind (2009) had people rushing to Google to check stats of people disappearing and FBI investigations in Gnome, Alaska.  They did it well.  Although that was about all they did well.&#34;For centuries, people have been disappearing on and around Brown Mountain, North Carolina.  Locals believe the disappearances are directly linked with sightings of THE BROWN MOUNTAIN LIGHTS.&#34;  News casts, accounts from locals and witnesses, and testimonials from paranormal experts follow.  These segments represent one of few things that were done well in this movie.A family goes on a camping trip in the Brown Mountains.  The parents and kids are somewhat likable, normal people and their trip is filmed by their youngest son.  On their first night, the kids see lights in the sky moving in a way no star possibly could.The acting is far from top notch.  When the father gets them lost and loses his temper his behavior is totally unfounded.  When they run out of gas (which I don't see happening on a family road trip into the mountains) the family tension escalates and the father becomes rage y, again unconvincingly.  Then again, even if they nailed their lines, the writing wasn't great either.  They come by several abandoned minivans and SUVs&#8230;as if some camping family Rapture had taken them all, leaving their cars and camping gear behind like a scene from The Walking Dead but without the walkers or corpses.We come across all the standard alien invasion film tropes.  Birds becomes disoriented and fly into things creating jump scares, obscured film of extra terrestrial figures in the darkness, lights in the sky, satellite interference, alien mind control telepathy attacks a la Independence Day (1996), aliens examining humans, tractor beams, monstrous alien sounds&#8230;you name it, these filmmakers borrowed it.  Almost none of this is executed well.  But there is one really cool, brief scene in the entire movie when a tractor beam gets someone, cracking and contorting their body while being levitated.The aliens follow the most simple of paradigms.  They're tall, lanky, grey skinned, big eyed, four fingered extra terrestrials that sound, at times, like the Predator (1987) mating with a velociraptor while slitting a pig's throat.  Later we hear them communicate with the bubbly blip sounds from Signs (2002).First time director Matty Beckerman does a hardly serviceable job delivering an entertaining movie.  The biggest faults are clearly found in the writing (also done by a first time writer) and acting, especially the loner mountain man the family encounters  worst performance in the movie by far.  There are some pacing issues as well, with some seriously dull lulls between periods of action.  This movie actually goes from okay, to bad as we transition from the first act.  It just seems to get worse and worse and the film wears on.Maybe I'd take a chance at whatever this director does next, but I won't get my hopes up.  At one point in the movie the mother describes Brown Mountain saying &#34;It's like Deliverance, minus the anal rape.&#34;  As far as my enjoyment of this movie goes&#8230;well&#8230; it's like Deliverance, with the anal rape.  There were short segments of this film that were done well, but too much was poorly for me to recommend this to anyone.","This found footage alien/horror movie captures a good idea, but does so very poorly.

"If you want to watch CSI Miami, season 10, I recommend you avoid the DVD version and upgrade to Blu Ray now as the TV studios obviously want.  The picture quality of TV on DVD is on a downward slide for many series.  The TV studios are deliberately shipping DVD discs with inferior video to kill the format and to make Blu Ray look better than it is.  Here, the DVDs are so blurry I can't watch them.  I CAN'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING!  I own most, possibly all seasons of CSI Miami on DVD; the early seasons are fine, 10 is a visual mess.SEA HUNT Season One on DVD 1958 *underwater* has sharper picture quality than CSI MIAMI Season Ten DVDs.  I'm not joking: if you don't believe me, check it for yourself!  CBS wants us on Blu Ray.I have yet up upgrade my viewing to Blu Ray; but there may also be another factor at play.  Remember first generation STAR TREK, where the close up shots of the sexy female guest star would be shot through a lens that made her look sexier by blur?  David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu Ray did a high resolution close up on his face; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years.  I suspect a state of the art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars, knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm; but the studio can't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu Ray discs, so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say, time for a Cljazz Action Suit?@hg47",This review of CSI Miami Season 10 on DVD is a protest,1356739200,"12 29, 2012",1,-1

Well, you can. Its the typical scenerio, bring comedy  'All Stars' together and it SHOULD be awesome hilarious, and it just isn't.

They are all psychos and what not). So gosling takes it upon himself to seek out some revenge.

"Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods. Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman cljazzic ""Deliverance,"" Julian Gilbey's movie ""A Lonely Place to Die"" starts out promisingly, but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us. Unfortunately, ""A Lonely Place to Die"" is not good in most aspects. Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that cannot make a sensible decision even when ""villains"" are not around. Melissa George plays Alison, a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat and mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act, where things get even more ridiculous and confusing. Without spoiling much, all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller, which seems buried somewhere in ""A Lonely Place to Die.""",Deliverance It Is Not,1343692800,"07 31, 2012",2,-1
"The description for the Eclipse is 100% completely *wrong*.  This is NOT a suspense  it's a romance with subtle elements of drama.  We were all fooled into thinking this was some kind of horror story involving a ghost writer being tormented but it's anything but.  We were also fooled into believing there would be serious discussions involving what it feels like to actually witness a ghost for real and how the human mind feels after witnessing such a traumatic event.Instead it's about a ghost writer who meets a woman who shares similar interests in ghostly activity and they gradually fall in love.  Of course there's another guy in the picture, who's apparently a boxer.  Well the two guys hate each other and are secretly jealous over the woman without actually coming out and admitting it.  Instead we discover that the boxer basically believes the ghost writer is a stalker, while the ghost writer believes the boxer is a drunk.There's only two segments that are worth your time.  One takes place about an hour in when the ghost writer opens his bedroom closet and a scary event takes place in the floorboards, and the other is the fist fight between the two men above.  That's it.  The rest of the storytelling is meaningless and painful to watch.It's a shame too  this movie looks like it takes place in either Ireland or the gorgeous countrysides of England which are *perfect* locations for a horror setting.  Instead it doesn't even try for a supernatural setting.  I recommend skipping it completely.",horrendous!,1329955200,"02 23, 2012",1,-1

"""The Sacrament"" is nothing more than a very LAME account of the Jonestown Guyana tragedy which actually took place and where people actually died.  I guess Ti West and Eli Roth were counting on the fact that since the true tragedy had some age on it, they could try and pjazz this garbage as something original.  Trouble is, there was nothing original about this.You have some reporters who decide they are going to do a ""piece"" on this (fictional) city of Eden Parish.  The filmmakers never bother to tell you where this town was located...I guess because their script writers were not that smart to come up with an unoriginal one.  But I digress.  Seems one of the reporters has a sister who has decided to go beyond the pale and has headed wherever it is Eden Parish is located.  Once they arrive, they start their interviews and all seems well.  But then, people start confessing they are being held against their will, the reporters cannot shut their mouths long enough to get out of Dodge, and then all the people of Eden Parish are forced to drink poison  yes, these filmmakers couldn't even come up with something original for this, so they used what Jim Jones doled out in Guyana:  Kool Aid laced with some type of poison.I am not going to address the so called ""acting"" in here because it was non existent.  ""Father"" (a k a Jim Jones) should have been killed during his stint as the clerk in ""No Country for Old Men.""  He just sorta' ""is,"" and that's it.

"I've been waiting a year to see this episode by Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Dana Priest (and Jim Gilmore) about her year long investigation into the new secret government infrastructure with all the gory details.  This revealed very little about that.  Only about 10% of the episode's time was devoted to where these sites are, how they are funded, how they work with local law enforcement, what they are doing, etc..  The vast majority of the time is spent rehashing the events that led up to this situation with all of the bureaucrats and government officers telling us how patriotic they are and why they were justified to take the gloves off and do anything they wanted beating us over the head with their rhetoric.  I suspect that Priest's story was compromised by the governmental players to water down the theme and impact this story deserves.  What a disappointment.

"Joss Whedon is beloved because of Firefly.  I liked Firefly a lot, but after seeing seeing more of Joss Whedon's work, I realize what a terrible writer he is.  Whedon writes all his male characters as sexless, affable dimwits ""smores are full of marshmallowy goodness"" and makes his female characters cliched superheroes.  He goes out of his way to cast men who come off as harmless buffoons or as sexless or mildly effeminate (the doctor from Firefly).  That way the ""women"" don't get any focus taken off of them.  I put quotes around 'women' because his female characters are usually one dimensional, unlike someone like Starbuck from Battlestar Galactica who actually has some complexity and shows a wide range of emotion.  Add to that the stock sci fi plots and the ridiculously young and attractive actors and you have a female friendly version of JJ Abrams.Agents of SHIELD is the worst thing Whedon has done.  Alluding to my header, in the last episode I saw, the 40 plus year old leader of Shield, Coulson says something like, ""I'm about to have a spaz attack.""  Coulson is the same affable oaf we are used to seeing with Whedon.  The worst written man on Game of Thrones is better than the best male character Whedon ever wrote.All the obsession about levels and getting into SHIELD reminds me of the dorkyness of Star Trek.  There's a scene where 20 FBI agents surrounded the unarmed black ops SHIELD guy who, of course escaped unscathed.  That's because he's level 8 which means a +10 dexterity and 50 percent chance for a critical miss.  At level 9 he could have done the same thing blindfolded.I saw three episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, shocked that actual adults love it to this day.  It's so poorly written, acted, the stunt doubles are so noticeable, and the vampires look like they're wearing Halloween masks.  It's cosmically bad.  Did I say 'bad'?  I meant 'postmodern.'  Why do so many experts say how brilliant this guy is?I wrote this review after seeing an interview with Joss Whedon.  People's reverence for this gentle tool, who is probably only capable of one or two serious erections a month, really annoys me.  I hate it when people don't recognize when something is banal (Once Upon a Time) because I'm sick of only having three shows to watch:  Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, and Orphan Black.edit:  The last episode I watched involved the black ops guy having to survive alone in the woods with a dog.  I am aware of Nazi SS training techniques, so I knew what was coming.  I fast forwarded through the episode, and sure enough I was right.  If you are gonna make a cheesy and cornball series, you shouldn't have such dark and unpleasant moments that don't fit with the mood of the series.

This was bad.. terribly bad. It is the kind of movie where people literally walked away from in the theater.>>> SPOILERS &lt;&lt;&lt;This film does not deserve a well thought out review but I will try and give a few examples of why I think of this movie so awful.Like the other reviewers already mentioned, this is a found footage film. However, the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole. Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm. The film starts with a random (and way to long) low quality introduction of the setting, followed by a first victim of the parasite, and it goes down from there. There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look. There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people, one goes into the house with his gun drawn, the other stays in the car with his seat belt on. There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks (viral, bacterial.. whatever) and does not seem to give a darn when they hear about the mysterious issue's in the town. There is a supposedly intelligent couple (dentist & lawyer) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny!? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crapThen there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out. The science is made up by a 5 year old. All conclusions that are drawn, numbers that are given, idea's that are thought of.. it is terribly. Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical. i.e. the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.The overall story is also weak. I mean, maybe there could be made a half decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites, it sounds pretty cool right?.. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train wreck that is called ""The Bay""A part of me died while watching this film, I will never get it back, I'm scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better..

"There have been so many dark, dirty post apocalyptic thrillers lately it's become hard to tell them all apart. Cue dusty, sun scorched locale, abandoned cars by the side of the road, guys in shaggy beards and dirty tank tops. And violence. Lots of bloody, ugly violence almost too brutal to fathom. Clich&eacute;s are a fact of life in Hollywood but one would expect David Michod, the director the supremely confident Aussie gangster flick Animal Kingdom, to provide a little something off the beaten path for his follow up, The Rover. And while he pulls one haunting performance from a familiar face and a solid turn from an unexpected one, the film offers little to separate it from the likes of Mad Max, The Road, or numerous others mining the same ground.Movies set in a future resembling a burned out husk have long been the bastion of indie filmmakers looking to skirt around budgetary issues, and if &#34;burned out husk&#34; is what one is looking for then the south Australian outback requires the minimum of alteration. In short, it's a desolate place, perfect for a story of men frayed at the edges, ruined by a society that crumbled a decade prior. There are still laws, albeit nobody to really enforce them. Money is practically worthless, food at a premium and petrol even more so. Mercenaries stalk the streets, crucified men litter the highways, and basically every encounter could be your last. Familiar or not, Michod paints a terrifying picture of a hopeless world.Guy Pearce, hiding behind a thick beard and far away eyes, is Eric, a man without a past, certainly without much of a future, and only one possession and that's his car. After stopping by a nearby &#34;bar&#34; for a drink, his car is stolen by three shady types (one is played by Scoot McNairy) clearly on the getaway from something. Eric stalks them down in another vehicle, only to have them get the upper hand and flee, once again in his car. The rest of the film is about this mysterious man's tunnel vision in getting the car back and gaining some measure of revenge on those who took it.First he encounters the simple minded Rey (Pattinson), who was shot and left for dead by his brother, one of the guys Eric is seeking out. The film relies heavily on the bonding between these two, which has moments of gallows enlightenment as they kill their way to where Eric's car is stashed. &#8220;You should never stop thinking about a life you&#8217;ve taken. That&#8217;s the price you pay for taking it&#34;, Eric says during one of their many roadside conversations. Eric doesn't speak much, hardly at all really, but when he does it's to say things like this. And they would have considerably more meaning if Michod, who co wrote the script with Joel Edgerton, had a clearer definition for the character. Bodies pile up, mostly for no good reason and largely at Eric's hand, and he doesn't seem the least bit concerned about them. In one memorable moment, he buys a pistol from a little person only to shoot him with it immediately after, basically out of annoyance. At some point the bleak locale has become an excuse to portray excessive levels of violence without having to be concerned about why there is so much bloodshed. Michod offers no real reason for anything, and it's too much to say the film is about nothingness. That's not true. The utterly pretentious &#34;twist&#34; ending tells us Michod wants it to be about something, he just never gets around to letting us in on what it is. A small hint of sentimentality emerges through the harshness and it feels utterly misplaced and unearned. Like Animal Kingdom, Michod specializes in establishing mood, especially the desolation that follows bad people who live a life of doing terrible things.Pearce should be getting more leading roles but he seems to favor show stopping supporting turns at this point. In a rare starring turn he's especially gruff and haunted. It's not a part that requires much from him yet he delivers what's expected and more. The more interesting performance is by Pattinson who has basically jettisoned Hollywood limelight behind to flex his dramatic muscles with indie directors. So far it hasn't really worked out, and it doesn't really work out here either. With his teeth a mangled mess and his nerves all jittery, Pattinson's portrayal of Rey is too practiced, too aware. What's impressive is Pattinson's dedication to the role and willingness to branch out into something like this in the first place.Animal Kingdom was a confident debut that promised Michod as a bright new filmmaking voice. Too much of that voice has been silenced with The Rover but he should have no problem regaining it next time.",Post-Apocalyptic Sameness,1403222400,"06 20, 2014",2,-1

"I first heard about ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW in a short article in ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY in the fall of 2013. After reading the article, it made me really eager to see the film: a movie that was secretly filmed at Disney&#8217;s amusement parks without their permission?! The movie is now available on DVD and recently I was able to finally watch it.Although it was secretly filmed at both Disney World and Disneyland, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is set at Disney World. The film centers around the character of Jim (Roy Abramsohm). Jim White and his family are on their last day of vacation at the &#8220;most magical place on Earth.&#8221; His wife and kids are getting dressed and ready for the day when Jim receives a telephone call from his boss informing him that he is fired. Jim is upset by the news, but decides not to tell his wife or kids anything because he doesn&#8217;t want to spoil their trip. While on the patio talking to his boss, Jim notices a strange white van below that is seen later on again in the movie. While on the patio, Jim&#8217;s son, Elliot (Jack Dalton) locks him out of the hotel room. These minor events foreshadow terrible things to happen later in the movie and it quickly becomes apparent that although they might appear like a typical American family, there are some serious issues with Jim&#8217;s family. Jim&#8217;s wife is domineering and berates her husband as though he is a tv sitcom dad. Jim, on the other hand, is clearly looking for some excitement in his life and his wandering eye catches the figure of two barely teenage French girls. At least one of them seem infatuated by his gazes and Jim ends up following them throughout the park. As the movie progresses, it becomes more and more difficult to figure out exactly what is going on. The viewer isn&#8217;t sure if the things Jim sees are real or part of his imagination. They don&#8217;t know if Jim is on some kind of drugs, is just imagining, or is being mentally affected by a disease in his brain. The Small World creatures turn into horrific little imps with teeth, a person is beheaded, there&#8217;s a terrible terminal disease called Cat Flu that&#8217;s going around the park, and Jim is seduced (and maybe drugged) by a former Disney character princess. All the while the French girls come and go in so many places that it can&#8217;t possibly be coincidence. Viewers also discover that the Disney character princess are actually high cljazz hookers for Asian businessmen, that food that&#8217;s sold as turkey legs are actually emu legs, and that Epcot and the rest of the Disney parks are just one mjazzive experiment in human social engineering.In terms of film making and cinematic achievement, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is notable for the guerilla way that the movie was made. Although the movie is set at Disney parks, Disney had no jazzociation with the movie, The cast and crew dressed in tourist clothes, the cast&#8217;s scripts were available only through their smart phones, and sometimes the cast went through the same ride almost thirty times in one day. The director became so paranoid that the movie might be discovered by Disney before it was finished that he went to South Korea to edit it so there would be no leaks. It is a testament to the director&#8217;s skill and pjazzion that the movie even exists.With that said, ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW is a terrible movie. The movie is marketed as a horror movie, but the only real horror of the film is its absurdity and nonsensicality. Jim spends the majority of his time in the film chasing around two barely teenage French girls with the determination of a creeper out of a snuff film. There&#8217;s no explanation of who these girls are, what their purpose is, and why they are featured so much. The acting isn&#8217;t terrible, but (other than Jim&#8217;s daughter) there isn&#8217;t a character in the movie that is likeable. For instance, Jim is the central figure of the film but he&#8217;s not really a very likeable person: he stalks the French girls through the park like a crazy creeper, he yells at another creepy man on a scooter for no real apparent reason, he commits adultery while his daughter sleeps in the next room, and he never once compliments his wife. There is definitely some marital conflict between Jim and his wife, but the movie never addresses it and instead, like the news of his firing, it&#8217;s just not mentioned. Jim is kidnapped by a robot scientist, but it&#8217;s never made clear exactly what Jim was supposed to have done or what his part in this grand experiment was. There&#8217;s been some comparisons of ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW to David Lynch movies. There is a similar vibe there, but as weird as his projects often are, most Lynch movies at least have a discernible narrative that can be followed. There really is no narrative in ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW. After I finished watching the movie, I thought to myself, &#8220;What a waste.&#8221;ESCAPE FROM TOMORROW will always be remembered as a side note (the movie made at Disney that Disney didn&#8217;t know about) instead of the actual movie itself. As a movie, it&#8217;s an absurdist nightmare that lacks any real meaning and coherence.",A Movie Nightmare,1400198400,"05 16, 2014",2,-1

"I'd like to say that this TV series had something going for it other than Mireille Enos' winning smile, a nice sound track, and some pretty good photography. But those three qualities could not compensate for the astonishingly bad script, the relentless over acting, and producers who had no idea where they were. This was Seattle, for godssake   not LA, not Chicago, not Philly   SEATTLE.The plot was stolen from Twin Peaks. There is a murder, and in the course of solving it the sordid underbelly of the entire town   its intrigues, its nasty secrets, its dirty laundry   is revealed. But unlike Twin Peaks, which had a sense of humor, The Killing takes itself seriously ... which was a mistake. (I confess I did laugh at times, but it wasn't a jolly laugh.) You just can't have that much stupidity on screen without making your story ludicrous.And, boy, was this show ludicrous. Here are some highlights: cops run a plate but don't know that the vehicle has been reported stolen, to interview a bus driver, cops have to get on a bus and ride around on it all day (Hello?

"It wasn't all that long ago or at least it feels that way, that Hollywood suddenly remembered the sword and sandal films of the sixties and began making them all over again. There were some great films made too, in particular GLADIATOR and TROY. Then the genre died out again or found itself taken over by ridiculously low budgeted reproductions of those popular films. It went back to the shelf. Now director Paul W.S. Anderson tries to bring it to life again with POMPEII. Unfortunately the film falls somewhere between those two types of films, the good and the bad.The story revolves around Milo who as a child watches as his parents and entire tribe of Celt horsemen are slaughtered by the Romans led by General Corvus (Keifer Sutherland) and his right hand man Proculus. Pretending to be dead, young Milo climbs from under the bodies of those who were slaughtered only to later be captured and placed into slavery.Years go by and Milo (Kit Harington) grows to be a fighter in ancient Britannia. When he catches the eye of one of the promoters for gladiatorial fights in Pompeii, he is taken back to that ancient city. Along the way he encounters Cjazzia (Emily Browning) when one of the horses pulling her carriage falls. He catches her eye not just because of his looks but because he puts down the horse in the most humane way possible.Cjazzia gets to Pompeii before the slaves on their way. It turns out that her father Severus (Jared Harris) is the ruler of the city. Severus is trying to promote the city into a minor version of Rome and is aided in doing so by his wife Aurelia (Carrie Anne Moss). While pleased to see their daughter home once more they have yet to find out why she came back from Rome. That is explained later when now Senator Corvus arrives to negotiate with Servus for jazzistance to rebuild the city. Of course, he uses his desire to marry Cjazzia to eventually seal the deal.Meanwhile Milo finds himself in the slave quarters of the gladiators and a target of another slave whose brother he killed. While he survives that the odds of his surviving the arena are slim, even more so when the plan is to have him face off against his cell mate Atticus (Adewale Akinnuoye Agbaje), a slave who is about to win his freedom if he defeats his 19th opponent. The pair square off during practice when an attempt is made once more on Milo only to be stopped by Atticus. While each knows they will one day face off against one another in the arena, a bond develops between the two.In the background of these stories is the mountain that rises above Pompeii that seems to be developing into eruption mode. Since we know the story of Pompeii there is little suspense formed by this except wondering just when it will finally blow.A change in plans in the arena has Milo and Atticus united to face off against the Romans. It's at this time that Corvus makes known his intentions for Cjazzia to her parents. It also happens to be when things begin to happen with the mountain filling the next 30 40 minutes with tons of special effects and carnage. Even with all of that happening a final face off between good guys and bad must take place.Shot using tons of green screen the movie does a good job of making you believe you're looking at an ancient city, but then again used as much as it is your belief starts to dwindle after a while. The explosive effects of the last portion of the movie are well made but at the same time stretch your ability to suspend belief as the main characters all just fall short of being engulfed in flames, fireballs, earthquakes or floods.The acting has no standouts here and is fair for the most part. Surprisingly the one performance that disappointed me the most was from Sutherland whose English accent in a movie set in ancient Rome falls flat. Browning's performance as Cjazzia lacks the depth and believability to carry off the story. Part of that is due to the love at first sight story telling that has her fall for Milo without any hesitation whatsoever.On the whole POMPEII isn't a terrible movie but it isn't a really good one either. It's one of those movies you probably won't be too disappointed in seeing if you like the genre, but not one that you'll want to revisit again after watching. As I watched the movie I kept thinking back to how great movies like SPARTACUS and GLADIATOR really were. When you think of another movie you want to see again while watching the one in front of you, it's not a sign of how good that movie is.",SO SO SWORD & SANDAL,1400630400,"05 21, 2014",2,-1

"Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Hollow"" takes a rather slight story and serves up exactly what you might expect. It seems like many absolutely loathed ""Hollow,"" but I think some of those people were expecting a full on horror show. There is some creepiness, but this presentation doesn't show you much of anything that will actually scare you. It tries to get you to jump at jarring noises, that's the extent of its thrills. Neither particularly good or bad, this is a film with limited ambition or originality. I watched this with a friend, and when the movie ended  he turned to me and said ""well, that was just what I thought it would be."" It's not that either of us hated the film  far from it  we simply thought it lacked any real element of surprise. It's reasonably well made and the actors are appealing enough. It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint. You've seen it all before and oftentimes better.Four friends venture to the countryside to a family estate for a weekend. Set in Suffolk, England, the house borders a creepy monastery with a history of driving local youths to suicide. The friends, comprised of two couples, make the best of things with no electricity and increasingly mysterious goings on. As usual, it doesn't occur to anyone to leave until things have progressed too far. As an extra annoyance, they decide to film absolutely everything. Yes, this is one of those movies! Someone is always holding a camera! Tension, and even madness, starts to infiltrate the group. Can they work against a curse? Can they survive a murderer? Can they stay united? Just what is out there in the hollow? And for goodness sake, that's the best darn camera battery I've ever seen! If you want complex mythology to explain the nightmare, it's never really developed in any depth.For all that, though, ""Hollow"" is surprisingly well acted. What the screenplay lacks in horror, it makes up with some actual character development. The primary quartet are all quite believable. Emily Plumtree, Sam Stockman, Matt Stokoe, and Jessica Ellerby play the four leads. As the stress of the weekend starts to divide them, each turns in a performance that was more convincing that I had anticipated. Seriously, I think they all have the potential to go on to bigger projects. As much as I want to recommend ""Hollow"" for this reason, though, I'm still unable. The back story is both derivative and only vaguely explored. And in a movie that is trying to ratchet up the tension, this is a fatal mistake. I'd personally be happy if I never saw another ""found footage"" thriller. Too often, the genre lends itself to sloppy storytelling. Performances at 4 stars, plot at 2 stars, scares at 1 1 2 stars. The DVD Blu ray packaging might convince you that this is a horror story, but it's really a piece about relationships under duress.

"The first two seasons were brilliant and I had high hopes for this season. Unfortunately, the acting is uneven   whoever plays 'Bullet' is so bad that any scene with her is hard to watch. Too bad she is in so many scenes. If you want to do the show a big service, kill her character off quickly, like next week. She just cannot act. Never have someone who doesn't smoke pretend to unless they can do it convincingly, which is hard and which this actor cannot. This is just a small complaint, the actor really has little skill overall.

"Trite. Unfunny. Predictable. Unintelligent. Partisan.This is a show that had a lot of promise. You begin with Bill Murray in the opening sequence. You have John Goodman. Some other decent actors. The premise is comical right off the bat   a handful of politicians sharing a house in Washington.But the writing is so awful, I can't imagine watching another moment of this program. Maybe I'm jaded, as someone who works in politics, but the scenarios and dialogue just weren't believable (think ""All the President's Men"" or ""The Ides of March"" or even the original ""The Manchurian Candidate""), nor were they quite farcical enough to be recognizable as some sort of absurdist lampoon (think ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" or even ""Thank You For Smoking""). This show is an attempted political comedy that takes itself and its ideological partisan mission way too seriously. Political humor can be great, but, whether it's on the right or left, it usually falls flat when it's a vehicle for driving an underlying partisan agenda first and foremost. Good political comedy should be equal opportunity offensive to both sides, or rather, to the system itself.SNL's Weekend Update, The Daily Show, and its successors are at their funniest and most relevant when they first lay bare the truth about the butt of their joke fairly and in context, giving the subject of ridicule a chance to legitimately make his or her case, and THEN and only then mock the stupidity bigotry misguidedness relentlessly. Alpha House doesn't give Republican viewpoints a fair hearing, nor does it add anything new to the world of political satire parody. It just rehashes a bunch of junk that wasn't funny the first hundred times it was done, and more importantly, it's a chance to score partisan points primarily, and a vehicle for comedy only secondarily.That's what this felt like, at least, watching the pilot. A vehicle for Garry Trudeau's hyper cynical, humorless, out of touch, leftist political agenda.Step one  Start by creating one dimensional characters from the lamest and most overdone Republican stereotypes imaginable.Step two  Throw in some of the left's contemporary pet political issues. Social issues and global warming.Step three  Create weak ""straw man"" arguments from the Republican characters to discredit the conservative side of these issues.Step four  Now try to make that mess funny.Get Garry Trudeau out of this project, and with the cast and concept, it's probably a big hit. The next House of Cards, perhaps. Right now, though, no way does this catch on. Nor should it.

"It isn't required viewing to see Julie Delpy's 2007 film ""2 Days in Paris"" before diving into 2012's ""2 Days in New York"" to fully grasp or understand what occurs in the romantic comedy sequel, but it would more than likely help you appreciate ""2 Days in New York"" a bit more. However, ""2 Days in New York"" doesn't leave you with this overwhelming sensation to view or revisit its predecessor either. The film leaves you feeling like secluding yourself from your family and any sort of responsibility would be the absolute best thing for you when things get really hectic.This movie makes it seem like living in New York leaves you with no time to do anything ever. Maybe all of this was supposed to be funny; family members who don't know English getting away with things no normal person can just because they're from another country and being too busy to be intimate with the one you love despite talking about it all the time. It just felt sad and kind of pathetic. There's a huge emphasis on language barriers, ignorant racial jokes that are pretty preposterous, and how a simple thing like buying drugs in front of a child can really impact them. Most of the humor seems like it's stripped away for a last ditch effort just to stay on top of an already sinking ship. It's emotionally exhausting more than anything.Chris Rock is surprisingly the best part here. He really breaks away from whatever comedy he has jazzociated himself with in the past and brings logic and reason to an already well developed character. The highlight of the movie is his scenes where he has full blown conversations with a cardboard cut out of Barack Obama. The whole brain tumor thing and what it leads to is amusing as well as is when Marion takes Rose to her yoga cljazz. One of Marion's art pieces is a contract for the selling of her soul, which results in this quest for Marion where she's just searching to find herself again. It's very reminiscent of when Bart sells his soul on ""The Simpsons.""""2 Days in New York"" just leaves you feeling drained. Its conclusion feels extremely clich&eacute;, as well. Not only could the movie have ended nearly 45 minutes beforehand, but it's something so simple that always seems to happen in movies containing this plot device. It's like shaking a Magic 8 Ball and getting an ""Ask again later"" type of response. Having too much on your plate and its inevitable consequences outweigh the laughs here.

"A kung fu kicking, chainsaw wielding, blood splattered bride screaming ""it's my day"" is my kind of bloody good fun. So, then why is it that the new entry in Spanish director Paco Plaza's soon to be never ending franchise fails to move me. I suppose to be honest and up front I never did really think all that much of his previous (REC) movies, nor the dull nearly shot for shot Quarantine American versions. The films have all been too deadly serious and derived of the kind of fun that makes a good scary movie. And yet, the lighter, sillier, and even reasonably more engaging (REC)3: Genesis still didn't move me.Starting off as a found footage document of the wedding of Koldo (Diego Martin) and Clara (Letica Dolero), for the first fifteen minutes we attend the various wedding day gatherings, toasts, drunk uncles, etc., until we are ready to check that we are in deed at the correct movie and not some projectionist's lame practical joke. Finally, the drunk uncle turns out to be a zombie and through the usual bite unleashes a zombie plague. The title card arrives informing us that we are in deed in the correct theater, after all,  providing that you are still awake.For the next hour the picture moves at a breakneck pace as Clara and Koldo are forced to dawn chainsaws and medieval knight's attire, don't ask, to face down their undead relatives. At a running time of just eighty minutes, once things get rolling they do indeed, thankfully, not let up.(REC)3: Genesis takes a lighter tone that it's grim predecessors, it's full of slapstick humor and strange quirky bits, like the children's entertainer dressed as a SpongeBob knock off, spongeJohn, of course. Think a wedding and four hundred funerals. The problem is, none of it is really all that funny, the humor draws the viewer out of the narrative, often it is badly forced, occasional just plain bizarre, and very rarely hits the mark.Of late the horror genre, so beloved by me and many others, has become tiresome and stale, it`s stuck in a rut that is worst than any I have ever seen. The very fact that the (REC) movies, and possibly even the Quarantine films, are seen at the forefront of the current movement illustrates the distressing point.The stars here are appealing, mostly Spanish actors that I am not familiar with, but a good talented lot. Dolero is very good in the lead role, she's beautiful and forceful, which helps the proceedings move at a more agreeable rapidity. Enhanced by thralling camera work from Pablo Rosso, who helmed the other (REC) flicks. The screenplay, credited to Plaza and Luiso Beredjo, from what I hope was meant to be an ironic credit for original idea by Plaza, Beredjo and David Gallart, is just plain awful, derivative of not only their earlier films, but countless others, it is also chocked full of hideously stupid dialogue, then again that could just be in the subtitling. Still, Clara nd Koldo refer to one another by ""my love"" so many times in the movie's short running time that a drinking game could be suicidal. The show all comes to the same kind of close that we have learned to expect from it's predecessors.(REC)3: Genesis unfortunately adds nothing new what so ever to the genre, for sure some are going to draw comparisons with the much better Shaun of the Dead, but I think that the inspiration lies in a slightly more obscure film from the early 1990's. My feeling is that it desperately wants to be a close cousin to Peter Jackson's truly magnificent New Zealand zom com Dead Alive, but Plaza's movie winds up being merely brain dead.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",bloody disgusting,1362441600,"03 5, 2013",2,-1

"Despite how many people dislike her, I actually like Mindy Kaling. She has a quirky enough charm to her, where she's worth watching. And unlike her Office character of Kelly Kapoor, in real life, she's actually pretty smart, despite her ditzy voice. So, all of her more real life magic and charm was expected for her breakout series, ""The Mindy Project"" (which came about from ""Untitled Mindy Kaling Project"", meaning this show really doesn't even have a real name, to it).And while Mindy's chick flick charm, mixed in with small flashes of intelligence or competence does work here, she simply isn't enough to hold an entire show. While her best friend and Office co star, BJ Novak is also working on this show with her, and she has some backup in the form of NBC buddy cameos, like Seth Meyers and Ed Helms, the fact of the matter is, none of the rest of the show is good: Her believability as a doctor (unless you were to get racist and jazzume it's because she's Indian), her insufferable and BORING supporting cast, and her premise of being an adorkable girl starring in her own self imposed ""life as a romantic comedy.""The show is supposed to be a companion show to ""New Girl,"" but at least 'New Girl' has it's niche: It's a girly comedy with enough manpower and masculinity in the form of her support cast roommates that it balances itself out for all audiences between 16 and 30. However, ""The Mindy Project"" doesn't have any of this, and it's only real audience seems to be girls ditzy enough to be into Kate Hudson movies, like Mindy Kaling her character, herself. There is no real audience appeal, because not all women in their late 20's early 30's are like Mindy, and honestly, there's no real reason for men to watch, at all. The show isn't funny enough to break any demographic barriers, either. It's mostly not funny, at all. Add in NO likable or interesting support characters, and a boring career premise with Mindy as a 'stupid, yet smart' doctor, and it's just overall lame. Even at it's BEST, it's a mediocre comedy.Mindy Kaling herself has the energy, charm, and pep to at least hold the show on her shoulders for maybe a full season, if that long, but none of the other elements of the show are really worth it.

"Note: I saw the pilot episode of the show via XFinity On Demand.Having seen the 1931, 1958, 1979, and 1992 versions of Dracula by Bram Stoker (and not in that specific order), I decided to give the pilot of this series a bite. The trailers looked enticing, and Jonathan Rhys Myers does a very convincing American accent.Instead of being satisfied with the blood, I was confused, and felt like Lestat when he drinks the blood of two dead boys in Interview With The Vampire. The plot bears hardly any resemblance to the novel, and it's more like a sexed up, stripped down version of the novel. And while the 1931, 1979 & 1958 versions aren't exactly close to the book either, they're at least more watchable than this tired mess of rotting flesh. The definitive Dracula film, in my opinion, is Bram Stoker's Dracula, directed by Francis Ford Coppola (the Godfather trilogy) and starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Academy Award winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost, Monica Belluci, Richard E. Grant, Bill Campbell and Tom Waits as Renfield.Skip this pile of ash.","I Bit Into It, And Spit It Out. Gorge Yourself On Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) Instead.

"A small fraction into this film, the heroine was numb and so was I.  After a race baiting if not racist in context threesome, the lovingly rendered scenes of bloody S&M;, and escalating, I was expecting a beheading by the end of it all.  It was worse.  The two final confrontations were what led me to believe the film was against all that is good, or maybe just against all that is.  The film delighted in erasing any positive sentiment it had accidentally cultivated   or maybe it cultivated positive sentiments for the sole purpose of annihilating them.So our heroine  or hero, since she calls her Joe and not Jo   is against love (stated in Volume I) and against the sentimentality of motherhood (stated in Volume II).  I champion neither, but if the alternative is this ceaseless funfest, then love and motherhood start to look positively enlightened.  I mean, come on, we all had the young adult `this can't be it' moment, so when Joe deadpans: ""Perhaps the only difference between me and other people is that I've always demanded more from the sunset. More spectacular colours when the sun hit the horizon. That's perhaps my only sin."" we can indulge her, until we realise she is completely serious, and humourless in general.Volume I gave us the fishing, maths and music analogies.  Volume II has nowhere to go but religion, so we have Western (Roman Catholic) vs. Eastern (Orthodox) Churches and The Transfiguration.  By this time, the analogies seem more compulsive and excessive than our nymphomaniac.Then Seligman says something to the effect `Being anti Zionist is not the same as being anti Semitic,' a completely unnecessary thing to say.  And then Joe with her `negro' comment.  That was part of what made me think the threesome was... racial.  She says all women fancy it, setting up black male sexuality, and then the outcome of the threesome, while not explicitly emasculating, was cutting.  The scene itself is somewhat hilarious outside race, but in the context of her comments and the fact that the noted appearance of black people in the film is end capped with buffoonery and bookmarked with a racial and sexual stereotype is suspect.  I'm not saying you cannot have divisive characters in film.  But perhaps Seligman and Joe exist to spout the same viewpoint: they simply divided the dialogue.  Seligman got the analytical persona and Joe got the compulsive persona, but, in the end, over analysis and compulsion are both ways to somewhat pompously distance yourself from other people and from life itself.",Against all that is good,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2,-1

"Area 407 is a found footage horror film. A plane crashes in a mysterious area; the survivors are then stalked and attacked by a mysterious predator. The whole situation is documented by two sisters and a fellow journalists (two cameras). I enjoyed the intro and felt it was done well. We meet the characters through some decent dialogue and witness a frightening plane crash (at least for those of us scared to fly). Sadly, the movie goes downhill from here. It uses some very generic found footage scenes like the shouting exchange found in most: ""Please stop recording! Now is not the time! STOP!"" (then hit the camera and cut out, recording restarts in a new scene). Also, I felt a lot of it was illogical, more than your average horror film. They take an hour to get the first aid kit after the crash, the U.S. Air Marshall doesn't identify herself for hours after the crash, and the flight attendant and the Air Marshall don't really know what they're doing (aren't there emergency procedures for this instead of sitting around?) For a horror movie, I wasn't really scared, maybe once or twice. It had some tense moments, though. Acting ranged from good to bad. The ending was also decent, but not enough to complete redeem the film completely. It's a time killer, though.Overall, it's not the worst found footage film, but it's far from the best. If you're still interested, this film is available on Netflix Streaming as of 9 2 12, I can't recommend paying directly for this film.Area 407 has strong violence and blood (most of the violence is off screen), no sex or nudity.","Not the worst of the bunch, but could've been better...",1346544000,"09 2, 2012",2,-1

I don't agree with other who thought it was better than Planet Terror. That movie just seemed to have this cljazzic grindhouse feel to it, while this one just felt cheap and totally silly.

"ATM (David Brooks, 2012)ATM, the first feature from director David Brooks, is a run of the mill thriller. Really, that's it's major problem, and the reason it seems to have attracted so much vitriol. Sure, people are complaining about the script's plot holes, but come on, The Island made, what, eight hundred billion dollars or something? And it had plot holes large enough to swallow this entire script. And, yeah, the characters make some stupid moves, but again, this is a horror film. Horror films without characters who make stupid moves? They're not horror films, they're something else. (I'm not sure what, because in forty years of watching them, I can't recall ever seeing one.) All the other complaints I've seen about the film are strengths, not weaknesses. But I'm getting ahead of myself (and would have to dive deep into spoiler territory anyway, so I'll probably conveniently ignore them).Plot: three co workers, David (The Hurt Locker's Brian Geraghty), his best friend Corey (Josh Peck, the longtime voice of Eddie from the Ice Age animated franchise), and possible future love interest Emily (The Raven's Alice Eve), are headed home late from their company Christmas party. (Goof note: early in the film, Corey refers to the fact that it's three days before Christmas. Every time you see the security camera footage from the ATM, the footage is dated December 17th. Is Christmas on a different day in Manitoba?) Corey is both hungry and broke, so he asks David, who's driving, to stop at an ATM. Through a series of misadventures like those you're used to seeing in both horror movies and stupid teen sex comedies, all three of them end up in the ATM vestibule. (Unfortunately, this is where the teen sex comedy similarity ends.) When they go to leave the vestibule, standing between them and their car is a masked man wearing an anorak (the anorak becomes important). They figure he's just waiting in line to use the machine until a random guy walking his dog wanders into the parking lot, and is quickly, and brutally, dispatched. The movie then becomes a waiting game, with the three players inside trapped and trading recriminations, while the anonymous killer just stands there, watching, and occasionally disappears in order to make amusing thumping noises to scare the victims.I'm willing to write off a lot in horror movies (for example, what most people are thinking is the Big Twist part of the Big Twist Ending is a simple misunderstanding that will be cleared up by all the principal parties five minutes after the camera stops rolling) without taking points off; that's just part of being a fan of the genre. And like I said before, it comes with the territory that you're dealing with stupid people making stupid decisions. The problems arise when the script fails in its continuity  for example, have one character being so close to cold related death as to be delirious halfway through the film, and then, five minutes later and with no added heat source, having that character be the most lucid in the vestibule (for the rest of the film). Annoyances like this, when it comes to movies like this, are absolutely legitimate, and should be criticized. But it's not an awful movie, even if it is yet another entry in an oversaturated genre. If you can dismiss the silly continuity errors (and get past the fact that while Brian Geraghty is a solid character actor, he may not be quite ready for leads yet), it's good enough late night Netflix viewing if nothing else looks appealing. **","Ridiculous, but not nearly as awful as you've heard.",1358467200,"01 18, 2013",2,-1

"It's a snobbish clich&eacute; to pronounce the book on which any film material was based as being much better than the film. But in this case, I'm not trying to demonstrate my literacy with the recommendation. It's my sincere opinion.This movie just doesn't make the grade. It graduates from the merely pedantic to the completely far fetched. Like the book, it posits a serial killer who is playing abstruse mathematical games with Professor Seldom and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; at Oxford's Mathematical Institute. However, the film throws in all sorts of extra glancing mathematical references   to Fermat's Last Theorem, to Fibonacci's series, and to chaos theory. A lot of these references don't exist in the book or else are more integral aspects of the book. So the movie is like a Koosh ball, sprouting all sorts of alien little rubbery protrusions that make it briefly tantalizing, but that ultimately just cause it to come off as silly.The movie reminds me of Tom Stoppard's play ""Arcadia."" While that play was acclaimed, when you thought about it logically, you realized that all its talk about chaos theory was completely adventitious and unnecessary.There are other problems with this movie. Scenes that were treated more realistically in the book become grotesqueries in the movie. The film tries to combine the most garish elements of ""The DaVinci Code,"" a CSI episode, and ""The Zodiac Killer.""Whereas in the book, the protagonist's Russian roommate is just a normal person, in the movie he is portrayed by an actor who inexplicably chews up the scenery like a rabid dog. In the book, Seldom's former eccentric, obsessed colleague is indeed a hopeless case in the extended care ward of a hospital; but in the movie the man is presented as a shocking mutilation of a figure. In the book, Seldom is an average looking 50 year old professor; in the movie he is played by John Hurt whose already world weary face is photographed as ravaged superannuation. The book's brief, innocent sex scenes become rawly carnal in the film. In the book, inappropriate romances that are barely suggested or suspected are made explicit and decisive in the film. The film also adds a further twist ending to the solution of the murders that is sort of interesting and integrating, but that ultimately makes a triangle with 190 degrees of all the antecedent action.Not that the book is perfect. Author Guillermo Martinez failed to adequately explain a key puzzle and carelessly leaves some dangling plot points. But the book is more satisfyingly grounded than this hodgepodge of a film.

The plot is up his alley, but I think no one would be able to take his obsession with explosions.  If you get me.Secondly, I have no idea why you might WANT to watch this movie.  You have to be REALLY bored, 12 years old, or just love butt horror.  (Is that a genre now?)Here's why:I love a couple of the cast, so I thought it might be funny.  Unfortunately, it is just slow and silly.  What is funny is that the acting is pretty great!  I guess, if it had been written well, Bad Milo might have been a comedic hit.Instead it is a smirk fest.

"Update. Nope, I tried again to view an entire episode further into the season and just couldn't do it. As the show title states: she's an addict and she needs help. Addiction of any kind is not healthy for family life.This is not a ""How To"" series designed to instruct anything other than time consuming and money sucking an addiction is. Well, I guess it could be useful, if you don't think of it as a show about house projects proper.This show, along with the many other shows from the diynetwork are contrived and set up. Sadly, that network started with good intentions, but fell victim wanting to produce commercially viable fodder rather than to truly provide actual helpful information.  It's contrived; staged, drama, awkward.To start, the show is only 23 minutes long and there are recaps of recaps of recaps before AND after the edited removed commercial breaks which cuts down on actual ""show"". The editing is incredibly erratic. In the first episode, there's an inspection of work that hasn't been discussed yet, let alone shown in progress until you watch the second episode and then it's glossed over. It's unrealistic timewise. She states specific times, but according to the weather and the state of the landscaping it sure ain't the three weeks she's whining about.  I'm guessing she got this gig because she's petite and blonde.As a single mom, who is a real estate agent as well as house flipper who *supposedly* does the majority of the work on the houses AND is the subject of a TV series, I wonder how she finds time to parent her child.It pains me to write this because I am such a huge freak fan of DIY shows and was doing the Snoopy Happy Dance delighted to FINALLY see one of these shows on AmazonPrime (not even Netflix shows them)!  I was all settled down to have my marathon DIY fest and then reality set in as I watched the first episode.

"I heard a whole lot of comparisons between this film andThe Cabin In The Woodsbefore I decided to give this one a try. And why not? The latter film is probably one of my top three favorite ""horror"" films of all time, and definitely the smartest nod to the genre I've ever witnessed, regardless of how funny or scary you think it is. This film, written long before CABIN IN THE WOODS, tries to approach that same level of wit and insight into the genre, but the problem is that the script is just too shoddy to pull it off.The film follows two gentlemen in a cabin in the woods (natch). One of them    a young husband and father to be named Michael    has come to visit Chris    his old, estranged, meth smoking friend    in an attempt to finally wean him off of the drug. Michael takes an old school approach to rehab, handcuffing his friend to a pipe and letting him sweat it out, and as the two bicker (with fairly repetitive and awkwardly curse laden dialogue) and relive old times, strange pictures, films, books, and recordings begin popping up around the cabin. Where are these things coming from? What do they mean? Will Chris    the healthiest looking meth addict you've ever seen (check out those biceps!)    be able to kick his habit? Will Michael allow his own pride to blind himself to the fact that something seriously creepy deepy is going on?The idea behind the film is great. I give it five stars. I don't even fault the film for its low budget execution, which is pretty solid, all things considered. The film is a mediation on the art of story telling, especially with regards to horror films, and its constant nods to various horror tropes    aliens, strange disappearances, Native American burial grounds, ghosts, creepy religious types, foreign scientists    is cute enough, but none of it is particularly compelling. Even when something pretty creepy does happen    a mysterious person stares at our leads through the window or a recording of them appears unannounced    one or both of the characters inexplicably doesn't care, which effectively neuters the response of the audience. If viewers are supposed to be yanked to the edges of their seats, so should our characters, and what they mainly do is just argue about drugs, friendship, and life.Not until the last twenty minutes of the film do things begin to gain some kind of steam, but it's an old fashioned case of too little too late. By then, the bizarre occurrences of the film have become very obvious (i.e. heavy handed) symbols. This is further hammered home by Michael's insistence on referring to every set of photos, every scratchy record, every cave painting as a ""story."" This kind of overdone symbolism is especially weird considering the film's general insistence on remaining aloof from the typical spoon feeding you get from most scary films. Smart viewers will get what's going on, but there's bound to be a sizable chunk of the audience who will finish the movie and wonder, ""What was that last shot about?"" In case you missed Michael pounding it into the dialogue: it's about something, somewhere that wants a story.The trippiness of the overall story just doesn't hold enough water to compel the plot, is the problem. And in a movie that is all about the things that make a story worthwhile and that even cause stories to exist to begin with, it's a shame that the producers focused so much on creating a powerful ending without thinking about what it takes to have an equally powerful beginning and middle. As a result, you have a movie that's too smart for its britches, that seems to have been made backwards, with its strongest and greatest ideas placed at the end. But like a powerful anchor attached to sewing thread, this film's ending is stuck to an hour of quiet nonaction that is not particularly creepy, interesting, or even all that sensible (did I mention that our film's meth head looks like he could be a lightweight boxing champion?), and so the density of the finale makes the preceding hour of movie seem even fluffier and more pointless than it already is, rendering the entire experience kind of a rip off.",A Resolution Without A Beginning,1383004800,"10 29, 2013",2,-1

"So how is it that Disney's latest uplifting sports drama, Million Dollar Arm, which is the true story of Major League Baseball's first Indian born players, somehow is REALLY about how a rich, white sports agent saved them from an unfulfilled life? The stories of Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel (Madhur Mittal) are of the underdog variety in every sense of the word, capable of warming the coldest of hearts and making you feel a little bit better about the bloated sport of baseball, all while providing an ethnic twist on a formula Disney has perfected over generations.  But rather than taking the opportunity to go in a somewhat different direction, we're treated to the same old slow pitch fluff that can be seen coming from a mile away.Ironic that Mad Men star Jon Hamm leads the ensemble as struggling sports agent J.B. Bernstein, because somebody at Disney must have pitched the Hell out of this movie to get him to sign on. Bernstein gambled and left his cushy gig with an established firm to start his own, and now it's not looking like such a smart move. With all of his big money clients gone and their one major prospect bailing, Bernstein takes another huge risk. A moment of late night enlightenment involving a cricket match and Susan Boyle convinces him that the best way to turn things around is holding a reality TV competition in Mumbai. Gather India's best cricket bowlers and somehow turn them into Major League baseball pitchers, and in the process tap into that lucrative South Asian market. Problems solved. It's a ridiculous plan nobody thinks he can pull off, but Bernstein is desperate to maintain his lifestyle of fast cars and faster women. Speaking of women, he's renting out a room to a sexy med student (Lake Bell) who is destined to be a love interest. No two ways about it. It's formulaic claptrap but enjoyable and relatively inoffensive claptrap thanks to Hamm, Bell, and co star Aasiv Mandvi who give the story some comedic punch early on. Plus, Hamm plays a great unaware douchebag. The only thing he does better is silent torment, and that comes later.Once in India the film simply hits all of the stereotypes like this were batting practice. Bernstein can't stand the heat, can't endure the traffic, and can't eat the food. The one baseball scout he can get to make the trip is a surly old curmudgeon, naturally played by Alan Arkin, who thinks the whole thing is a disaster. That is until he starts hearing some real juice. That's right, hearing it. He doesn't even open his eyes unless he hears a pitch go over 80mph, and they come from strong armed lads Rinku and Dinesh.  Still untrained in how to pitch like a real baseball player (one uses a weird crane technique like The Karate Kid); Bernstein flies them back to Los Angeles to work with a skeptical pitching guru (Bill Paxton).Screenwriter Tom McCarthy (Win Win, The Station Agent) vacillates from bland inoffensiveness to ethnic awkwardness. Take for instance Bernstein's cartoonishly eager jazzistant, Amit, played by Bollywood actor Pitobash Tripathy. Apparently he's failed to realize this isn't a Bollywood movie because the level of overacting on his part, while charming at times, is mostly a distraction. Once back home there's little effort to go beyond the fish out of water standard. Rinku and Dinesh eat too much pizza, struggle to learn baseball, marvel at Bernstein's mjazzive home and gawk at his neighbor. We get a few brief moments where the pressure seems to get to them, and in these quiet asides we see that Sharma, who was so good in Ang Lee's Life of Pi, is the real deal as an actor. Performances aren't the problem here. Even Bell makes the most out of a stock role that is way beneath her at this point, and Arkin chews up the grjazz as we'd expect him to. But it's Hamm who has to carry most of the burden and he does seem to be the many sides of Don Draper most of the time. Bernstein is a manly guy whose masculinity is measured by his success, and when that starts to crumble so does he. Hamm wears the uncertainty and anger Bernstein carries well, and while the film as a whole isn't much he gives a game effort.The problem is that the story is framed to follow Bernstein's quest for success, not Rinku and Dinesh's journey to the big leagues. There's very little actual baseball seen here, yet even less of the two boys acclimating to a place of total excess. The fish out of water aspect is unfortunately played up for laughs (which are few) rather than insight, and basically the whole thing feels very safe and sanitized. Craig Gillespie's direction is bright, sunny, and indistinct, while McCarthy's script lacks his usual nuance. One of McCarthy's greatest traits, seen in literally every one of his films, is the ability to show how strangers can find a common bond and become a family. He tries to do that here but never quite pulls it off.  Million Dollar Arm fits in the tradition of other crowd pleasing, inspirational sports dramas, and for that reason it will surely have most audiences cheering. For that reason the film is more of a base hit than a total strike out.",A Base Hit Rather Than Home Run,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",2,-1

"""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" stars Jean Claude Van Damme, Scott Adkins, Andrei ""The Pit Bull"" Arlovski and Dolph Lundgren (credited in that order). The new Universal Solider film is directed by John Hyams, responsible for so so action flick ""Universal Soldier: Regeneration"" (2009) and just plain terrible ""Dragon Eyes"" (2012).First things first. ""Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"" is not a Jean Claude Van Damme movie. Van Damme's role here is only as an extended cameo, and his fight scene is rather brief, and so is that of Dolph Lundgren. I don't even know if I should call it a Universal Soldier movie, as in ""Day of Reckoning"" there is hardly any sci fi element that was still seen in ""Regeneration.""Still I expected something exciting from the film as the star of ""Day of Reckoning"" is Scott Adkins, who can really do action. Adkins plays a man named John, who, heavily injured, wakes up in a hospital to learn that his beloved wife and daughter were brutally murdered by masked intruders. So far, so good.As the story goes on, however, it becomes clear that the film is going nowhere. Action is brutal and gory (that's fine), but terribly drawn out and poorly edited. The confusing story (including the lengthy non action opening scene that should be much shorter) doesn't make much sense. There is one decent car action sequence, but ... is Scott Adkins, a martial artist, hired for this?As you know, Van Damme, Adkins and Lundgren were also seen in ""The Expendables 2.""

"There's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption. Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive, but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience. Instead of writing something that he could be proud of, he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted. In many ways, the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue. In the third season of Veronica Mars, Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one off episodes that didn't tie into the arcs. Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans, Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school. The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be. Buffy recovered from the same setback, but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate &#34;LOVE ME&#34; vibe that wrecked the last season. A little fan service is nice. It's cool to see Mac and Wallace again. Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine. It's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet, a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating. Do we really need to get Piz again? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores. Does Madison have to be a one dimensional villain ten years later? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law. Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2. The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1. When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead cljazzmates, you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service, the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story. It's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get. Unfortunately, as you are referring to the Wiki, you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery   which should already be obvious since it follows the &#34;really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role&#34; pattern.This isn't a bad movie.

"Seal Team VI is like all other war films supported by the Department Of Defense. The story line is pretentious as is the dialogue created for the characters. There is way too much chest pounding and too little action in Seal Team VI, which relies more on DOD supplied war footage than action scenes created by all involved in making this movie. I was really embarrjazzed for the producers, the director and the writers, who in their mind's eyes made a homage to the Seal Team program. This film is as bad as &#34;The Green Berets,&#34; starring John Wayne, which was  a homage to the Army's elite unit, the Green Berets. People with service backgrounds should stay away from being creative, and leave it to the professionals. The DOD influence just muddies the creative waters. Only Oliver Stone served up a film depicting his Vietnam experience that proved to be Oscar worthy in his 1986 film,&#34;Platoon.&#34; These other wanna be film makers fell on their face in their attempts and Jeremy Davis, in my opinion, is one of them.","If You're Looking For A Great War Film, Look Somewhere Else",1400112000,"05 15, 2014",2,-1

"This could easily be one of those lampoons done by the Scary Movie franchise  My favorite scene was the female officer hanging on to back of the getaway ambulance.  What was she doing back there?  She was spread eagled on the back bumper with hardly a hand hold.  Was this supposed to be a dramatic act of heroics?  It looked like the rest of the group wouldn't let her ride inside because she was a minority.  Never the less, she seemed grateful to be allowed to ride on the back bumper and helplessly hang on for dear life as the ambulance sped through the city.Eventually, they make it out of the city after being chased by an angry mob and find refuge in the old lady's mansion, whereupon it only seems appropriate that the sexy babe character would strip entirely naked and go swimming  in the pool, because you see, they are all in the middle of an obvious crisis situation, and that's what would happen in the Scary Movie franchise.",Good for a Laugh,1392595200,"02 17, 2014",1,-1

"I was extremely disappointed by ""The Great Buck Howard"".The Great Buck Howard (John Malkovich) is a stage performer way past his prime.  A mentalist, he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading, hypnotism and other mental games. The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience, while still very enthusiastic, is aging and dwindling. In his heyday, he appeared on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson"" sixty three times, a fact he mentions repeatedly, and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard, a title he has determinedly kept ever since. Preparing for his big comeback, his business manager (Ricky Jay) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager. Troy Gable (Colin Hanks, son of Tom) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer. But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills, so he interviews to work with Buck. He gets the job and heads out with the performer, making sure Buck's every request is filled, that the venues have everything set up, stagehands are ready to go, and the like. The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such. Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new ""The Tonight Show"" and plans a big stunt, guaranteed to kick start his comeback. He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist. Valerie Brennan (Emily Blunt, ""Sunshine Cleaning"", ""The Devil Wears Prada"") shows up and begins to set everything in place. But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly, ""The Great Buck Howard"" misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable. It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self perceived fame and glory. Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts, ""I love this town,"" and he really seems to mean it. He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience. But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show. Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we can't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny. We have seen this type of character before. Many times. And many of these performances have been more insightful, more daring and more interesting.For ""Buck Howard"" to work, we need to realize the character knows his career is fading. He doesn't seem to. He enjoys the shows so much, you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun. In fact, much of the time, he seems to be trying to make Troy's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self aware. If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing, are we supposed to either laugh at or with, or feel empathy towards him? He isn't desperate enough and enjoys what he does, even on a smaller scale, too much.Colin Hanks is OK, but he spends most of the time standing to one side, observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression. The only clues we seem to get come from his narration. And his narration never seems to stop, rambling on and on. Film is a visual medium, a visual art form, so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading. Narration is useful and necessary in some instances. It isn't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen, when we can't tell this visually. At least it shouldn't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film, both bad. In ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", Woody Allen uses an omniscient (and ever present) narrator to tell us the feelings, thoughts, likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen. It quickly grates on the viewer's nerves. Worse, the narrator isn't even a character in the story. It's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes. The narration in ""Buck Howard"" seems designed for a different purpose. In many low budget, independent films, a narrator provides a useful tool. They tell us about things, bridging the gap in the stories, saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed. I generally overlook this, because it isn't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film. In ""Buck Howard"", I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons, to help show things they couldn't afford to film, but Hank's descriptions go beyond this. They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling, thinking, want to do and accomplish. Why aren't we seeing this in the characters themselves? Why do we have to be told this?Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film. He stands to the side a lot, observing, watching, rarely speaking. When he does, he always seems kind of flat, as though he can't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions. I can't help but think how much different his father's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt's Valeria shows up, Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship. Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air. Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation. From New York, it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world. She moves faster, registers faster, reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town. As soon as she meets Troy, she begins to flirt with him (she must see something we don't) and he picks up on it, relishing the new relationship. At one point, Valerie can't help but laugh at one of Buck's statements, providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck's official hosts in Cincinnati. It is an amusing idea, but the roles don't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei (Mr. Sulu on ""Star Trek). But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat. It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect ""The Great Buck Howard"" will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity, much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy.",Disappointing,1239753600,"04 15, 2009",2,-1

"Let's face it; when a person dies, most likely he just vanishes into the ether.  And no matter what people think, that same person probably did not exist before birth either.  (I'll accept life at conception as well.)  But good luck trying to prove life after death, heaven or hell, etc. etc.  Any of these positions is unprovable so arguing is just a waste of time.I did think about the film ""The Exorcist"" while watching ""My Amityville Horror.""  If you've ever watched that much earlier and much better film on disk, William Friedkin gives a very nice introduction beforehand by saying something like, ""What you bring to the film you will get out of it.  If you believe in evil, it will affect you in a certain way.  If you don't, then your experience will be different.""  I'm paraphrasing a bit, but that was pretty much the gist of it.  But in retrospect, I do believe that Mr. Friedkin wasn't exactly correct; I believe that ""The Exorcist"" is a danged scary movie no matter what belief system you have.And this documentary tries to spook you a little bit as well, but I don't think that it actually works.  No, let's say that it fails miserably.  Just because someone such as Lorraine Warren makes some jazzertion doesn't mean that I will necessarily believe that jazzertion myself.  And let's face another fact; without going for some cheap ad hominems    which I could easily do and have seen others try with this film    I didn't find Daniel Lutz to be exactly the most credible witness ever.  It made me think of another documentary that I didn't much like, ""I Survived BTK.""  Both films should have been quite gripping, but in reality, I found both of them to be quite suspect, mostly because of issues with the main characters in both films.I have seen the original ""Amityville Horror"" quite a few times, and I still remember watching it the first time.  While I was much younger, it did scare the hell out of me, especially the scene in the basement where the dog gets dragged down to hell, jazzuming that hell exists.  It's too bad that this film didn't get my attention as much as that one, at least in other ways.  After thinking about it for one night, I'm changing my score from a 3 to a 2, and that's mostly because I turned it off with about 10 minutes to go.

"The premise of ""ATM""   three people trapped in an ATM vestibule   is created by Chris Sparling, writer of another confined space thriller ""Buried"" starring Ryan Reynolds. In ""ATM,"" while withdrawing money from an ATM on the way home from a Christmas party, two young men and woman David (Brian Geraghty), Corey (Josh Peck) and Emily (Alice Eve) are trapped in an ATM booth by a hooded stranger, whose intent is not friendly.Though the story itself is not implausible, the way it unfolds feels so contrived and unrealistic that most viewers would stop caring what is going on. Without revealing too much of the film, I can say that 30 minutes into the film things start getting silly. The more elaborate the story gets, the less thrilling the film becomes, making us think about simpler solutions for the three characters.With convincing psychological interactions between the characters (including the stranger standing outside), ""ATM"" would have been much more entertaining.

"Yet another &#34;apocolypse&#34; show written by &#34;big city dwellers&#34; who have a total &#34;city centered&#34; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows &#34;disaster&#34; is not too bad.  We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path.  The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies.  with the exception of one or two &#34;farms,&#34; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits.  A character is either &#34;of the town&#34; or an &#34;outsider&#34; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world, outside of a big city.

The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompjazz surrounding rural areas.  This is not europe and the local twons here are not, and never were, the local strongholds, complete with castle.No, while the initial premise of this series is well thought out, the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America.

"[The review contains minor spoilers.]""Vanishing on 7th Street"" starts with a bang and slowly descends into something dull and formulaic. The thriller drama (directed by Brad Anderson, much better ""The Machinist"") begins with a great premise, building up the tension in the first fifteen minutes until it suddenly loses steam, having nothing new or interesting to add to the thin story that goes nowhere.The opening sequence is just brilliant. Paul (understated and effective John Leguizamo) is a projectionist working at a packed Detroit theater. Then, suddenly the light fails. The next moment Paul finds himself alone (well, almost) in the silent theater   everyone is gone, perhaps everyone in the entire city. The fact is, Paul   and a news reporter Luke (Hayden Christensen), a therapist Rosemary (Thandie Newton) and a young boy named James (Jacob Latimore)   are among the ""survivors"" of the mysterious blackout.In this kind of suspense (like ""The Birds"") you don't have to explain everything, as long as you can keep the viewers interested in what is going on. Unfortunately this does not happen in ""Vanishing on 7th Street."" Information is given bit by bit   long nights, a man in Chicago, the Roanoke Colony, and most importantly, rules for survival   but they add up to nothing. Characters attempt to theorize about the meaning of total ""wipeout,"" but what they talk about is just dull. Some ideas are directly borrowed from other apocalyptic horror movies.

"So much has been said of this show already.  Let's get to the point:Half the cast is great.  Half the cast is too green, inexperienced, and frankly young.  No one will believe that SHIELD agents should look like the rejected cast of Friends.  The show makers do not take the organization seriously.  SHIELD, instead of being a hardened group of super agents, is a gaggle of barely legal noobs.The show burdens us with forced humor, corny dialogue, and uninteresting scenes.There are no superheroes or supervillains taken advantage of.  Instead of mining the rich depths of Marvel lore, they hand us a brainfart of a hero who jumps out of a burning building and SHOCKS everyone.  Shocks everyone!?!  Really!?!  In world where aliens just invaded!?!  Where a Norse GOD just said hello!?!  Where Iron Man flies around?  Where the INCREDIBLE HULK just saved everyone's lives!?!The atmosphere of the show is one akin to the old A Team series.  Violence with no consequences.  Boring or lame characters introduced each show.  Obviously manufactured storylines.  There is no atmosphere of foreboding, mystery, awe, or fear.  Which, to me, seems integral to the success of a show trying to display mankind's reaction to the burgeoning supervillain and monster infested reality we all find ourselves living in.What a flop.  Avoid at all costs.  It does not take the Marvel Universe seriously.  It adds nothing.  Instead of presenting SHIELD as an investigative, subterfuge filled, espionage oriented, and artifact retrieval unit struggling to even the odds for mankind, this show gives us a flaccid comedic parody of the deadly serious organization from the comics.Stan Lee help us.",Big Missed Opportunity Here,1391817600,"02 8, 2014",1,-1

"In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president, a chemo virus has broken out in a small town. The Z Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem, but a member of the squad gets infected and flees. He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club, which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future. The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club's biggest star as his first victim. She continues to dance and the odd thing is...the customers love it. Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal. As the money piles up, so do the victims. Will the chemo virus continue to spread and if so...how will it be contained?First of all, don't be confused. This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever. I almost turned it off several times and I honestly can't tell you why I'm reviewing this thing. The sad thing is it's like a trainwreck in slow motion. You can't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it's going to end, but who's going to make it out alive. Not that you really care, but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck. It is ludicrous, ridiculous, and absurd...but it's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it? Let's see...strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers, zombies being sexy, having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor...ever, the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund, special effects you'd find in Xena: Warrior Princess, a Christian stripping for her nanna, Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her...well...I'll let you see that for yourself, angry dragons, and foamy chewbaccas...the list goes on and on. I'm sure I missed so many more. The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is, there's still a few good things buried under the cheese. It's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese. All the cheap stuff is on the outside, but there's some good stuff on the inside. The most obvious being that there's a lot of nudity in this, which is good because it'll probably be one of the only things that'll keep anyone watching. Robert Englund's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable. Also, the make up effects are surprisingly good at times. The special effects are horrid, but the make up is actually better than you think it'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this, I can't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark. The thing is though if you stick with it, it's actually enjoyable because it's so bad. It's cheesy, it's amusing, the acting is so bad that you'll be quoting it for days, the plot is pointless, and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending! My point is that it's a bad film and I'm not defending it, but if you manage to sit through the whole thing...you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating: 4 10(most people will probably rate it a 1 10...if that)",Zombie Strippers Are The New Sex Appeal,1210809600,"05 15, 2008",2,-1

"The only thing I can say positive about Storage 24 is that the alien monster is great. It's an old fashion rubber monster man in a suit kind of thing. But in this modern age, such a cheesy effect is bound to turn more people off than to win them over. And this is without a single doubt the best part of this agonizingly bad, cheaply made grade B with a minus British made mix of sci fi and horror. A barrage of misogyny and stupidity that follows is bound to please only least demanding of paying customers, which I hope there are few.It all starts off with the slight twinkle of promise as an unexplained alien monster is on the loose inside of a storage unit. Also on the loose is a hand full of employees and patrons who are inexplicably trapped inside the storage facility with our guest from another world.So far, so good, but that's all about to change. because in no time at all, Storage 24 becomes a terrible prime time soap with a slimy monster who seems to change size given the requirements of any given scene. Sometimes he's human size, others he seems to tower above them. And this is only the beginning of this movies faults.Storage 24 was written by actors Noel Clarke and Marc Small, along with Davie Fairbanks, it is surprising in it's lack of good roles for just about anybody. The characters are simple one dimensional, obnoxious and unlikable. All the female roles are self center, treacheras witches. The men, self loathing cowards.The acting is just shy of dismal. Not one of the cast members manage to give any substance to their roles, a few of them look like they would rather be home watching telly, which you can`t blame them. Leading lady Antonio Campbell Hughes is a new kind of low for any actor who is not a professional athlete or musician making there way intro film.Given this material, one could imagine a very funny movie from Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, but alas, it is not meant  to be. Storage 24 is ungodly stupid, uninspired and worst painfully dull. Little more than a sub par retread of many other similar movies, some better, few not. The one that Storage 24 most resembles is that great summer turkey the Watch, perhaps my least favorite movie of last year. Yes, the kind of movie we all want to see more of. Showing that it isn't just us yanks who are creatively bankrupt.There is an appalling lack of interest here and zero energy to sustain the long 87 minute running time. Director Johannes Roberts, behind the gladly unseen DTD flicks like Hellbender and Forest of the Damned, clearly has no eye for the camera. Shot in a single location, not only does that let you know it's cheap, it just looks it and feels it even more. Roberts has given us an amateur hour and a half here. You wont be able to believe such a movie is still released into American cinemas. Even going in with low expectations,  you will be astonished at how low they would have had to have been.In my original review for Movie Zone, I gave this stinker a half of a star, but amazon wont let me do that.

"I waited eagerly for this film to come out.  The book was fabulous on so many levels. It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick gljazzes she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets.

"This satiric take on the epic mini series of the seventies and eighties is a one trick, one joke pony. The idea is to make fun of the tropes and melodrama of the epic, best selling, historical romances that proliferated during the period. All of the familiar elements are present: the wealthy but troubled family with secrets, their home, sometimes with hints of the gothic that represents a character in itself, unrequited love, revenge, death, business and wealth.In the real world, there is the mineable territory of Hollywood with its excesses and egotistical stars, directors and writers. S of B takes them all on, making fun of the mini series and novels that it lampoons. Conclusion? These books and the productions based on them were melodrama that took themselves far too seriously and had quality issues of writing, directing, acting and production. That's it. That's the joke....full stop.I could get on board if I was getting a decent story and characters supporting the joke, but we don't because to give good story and characters the production team would have to resort to the techniques and tropes of  the genre they're satirizing and they can't do that because that would cut the legs from under their one joke pony.

"Leave it to Eli Roth (director of Hostel) to keep his record intact involving absolutely disgusting movies.  In this one, he plays a dad touring Chili (I think) with two other dudes  Roth's idea of a manflick, I suppose  and constantly trying to hook up with someone.  Trouble is, Roth's character is so gooberish, he would have trouble hooking up at a hookers convention, but I digress.  He and his buddies finally make it with some American chicks to supposedly the ultimate party when disaster strikes in the form of an earthquake.  Suddenly, it's now about how to survive the disaster.  That premise alone might have worked for the film.  What follows does not.If you're asking what follows, I'll give you a little clue:  it seems that during really hellish times in Chili, i.e. MAJOR earthquakes (not to mention that bells are sounding to alert the locals of an apparent tsunami), you now have to worry about thugs crawling the streets who are out to do nothing but rape, torture, and pillage.  That seems to be Roth's speciality, and he is just not content with showing a little carnage; no, the viewer must get the entire buffet.  We have people who are doused with gasoline and then set ablaze (even though they're already crushed by falling rocks), we have impalements, and, oh yeah, we also have a very violent rape.  I understand libido, but if I have to choose between sex and survival, uh, call me maybe?And the ending is about as much a surprise as finding a cherry inside a chocolate covered cherry.  I hope the 12 year old that gave Roth the suggestion at least got credit and payment for his thought.  Rated ""R"" for very good reasons, this is NOT a movie for anyone under 18.

"Being a fan of all these ladies, I was expecting something along the lines of ""Bridesmaids"" with a hint of ""Mean Girls,"" both films I liked.  Unfortunately what I got was a mean spirited, unfunny story about 3 unpleasant and unlikeable women, all of whom are too attractive to be in such a state of despair.Regan (Kirsten Dunst) is the maid of honor for Becky (Rebel Wilson) who no one thought would ever get married.  Certainly not before Regan or her other two gal pals, Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and Katie (Isla Fisher).  The trio has never outgrown their party days from high school.  In one scene, Gena gets on a plane stoned and gets into a conversation with a seat mate (Horatio Sanz credited as ""Barely Attractive"") about how she manages to give a man felacio on a scale of 4 to 10.  The film is full of raunchy dialog and the ladies lead the way.  This doesn't bother me but I checked out when Gena hooks up with a former boyfriend (Adam Scott).  After the wedding, Clyde (Scott) stands up and rather than toast the new couple, tells everyone how he bedded Gena and went ""in and out, in and out.""  Really?The middle section of the film is forgettable and hinges on the girls being able to repair the bride's dress that they tore apart while high on coke.  While all this sex talk might make you think, this is going to get better, it doesn't.  All the characters keep their clothes on.  In fact when the boys go out to a strip club the night before the wedding, they don't seem to be concerned at all that the strippers...well... keep their clothes on.  Huh?

However, by that point I was so annoyed by the cast that I didn't want to spend any more time with them.

For most of the show, it seemed like people were just going crazy because the power went out. I know us Angelenos wild out when it rains but I don't think chaos would ensue after a power outage like this; nor do I understand why two helicopters would crash into each other because of it.In the end, this just feels like another &#34;Lost&#34; rip off, which is a huge problem for a company trying to break into original programming since &#34;Lost&#34; rip offs started getting tired more than a few years ago.Unless Amazon decides to pander to the religious demographic and really push that angle hard, I don't see any reason to pick this show up.",Wholly unlikeable characters,1393718400,"03 2, 2014",2,-1

"Wow...I wont go into details, who the writer is, producer, actors, or compare it much to anything.  I took this film because there was a time where I just could not get enough of IFC films.  This movie although everyone seems to hate the plot?  I think the plot was okay. It is not cut and dry that a lesbian turns into a zombie after a one night stand. What bothered me was I thought the plot was okay. Not great but worth a watch. Then The actress who plays the lead (Sam) is fantastic.  You will see her in future films trust me.  But once you know what is wrong with her, and you know early on, the movie leads you nowhere. The whole movie is about watching her decay?  That is it.  I wont give the ending away.  I will just say I don't think there was an ending.  It started out with an idea, but never went forward, and then completely just went flat.  There were events that made no sense, and had nothing to do with the story. They took a good idea, and turned it into a B movie.  What a shame.  I think you will be very unhappy if you watch it. I wont say don't watch it, because everyone should make up their own mind. This was really a bad movie. I would not have watched it for free if i had the chance if i knew what it was before hand.  The only thing good was the  main character. Meaning her as an actress.  She goes to a party, she is in love with a girl who wants her space. She has sex with a guy you don't see.  And then she looks to be pregnant and then gets really sick which people are calling her a zombie.  I don't know what she is or what the point was?  And when you see the end?  I think you will be highly upset.  Oh, and she sees the doctor two times, and not once does she get sent to a hospital.

"It wasn't exactly easy to make it to the end of the tone deaf comedy ""Lay The Favorite."" When I got there, though, I was in for a huge shock. The credits rolled and I realized that Stephen Frears was responsible for directing this! In case you haven't heard of him, the Oscar nominee has orchestrated some truly great films including The Queen, The Grifters, and Dangerous Liaisons. Well nothing could be further from these excellent films than this flight of fancy. Based on a true story, an expose on the world of gambling by Beth Raymer, the plot had the potential to be absolutely fascinating. In fact, I'd love to read Raymer's memoir. I think it would be very enlightening. But instead of a hard hitting drama, Frears has removed any sense of reality from the picture. I don't care that he wanted to make something light and comedic, but this isn't serious enough for a drama, funny enough for a comedy, informative enough for gambling enthusiasts, or rich enough in character so that anyone might actually care about what happens. In short, the movie has no idea what it wants to be and that is very apparent.Rebecca Hall plays the central character as a chirpy stripper who is simultaneously brilliant and clueless. She dreams of the big time, she wants to be a waitress in Las Vegas! She gets involved, instead, with an odds maker played by Bruce Willis. She's a natural at the game and soon becomes invaluable to the operation. Willis's wife (Catherine Zeta Jones) doesn't like the closeness between the two and this causes much friction. As Hall sets out on her own, she gets into some trouble from which she may not be able to extricate herself. Hint: It involves Vince Vaughn. It just might require a little help from her friends and a caper is afoot. And boy, there's no stopping this crew when they are joined!One of my biggest issues with ""Lay The Favorite"" is that it is all over the map in tone. And none of it really works, nothing is developed in enough depth to get you involved. Even the gambling aspect of the picture is lackluster and pedestrian. I never cared about anything that happened. Willis seems to be sleepwalking, Hall is positively grating, and everyone else is pretty much wasted. Hall has a love affair with Joshua Jackson, but we never know the first thing about him. The character development is so sketchy as to be virtually non existent. A few of the smaller roles scored and Zeta Jones has presence. The experience, for me, had no real laughs, no real danger, no real romance. I've certainly been a fan of Frears, Willis and Zeta Jones in other projects. Here, though, I'm hard pressed to tell you anything that I like about this misguided effort.

"Season 1 of Under the Dome started off on a relative high note, and at the very least was intriguing enough to keep me watching as things fell apart. By the end, viewers were left with a ruin of jumbled concepts and terrible dialogue, as well as characters that the writers couldn't seem to agree on, each script pulling them in different directions. Instead of establishing psychological complexity, it left an impression of indecisive, inconsistent writing; and the details surrounding the revised and expanded plot line became straight up hilarious, taking one of King's stupider books and somehow managing to dumb it down further.I was interested to see if the producers might have been able to salvage something from the smoking rubble they had left themselves with, taking the downtime between filming periods to rebuild the story for season 2. But episode 1 made it pretty clear that Under the Dome is unfixable. Stephen King scripted the season premiere, which no doubt piqued the interest of even those viewers who had abandoned all hope during season 1, but my god... keep that man away from all film sets. While some of his books have been adapted into great films    The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Mist come to mind    whenever he gets involved in the transition process, things go horribly wrong. An unintentionally hilarious 'crisis' strikes Chester's Mill once again, as the now sentient Dome throws a hissy fit and somehow magnetizes itself. As metallic objects start flying through the air in the cheap, clunky manner of the original Star Trek, Under the Dome became a total write off.

Brilliant  film makers such as Enroll Morris know and understand that the subject weaves the story   there is no room what so ever for hokey ""re enactments"" and staged self serving dialogue.Director Chris James Thompson never moves past a dull and hollow presentation, there's no insight into Dahmer just a huge dependence on over played news footage and again community theater level  ""re enactments"" all this makes for is pretty awful story telling and worse movie making.Take a pjazz on this dreadfully dull failure and watch the Stone Phillips interview series on Dahmer I jazzure you it's riveting and I believe it's also available in it's entirety on youtube.",Dreadfully Dull Film Making Offers Nothing New,1362096000,"03 1, 2013",2,-1

"I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely. I'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with, too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just doesn't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy. But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it's believable, intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it. And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem inducing moments. (If you've seen the show you know what I'm talking about)Season 2 was equally great, more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others. WARNING: SPOILER ALERT HERE   But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought, ""Uh oh, am I going to even like Season 3?"" Granted while Shane wasn't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group. It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated, frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend, Rick. It's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that's what happened to Shane and then Rick, every the shining hero put an end to Shane's life. And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too. This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring. I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing. A kickbutt woman with a katana? How cool will that be, right?And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing...boredom. Sadly Michonne's character is taking forever to develop and sorry, but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me. I know Michonne's a strong, silent warrior type, but I don't know why since she's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it's place in the overall story. The Governor is also boring since again we know he's a bad guy who seems charming on the surface, but not really why outside of the usual cliched ""former nobody finds himself in power and aims to keep it that way no matter who he has to mow down along the way"" villian. And the survivors themselves haven't really gained much in the way of new developments either. All of this leads to a not very compelling story to watch and maybe it's just me, but I find myself having to use the pillow in my lap alot more this season. Even in places where I don't think we should have to like did we really have to see Hershel's foot getting cut off? That coupled with the fact that things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and there's no real reason to care or goal to be had makes me feel that this story is simply another one of the walking dead, shuffling along with a blank stare on its collective face. And I'm so jaded by this point I just dance out of the zombie's way a little bit then don't even bother with the head shot since it really just isn't anything I'm interested in dealing with now.

"This pilot revolves around Dorothy going to Oz in order to snag a birthday present for her Mom, but the inherent problem was how her mother knew about Oz immediately without question or concern. Along with how each of the character were already familiar with Dorothy. Setting the story in Kansas with tornadoes with Dorothy ''landing'' in Oz mysteriously would've been better. Putting more of the Oz mythos would've helped a great deal here. As does adding mystery, conflict, or a moral lesson. Also, the switch from traditional hand drawn animation to stop motion claymation, and finally to preliminary sketches was more than a tad jarring.That being said...I do think subverting the ruby slippers in favor of the golden magical hat was a nice change.Hope to see some improvement as this moves forward.","Nice, but a bit lightweight and odd",1366416000,"04 20, 2013",2,-1

"Zombie Strippers(released April 08)stars one of my fave actors,Robert Englund(forever Freddie Krueger in my heart),as the only real star amongst this  company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late,if you have seen any of my recent reviews,to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value,shall we say.Add yet another one to that list.*sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film,with some real kick to it,turns out to just....a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame,old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter,a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters""Pancho Villa....Montezuma...Caesar Chavez...Cinco de Mayo...guacamole..."".Yeah,funny,funny stuff,right? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club,who is deathly afraid of catching ""something"" off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the ""comic relief"",such as it is,comes in the form of the opening act,the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs,even if they had tried...oh yeah,they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job,but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window(great security).That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer stripper infects another dancer stripper,and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected,as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes,the strippers,after their dances,each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains,either heads,bodies without heads,bodies with heads,etc.,usually re animate and they lock them in jail like cells in the basement.Doesn't every strip club you know have jail cells?Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening,but before you can say ""bite me"",he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line,the Marine major leader finds out about the zombies at the club(he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside!).Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock(?).He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there's alot of money to be had in ""working for the man"".The Marines leave going to do...whatever they usually do,and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film,the special effects(heads being blown off,ripped apart,etc.)are on the whole not too shabby,as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon,another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18 25 yrs.,because there is ALOT of T&A; throughout the film,graphic at that(I think they called it nudity,once upon a time).It is this group that would probably love this film,for that alone.Males of ages before,shouldn't be viewing this at all and those after,will,for the most part,see the film for what it is....bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit&eacute; as the Russian Blavatski,who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top,but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually didn't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w s a r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes,deleted scenes & commentary.All in all,despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project,it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it's satire,send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job,as do the strippers(for the most part)and their handler Levite',but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pjazz.",Dusk to Dawn meets Bitch Slap meets Resident Evil !,1349395200,"10 5, 2012",2,-1

"I'm going to start off by saying that while I love and adore the original sets of V miniseries (V and V: THE FINAL BATTLE), I absolutely loathed the spin off weekly series. Waaaaay too soap opera for me.With the advent of smarter and deeper television over the last decade, I was first in line to give the new V series a chance, especially since it had featured so many actors that I had loved from other shows I loved (Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST, Morena Baccarin AND Alan Tudyk from FIREFLY and Laura Vandervoort from SMALLVILLE), and a modern sensibility brought to a great Sci Fi concept is usually a good thing (see BATTLESTAR GALACTICA).But where the old V miniseries succeeds is every place that the new V weekly series falls short.First, there's character: After watching the first ten episodes, I found, and not for nostalgia's sake, that I cared more about the original miniseries' characters over the course of 3 4 hours than I ever did about any of the characters on this incarnation. There is just nothing there to connect with. Mitchell's FBI mom character is the only one that has anything to work with and it's just not enough. Baccarin's Anna has none of the gleeful devilishness of the original series' Diana; Scott Wolf's Chad Decker is so much of a non entity that I'm surprised that he's even credited.Second, the plot: It's pretty much the same as the original, but the V's seem to be bringing more with them. And certainly their weapons are more high tech. And they've been here before, developing ""sleeper cells"" which is a change from the original. But in a Post 9 11 America, we sure are awful quick to accept the V's, which just doesn't hold water. And conversely, we're awful quick to determine that there has to be a Resistance against these evil V's... and this is all in the first episode.Third, the action: Where is it? There was never a moment of tension that was more than barely palpable in all the episodes I watched.In the final analysis, I stopped watching not because it doesn't match up to the original, but because it could be smarter and more tense, and it just isn't. I gave it chance after chance, but besides the few moments I thought worked, there were so many that didn't.I never thought that I'd be yearning for the days of Marc Singer, but the new V series does make you more than just nostalgic. It makes you wonder why, when there have been great Sci Fi shows like LOST, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FIREFLY, that this is a show that has been successful. It's obvious that ABC is looking for its next LOST, but V is not it. Not by a long shot.",Just didn't grab me...,1274486400,"05 22, 2010",2,-1

Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls.(The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman.)

"Here&#8217;s the thing about comedy: if you beg, borrow, or steal it, it usually isn&#8217;t as funny the second time around.  No matter how hard you try.  No matter how everyone involved tries.  It just won&#8217;t work the same way.  Ever have to explain a joke?  Ever notice how &#8211; in the process &#8211; everything remotely humorous about it gets sucked away with each pjazzing word?  Same thing.  When you pilfer from the best, you&#8217;re at least playing solid odds that whatever audience shows up will give you only gracious laughs but not necessarily ones all that legitimately earned.Humor works best when it comes from an original inspiration.  When all you do is take bits and pieces from what others have done before you (especially when it comes to comedy), then you should be fully prepared to be called a &#8216;hack.&#8217;  You deserve it, after all, and so does everyone who shows up to help you out.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)From the product packaging: &#8220;A Russian space station crashes in Amsterdam, releasing a deadly virus that turns everyday citizens into flesh craving psychopaths.  Aziz (Yahya Gaier), his brother Mo (Ouled Radi) and several strangers emerge from jail, oblivious to the mayhem until they team up with a local police officer (Gigi Ravelli).  After receiving a desperate call for help, this unlikely band of heroes sets out on an insane rescue mission &#8211; and it&#8217;s going to take a seriously crazy plan if they want to get out alive &#8230;&#8221;I&#8217;m a stickler for comedy, and, if you learned anything from what I wrote above, you know that I think it works best when it&#8217;s fresh, original, and timely.  That&#8217;s a mighty big success to achieve, and directors Martijn Smits and Erwin van den Eshof give it an affable try in a script that barely hints at anything original in it.  Sadly, we&#8217;ve seen these characters before (in much better films); and we&#8217;ve seen this set up and situation all too often (again, in far superior outings).  If this represents the best they have in their arsenal of entertainment, then the Dutch might wanna leave zombie comedies to the rest of the world.Naturally, there are a few tweaks here that work quite well, so KILL isn&#8217;t a complete failure.  Amsterdam has never looked better!  A Cold War era Russky soldier gets some of the best one liners in his five minutes of film!  Aziz&#8217;s &#8216;Holy Grail&#8217; turns out to be the official &#8216;Office Skank.&#8217;  At times, KILL musters a recognizable charm (that we&#8217;ve seen stronger elsewhere).  The problem is that it never mixes up its ingredients enough to force this mixture to congeal into the confection everyone involved probably thought it was going to be.For example, leading man Yahya Gaier seems all wrong here, so much so that he looks like he isn&#8217;t having all that much fun.  Likewise, his big screen brother (Radi) grins and goofs through his dialogue, though he never quite seems to tap into proper comic timing to make the best of the dire circumstances.  Dare I say, the only one who seems at home here is the fetching Ravelli &#8211; she dominates every scene she&#8217;s in the way a leading lady should &#8211; an actress who clearly understands what the script and directors wanted out of her and delivers in a big way.Too bad they couldn&#8217;t have used a few bucks from whatever budget they had to hire a decent continuity person, as the forever changing blood stain patterns on Gigi&#8217;s clean white blouse gets downright irritating in the second half.Or was that a joke, too?KILL ZOMBIE! (2012) is produced by Launch Works and Talent United Film & TV.  DVD distribution (stateside) is being handled by the stellar Well Go USA Entertainment.  For those folks needing it spelled out perfectly, this is a Dutch spoken language release with English subtitles available.  As for the technical specifications, this is a very well made release, and it dishes out some high quality sights and sounds (though a few effects sequences are pretty bad).  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then you&#8217;ll be sorely disappointed: there&#8217;s only a theatrical trailer to make your day.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  As charming as KILL ZOMBIE! is, it&#8217;s also quite obnoxious.  Unfortunately, the script by Tijs van Marle borrows only the best ideas of vastly superior films but never quite puts them to good use.  As a result, the story never metastasizes into anything so noble as those films it derives its narrative and situations from, practically sucking the life out of brewball moments that go on for too long.  Still, fanboys are likely to swoon over the unintentionally luscious Gigi Ravelli, the single best Dutch treat ever to put on the police uniform.  Be warned: she&#8217;ll have you wishing for the Apocalypse in no time at all.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of KILL ZOMBIE! by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Bumbling Muslims Save Zombie-Plagued Amsterdam.

"Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here, I don't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is. So, I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3. There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who aren't giving the 3rd season a fair jazzesment.There is not a single show on TV, not a single one, that my wife and I don't flock to week to week, other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception. As the 3rd season played out, we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season, all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger. A serial rapist. A murder on campus. All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then, when the show started back up, all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes. The following episodes were, for lack of better words, UNEVENTFUL. All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending. What did they do? What happened? Did the writers lose interest? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes? This is what I think. Personally, I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them.

"This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make. False advertising. They have the DVD cover and title in English... but to watch the movie, you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning. It is a sham to use false advertising to sell  to unsuspecting shoppers. They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he's used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don't blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English. If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with, we wouldn't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place. I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish. In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I don't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly don't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pjazz it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English.

"I am just not a fan of ""iCarly."" The gags are often focused on mildly humorous words or phrases used by some characters and often they are brought up several different times throughout the course of one scene or episode, or sometimes certain words that sound laughable are botched into nonsensical but bland phrases or are broken up and rearranged for humor. It just comes off as hokey and sometimes the jokes are something that I would usually expect out of a corny 1970s situation comedy. True, there have been a few jokes that have left me laughing uncontrollably, but they seldom appear and there have been times before where I have found it odd that I was not laughing at the kind of little jokes that normally are my sense of humor. Many people may believe that I am expecting too much of more recent television series to try and hold a candle to the quality of Nickelodeon programs that were broadcast during the 1990s and early 2000s, but I long for the nostalgia I feel when looking back on faint memories of those series.

"Following hot on the heels of FOX's runaway success ""Sleepy Hollow"", WGN throws their hat in the ring of prime time television with a blunt attempt at a more ""adult"" revisiting of New England's spooky lore.Unfortunately, ""Salem"" is historical revisionist drama by the numbers demonstrating a complete cultural and ideological disconnect to the period setting, featuring lurid thrills and a shallow undercurrent of eroticism where viewers are treated to a cast of hygienically challenged men, sexually repressed and typically hot women all set in an anachronistic, neo Wiccan Puritan dichotomy.For the record I love the horror genre (look at my review page if you're in doubt), but when it comes to unsympathetic or moronically inaccurate fiction that portrays a historical figure such as Cotton Mather (who graduated from Harvard at the age of 15, was a gifted preacher, theologian, historian and scholar of ancient languages, active in philanthropy ranging from the education of former slaves to pensions for retired clergy, a prolific author whose extant works are still considered examples of cljazzic American literature  and was not known to have attended a single witch trial) as an ignorant and bigoted zealot who spends his days behind a pulpit and his evenings at the local brothel is to me inexcusable and demonstrates more contempt than artistic license.Contempt seems to be a primary motivation behind the writing for this series best exemplified by the central character John Alden (think Hugh Jackman from ""Van Helsing"") who in an impjazzioned speech at a bloody trial, declares the citizens of Salem to be ""murdering, hypocritical, Puritan bastards"" thus giving modern audiences the opportunity to engage in something C.S. Lewis called chronological snobbery while simultaneously summarizing what little subtext this show possesses.""Salem"": intellectually shallow but heavy on gore and sex.... sounds like a recipe for success.  :o)",Witch Babes in Heat,1398297600,"04 24, 2014",2,-1

"Episode 16, ""Welcome to the tombs"", shows us how far this series has sunk, from what used to be hilarious, grisly, suspenseful, and original. Now we have the worst horror movie cliche, a ""heroine"" who will be fine if she just hurries up, but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets...eaten. We don't care about Andrea anyway, because Laurie Holden's trout pout is too hard to look at, and her character's predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity: she just can't see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath, even though it's obvious to everyone else. We, the audience, keep seeing things before she does, and then we're supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her! In this latest example, Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton, the Governor's jazzistant who is about to die and turn, and then will try to eat Andrea. Milton, still barely alive, urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself, so she can mercy kill him and escape, before the Governor returns with his strike force. There is every reason here for extreme speed. Death sits across the room from her and the Governor cannot be far behind. Never was it more important to keep one's mind on the task at hand (freeing oneself) and get the hell out of dodge. All Andrea has to do is hurry. But she indulges in long, tragic looks, tries to philosophize with Milton, forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions, and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive. So of course, Zombie Milton gets her. But there is no meaning to it, because she LET it happen! Then we have some more drawn out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die. Sad music, long stares, reverence. And we're supposed to see her as the ""Noble Soul who only wanted people to live"".

"I picked up this series as a huge fan of Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes.  I really liked the changes they made with a female Watson and a female Moriarty. I think his drug addiction was depicted a lot more severely than the the original, but I wrote that off as artistic license.The part that lost me has been the last season.  I appreciated this show because of the platonic relationship between Holmes and Watson. When they Introduced Mycroft, I had no real problem with him because he had no real part in the story, even though I thought the casting was TERRIBLE for Mycroft. They could have chosen someone far more appealing. Anyway, when they had the affair between Mycroft and Watson, I lost it. The ONE thing that made this show work was the TOTAL LACK of any kind of romantic or sexual relationships (between meaningful characters at least), and I found that it introduced dynamics into the show that are unsustainable. Already Watson is talking about moving out of the Brownstone, (something that never happened in the original Sherlock books). And now again is the initiation of a real relationship between her and Mycroft.  The endpoint of either one of these possibilities is dissolution of the partnership, which I believe is the one constant in any form of the Sherlock incarnations.Mad that they had to go and ruin one of the best series out there with really bad choices.",What happened?,1399680000,"05 10, 2014",2,-1
"Suspension of disbelief is a necessary element to enjoy any form of fiction, but this television show asks a bit too much.

Not all sci fi needs to be hard, by any means, but this show pushes the envelope a little too far.  We have internet, now.

"HAUNTED HIGHWAY (Prod. Jack Osbourne) is laughable. When they first hyped this show  when was that, 2011?  I expected an honest to goodness travel documentary of investigative journalism. Something which, as we all know, does not exist in paranormal shows or else they'd cease to be paranormal.Lately this show has been starring only Devin Marble and Jael De Pardo, both notoriously awful B movie bit players (Jack had to go off the show for a while due to an MS diagnosis). While Devin is something of a producer as well as an ""actor"", both of these clods were so much more fun when they were doing FACT OR FAKED. That was a show I liked because they made strenuous efforts to debunk everything.HAUNTED HIGHWAY is the reverse. Osbourne, or whoever conceived of this smelly gym sock, was clearly not serious about anything at all. It always, and I mean ALWAYS, has the air of a cruddy C list horror flick made in someone's backyard. In fact it often looks as if they are shooting in a backyard in California. And as I said, since the show has been reduced lately to Devin and Jael, well, the horrifically bad acting and scripted ""investigations"" get funnier and worse with each minute.If I have to see Devin fall on his butt into the water one more time, or hear Jael's blood curdling (totally phony) screams at every little creak, I'm going to stop watching this altogether. Come on, people! There are real intrigues and locations to be checked out, we don't need these two zombies who think they have creds because they did FACT OR FAKED for a couple of years.However, I would like to take the opportunity to wish Jack Osbourne a good health future. MS is a nasty bugger, which I know from my own experience. All the more reason for Osbourne to get serious if he wants to produce an outstanding, quality show. HIGHWAY is worse than any other show I can imagine.  SOAPBOX TIME  What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are ""reality""  in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. It is very simple.Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it and they were not trying to deceive their audiences. Even then, I recall it caused a national stink in both cases, and both those great men were in a little hot water for a time. Perkins then Cousteau invented and perfected the reality documentary show genre. Pity they did not invent the ""ghost hunter"" genre; it would have made the standard much higher.The true problem is, we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside  has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.That disclaimer has words to the effect that the shows are ""for entertainment purposes only"", and as if that weren't weighty enough, there also has to be some disclaimer that the shows are faked, partially faked, or partly reenacted as applicable. To what purpose goes such a law, you ask?  to let us know what has been faked and what is real, and NO, you can't say fakery is part of reality so it is ""real"" too. That stupid straw man argument has been used for over 20 years and I'm ashamed of anyone who says such a thing.For an excellent example of the right way to avoid fraud accusations, see the disclaimer on Ernie ""Turtleman"" Brown's excellent show,Call of the Wildman: Season 1  see my reviews. I can't recall it verbatim but it states pretty clearly that parts of the show were recreated reenacted for dramatic purposes.Honestly, why haven't these networks or at least the producers been brought to heel for this major offense?!","This show explains why we use the term ""cheesy""--which we SHOULDN'T if it's reality TV!",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",2,-1

Never fear, though; they found another mine coincidentally that's even bigger and scarier than the first. But will the execs sign off on it? Probably. This is why MGM sacked good quality shows like Stargate SG 1 and Stargate Atlantis for low budget garbage like this. Also, if you're going to be a ghost hunter, stop screaming every time you see a shadow person or hear a voice. If you're going to be doing this for a living, grow a backbone fer goodness sake!

Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu Ray, and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama, the acting and the writing seems as good as last season, but the picture quality is so poor I'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two.

The writer's don't do much of anything interesting with this idea.The characters are also poorly developed. The dialogue is mediocre at best. Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks.  There is a fair amount of that in this series.I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought. But after wading through four episodes, I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes.

"Throughout all of filmdom, there's some debate about when the cop buddy film actually came about.  Most critics seem to accept that the contemporary version of it was a product of 1970's and 1980's filmmaking, and I figure that's probably more right than wrong.  If the buddy film didn't originate somewhere in those two eras, it certainly made its most significant step forward culturally during that time.  That said, JAVA HEAT feels more like the outcome of someone trying to recapture that dynamic for an all new generation of movie goers.  While some may find that admirable, I'd just rather go back and re watch all the great buddy films of the past than have to sit through an inferior retread any day of the week.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Jake Wilde (played with `beginner's luck' by TWILIGHT's Kellan Lutz) is a teacher's jazzistant who finds himself in the most unlikely set of circumstances one could imagine: he survived a terrorist's bombing in Indonesia and is how having to be a witness for local detective Hashim (Ario Bayu).  But Jake's problem isn't the attack; rather, it's that he's not who he says he is, and the two men will have to join forces in order to stop a terrorist named Malik (Mickey Rourke) from absconding with `the Crown Jewels' and a beautiful sultan princess he intends to sell into sexual slavery!And therein lies the chief problem behind so very much of JAVA HEAT: its patchwork story.  None of these characters   not Jake, not Hashim, and not Malik   are every clearly defined so that an audience can either understand much less identify with them.  First, Jake's a teaching jazzistant; then he's some international FBI terrorism expert; then he's some AWOL military policeman.  As best as I can honestly tell you, his last identity is the only one that sticks; it's finally made perfectly clear in the film's closing sequence, but, by that point, should I or anyone really care?Stylistically, it's hard figuring out what to make of JAVA HEAT.  Its performances are stereotypical and predictable; its action pieces have all been done before; and its message of East triumphing over West appears as if it can only happen these days in similar cinematic fairy tales.  Its story is all over the map in terms of indicting the global society on behalf of the Indonesian people, and that's probably just what writer director Conor Allyn intended: convince everyone that anyone but the Muslims are to blame for the shape our world is in, and you've done not only a good thing but also the right thing.  Has he and his co writer Rob Allyn never heard about Sharia Law?  Oh, pardon me for perhaps stating the obvious because anyone with half a heart and a motion picture production crew knows better.Unfortunately, so much of JAVA plays out like a bad cup of coffee.  What little story there is makes no sense, and I have to wonder how much of this was actually left on the cutting room floor.  I say that because there's a scene about thirty minutes in wherein Lutz's character says to Bayu's character, ""Hey, didn't we do great teamwork back there?""  (I'm paraphrasing.)  He's also given his Indonesian counterpart the nickname of `Hash' (short for Hashim).  The chief problem with this sequence is that we've yet to see these two actually work together in any way, shape, or form.  Clearly, something has been either removed to give this exchange its meaning or something went completely unfilmed; and a competent filmmaker and or editor would've noticed the obvious storytelling gaffe and actually done something to fix it so that the narrative made sense.  It doesn't, and I spent the rest of the film realizing that this may've been by design as the script feels like a visual stew: it's all chocked full with scenes, plots, and characters excised from vastly superior films.Methinks the filmmakers hope the audience isn't watching too closely; that way, they're much more likely to enjoy JAVA HEAT.  They'll be stupefied to the action, or the young ladies will be suffering the vapors from seeing Lutz's naked body.  Me?  I just wanted it to, at some point, start to make some narrative sense.  Instead, it ends up feeling about 104 minutes way too long.JAVA HEAT is produced by Margate House Films and Margate House (???) along with some participation by IM Global and Zero Gravity Management.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group and IFC Films.  As for the technical specifications, the film looks and sounds pretty solid, though there's a measure loss of audio quality in a few scenes (not a huge distraction).  Also, the film played as an ""Official Selection"" of the Dallas International and Taormina Film Festivals.  As is often the case with these smaller releases, there are no major special features to speak of save a short `making of' featurette and the theatrical trailer.MILDLY RECOMMENDED.  Despite a lack of effort, JAVA HEAT isn't entirely a complete waste.  Granted, that may not be saying much, but it's the truth.  Stylistically, it's a throwback to a time when action films were a bit kinder and gentler.  I've no doubt it'll impress audiences who don't look too closely; my problem may very well be that I do look closely, especially when it comes to storytelling.  Still, this is a Hollywood wet dream: the bad guys are the Americans, the French, and the Chinese, while those Sharia lovin' Muslims are all just misunderstood by the rest of the world.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at IFC Films provided me with a DVD copy of JAVA HEAT by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Uneven JAVA HEAT Tastes Like A Bad Cup of Coffee,1379808000,"09 22, 2013",2,-1
"VANISHING ON 7TH STREET is a dark, dreary look at what transpires after an enigmatic catastophic event that has unexplicably resulted in the vanishing of all forms of life  and not just on 7th street.As expected, there are five survivors:  a young TV anchorman, a distraught mother, a teenage boy whose vanished mom runs the cafe where most of the action occurs, a lonely movie projectionist and a mysterious little girl.  And lots of menacing shadows and whispering voices.  Early on, we're given hints of the lost colony of Roanoke; ""dark matter"" and the approach of a strange storm.  Are any of these responsible for the vanishing?  We don't really find out  that lack of resolution annoys me  I'd like SOME kind of resolution.Director Brad Anderson (THE MACHINIST, SESSION 9) evinces some minor atmospheric chills but not much true terror.  The cast is adequate:  Hayden Christensen is a stalwart hero; Thandie Newton is strong as the mother; Jacob Latimore is a fresh change from the usual badjazz streetwise teen, but John Leguizamo's surprisingly good in his low level performance.

"I just discovered this little gem. I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now, however, I had not taken the time to watch. Today, I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw. I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven (though not to deep) type of show. The stories are simple yet realistically believable. There is a certain continuity as well. The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father. I won't go into details of the story lines, however, I will say this show is worth the time, if not the money. However, not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer. There are only 12   13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season. It's the same with all of their shows. The shows are great, but the price is ridiculous. That is not to say that I won't purchase the sets, just not at this price. I will wait for a sale or get them used. I refuse to pay more than $10   $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales.

"This is one ""horror"" that fails to deliver on all counts.  While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars, unfortunately it never improves.  The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus, completely destroys all potential this movie had.  I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but, again, it never comes.  Basically other than the surprise ending, the Innkeepers disappoints.It's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history.  She apparently works there at night.  A computer obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter... I guess.  He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy.  He's more like an arrogant know it all that never wins me over that's for sure, whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night.  The other characters that occasionally enter the picture (such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted, so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms.  Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs.  However, the problem is that (despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course) on several occasions, Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here, and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me  the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars.  If you're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie, you're going to fail miserably.  Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes isn't the least bit frightening either.  The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least.  Unfortunately by that point, you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring, plotless nonsense so overall it really is a dud of a film.  Avoid.",don't check inn,1360800000,"02 14, 2013",2,-1

"""Meeting Evil"" is a movie of stupefying logic, inept writing, willful unpleasantry and a couple of good actors who are cashing checks and hoping no one sees them. To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn. This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies (Collateral, Kalifornia, Cape Fear, Jackson's own Lakeview Terrace), so surprises aren't exactly in store, the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people, they don't even bear any resemblance to movie characters; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime, and it is for no discernible reason. Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself, but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply. This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained, perhaps have never seen a better movie, or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.The plot has timed, mild mannered real estate agent John (Luke Wilson) having a real sad sack of a day, he lost his job, his mortgage is in foreclosure, he has a stack of bills that read ""past due"", and he fights with his wife (Leslie Bibb) for no particular reason. Then Richie (Samuel L. Jackson) enters his life, at first unjazzuming, but soon he reveals his very dark nature. Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree, a dozen in under an hour from my calculations, and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride. Richie's motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him, or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him. Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities, of course it all ends at John's house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.The film tries to work on a more psychological level, I guess, but it totally fails. The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character, it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil, possibly even the devil himself, but he is actually just a remorseless killer, or is he. The film leads to a dubious denouement, followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti climax. This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study, but it has no characters to study.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation, but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut, he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen (The Cleaner, Unthinkable, Arena) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks. Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character, something else he has been doing a lot of lately, after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch. Luke Wilson doesn't fare much better, in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite, tedious material. But some of the supporting work is much worst, I suspect some of these ""actors"" were just friends, relatives, or investors. Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police, embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran, and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.Directed by Chris Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors), I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb, I soon discovered why I did not know him. Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct to dvd potboilers, titles like ""S. Darko"", ""Street Kings 2: Motor City"", ""Dirty"", ""Nightstsalker"", ""Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders"". ""Meeting Evil"" is Fisher's first theatrical film, well sort of, you see it's premiering on cable satelite TV and then video on demand, before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters. I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face, but they shouldn't have bothered, his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.I know, I know  if you can't say anything nice, ...just one more thing, please. Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography, provided by Marvin V. Rush, a close collaborator on some of Fisher's previously mentioned glories. Even at roughly ninety minutes ""Meeting Evil"" truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture.

"Oh no, ""Ancient Aliens"" again. The *fifth* season?! How many silly seasons can there possibly be? And all the true believer reviewers again! ""Lots of cool facts"". Geezus. Good people, there are arguably *no* true facts in this series *at all*.True to form, I've only watched one episode, ""The Von Daniken Legacy"". I admit that I hate Erich von D&auml;niken. His ideas or ""question marks"" about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times (in pyramid like UFOs, to boot) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned. Homeopathy and reductionist materialism, come back, all is forgiven! D&auml;niken's ""theories"" are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style, with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar owner spewing ""common sense"", that they almost make me weep! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury. OK, I was only eleven at the time, but hell, I'm a perfectionist.And yes, I need to chill and have a candy bar, I know...OK, I'm back. Has ""Ancient Aliens"" become any better during my coffee break? Well...no. So here goes!I'm not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims (avid readers of my reviews, all two of them, may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and...ahem...John Michael Greer), but D&auml;niken's speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated. D&auml;niken, a romantic adventurer of the cljazzical kind, has no formal training in archaeology, anthropology or comparative mythology I'm aware of. Yet, he goes around the world, see mysterious stone structures, declare them ""impossible"" and...voil&aacute;, this proves that aliens built them! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared ""impossible"", when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren't* impossible at all   I mean, they are there, aren't they, and they are made out of sandstone, not moon rock. That the local Natives can't build them, and point to the sky as explanation for who did, leads D&auml;niken to conclude that...well, aliens did it. It's all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico, debunked at least 10,000+ times, but still going strong. If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination, the lid of Pakal's tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket. If looked at vertically, using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography, the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed. But no, D&auml;niken's folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it's precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken's appeal. D&auml;niken is our ""audience substitute"". While everything you read in peer reviewed journals isn't necessarily true, there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training, not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer ""impossibility"" of it all. There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu, too, one D&auml;niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary. D&auml;niken says he hasn't formed a new religion. In a purely formal sense, he is right. He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism, in which the gods are explained away in ""naturalist"" fashion as space travellers in nuts and bolts craft. What D&auml;niken doesn't want to see, but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago, is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion. At the very least, D&auml;niken is offering the mjazzes a potent substitute for religion. The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with. As for D&auml;niken himself, he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day! Thus, he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion. I don't think Taoists, Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits ""the return of the gods""...Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how ""ancient aliens"" can be turned into a religion (a religion which claims to be materialist, in fact). In their case, the quasi Biblical traits are very obvious. Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D&auml;niken's. And D&auml;niken himself? Isn't he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed, its Aaron so to speak? If you take the bait, I'm sure more ""esoteric"" people are waiting in the wings. I've heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society, which started as a D&auml;nikenite fan club, ended up as a New Age group. Thus, paradoxically the appeal of D&auml;niken's message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti science and elitist ""hidden knowledge"", both modern irreligion and post modern religion. An interesting object for a comparative religion study, I'm sure! These people don't understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope...The religious Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the (easily spotted) contradictions in D&auml;niken's books. How can aliens (that's *aliens*, for heaven's sake!) breed true with humans? If they can, why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool? (Albert Einstein doesn't count.) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku, if they have super advanced technology light years ahead of us? Why aren't there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India, if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens? D&auml;niken's supporters point to ""mysteriously"" charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A bombs, making you wonder why the bombs didn't obliterate the whole town, rather than just charring its walls...Seriously, should I continue?Are there real, unsolved mysteries in the universe? Oh, definitely. You already know which ones: where do we come from, why are we here, where are we going... And why *this* fun house of a planet? I'm willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism, the existence of Spirit, even one or two paranormal phenomena (although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel). But literal, flesh and blood (or green jelly) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses, breeding true with female ape men, and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement (and ours?)...naaaah. It's bad archaeology, bad anthropology, bad comparative religion, and   when push comes to shove   probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D&auml;niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose.

"The opening to &#34;Adult World&#34; is enough to let you know what you're in for as you witness Amy attempt to commit suicide by sticking her head in the oven and putting a plastic bag over her head. After getting a job at Adult World, Amy's boss is a very down to earth guy named Alex (Evan Peters) who may work at an adult video store, but has no issue with that whatsoever and he doesn't let that affect his other interests. It's through Alex and Adult World that Amy meets a drag queen named Rubia (Armando Riesco) and even though they get off on the wrong foot they eventually become really good friends.Unfortunately Amy is blinded by selfishness and obsessed with a pessimistic hack. Amy makes a series of poor decisions to try and follow her dream of becoming a poet. She makes childish mistakes, but then becomes upset when someone calls her a child. She's irritating, has a nerve grating voice, is naive, and extremely pompous as she seems to look down on everyone around her. Alex at least seems normal even though he works in what some would consider an uncomfortable environment, but the most interesting character is Rubia. The character really doesn't do much other than smoke pot, ride a stolen bicycle, and give other women makeovers, but Rubia never pretends to be anything that she isn't. Amy asks Rubia in one scene if she has ever felt invisible. Rubia's face distorts as she says, &#34;Not really.&#34; It's as if Rubia has all the attention she's ever wanted while Amy continues to search for the big break she's always craved.If you can persevere through Amy's temper tantrums and John Cusack acting like he has no interest in being in &#34;Adult World,&#34; then there actually is something really positive and inspirational lying under layers within the film. Like &#34;Inside Llewyn Davis,&#34; &#34;Adult World&#34; seems to speak to you if you've ever felt like a struggling artist. Along the way, Amy learns that it's not just about making a name for yourself, getting rich, or becoming famous. You can't make a carbon copy of the path your idol took or follow in anyone else's footsteps. Sometimes you have to take your own path and create your art just for you.&#34;Adult World&#34; has this really exceptional message wrapped up in this unbelievably obnoxious package that almost makes the entire experience unbearable. It's like a really disgusting bag of garbage filled with rotting produce and decomposing meats; the type of garbage that creates that dirty, brown trash juice you always find bleeding out of dumpsters. Yet in the middle of that bag is something worthwhile like a forgotten treasure map or one of your favorite comic books magically still in mint condition. &#34;Adult World&#34; may have meaning, but you have to trudge through waist deep piles of unfiltered, prepubescent, overdramatic whimpering just to get to it.",A morally satisfying message trapped in a garbage burrito,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",2,-1

"(SPOILERS) Feel as if I've seen a variation of this character so many times in film, super rich, caucasian, male, and still do not understand him...perhaps I never will.  Loved the actors, but the story...nothing new, why tell it.  Not to rag on the filmmakers, in the commentary the gentleman explained it took him forever to be allowed to direct.  But why this story.  Does every well off male character of a certain age have to have a mistress 20 30 years his junior and be a scum bag (lying to wife, cheating investors), ugh.  Such an unflattering picture.  I still do not understand what made him tick.  Maybe I'd need to be male to understand what drives him; as a woman, I'm sorry to say, he makes no sense to me (I may just be too slow, honestly).  Basically, in my opinion, the character in this film is presented as a successful, powerful businessman, but it is also clearly shown in the story that he is a criminal just smart enough to manipulate the system (legal system, capitalist system), to stay a step ahead of the authorities.  How is living your life a lie equal to success.  To me, the character was a liar, a cheat, and a criminal; and as he chose to live his life the way he did, he seems stupid, not smart.  But almost all the characters surrounding him either ignore his shortcomings (his wife), or maybe most just don't see them.  His daughter seemed shocked by his revelation of criminal activity, as if she knew nothing about him   it's not believable that the characters closest to him would know so little about him   he's not suddenly behaving this way, he's been behaving this way for a long time.  How could his adult children not have a clue to who he is.  He's not a flawless liar   I think his kids were underwritten.  Had the writer director presented the character in a way I could understand, I would give the movie 3 stars, but I am still as confused about this type of fictitious businessman as I've always been, so I gained no clarity from the film.  Also disliked the women characters; the wife character (played by Susan Sarandon, a great actress) displayed no power until the surprise ending, so her sudden power at the end is not set up properly; and I'm so tired of seeing stupid women characters as mistresses to some dog who strings them along   can't we have a gorgeous mistress dump some jerk and go to school to get her masters degree or Ph.D; and the daughter had no power in the story, just a title.  Basically the Richard Gere character disrespected all the women   how is that attractive to any woman viewer.  Anyway, disliked the character Mr. Gere played (liked his acting, of course), and just wanted more from the women characters.  Hope the writer director will try again and do better.  Regarding the use of the N word in the story, as a middle age African American woman, it indicates to me how disrespectful the film business treats minorities with less financial power   the film business has a lot of powerful Jewish people, I very rarely hear Jewish racial slurs in the movies I see, but I often hear the N word   racial slurs shouldn't be in film stories unless they are sprinkled throughout for all the races, which they never are.  Just a thought to the film maker for future projects.  Maybe he'll think about it.  For instance, whatever his ethnicity is, how would he feel viewing films that lobbed racial insults at his group, at his ancestors.  There are alot of different people in an audience   not just the people financing films, all races view them.  I think we need to move abit closer to the concept of world film, i.e., respecting all life and thinking long and hard before inserting insulting racial slurs in film.

"Mark Pellington's Sundance disaster, titled 'I Melt With You', is one of the strangest, incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year. There are pros and cons   more of the latter than the former   and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits. With that being said, it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is, but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties. Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream, and as a result, they have taken questionable paths in life. Over the course of a drug filled week, the men reminisce on the past, proceed to wax philosophical on the present, listen to the music of their youth, party with girls, drink obscene amounts of hard liquor, snort mountains of coke, and pop every pill known to mankind. Between this foursome, moments of sobriety are extremely rare   the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill' meets 'Scarface' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men, racked with guilt over the death of his lover, commits suicide   a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago, which all of them, save for one, managed to forget. You read that correctly. Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion, these boys made a binding promise to one another   a contract, signed in blood. When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails, it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape. It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse, and as a result, becomes more than a bit preposterous. The cast includes Thomas Jane, Jeremy Piven, Rob Lowe, and Christian McKay. The performances are hit (Christian McKay) and miss (just about everyone else, especially Thomas Jane).The first half of the film is pretty decent, and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly. What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R, 122 minutes, directed by Mark Pellington, released by Magnolia Pictures.

"08 28 2013 UPDATE  last night's episode was yet more proof that this show is really just derailed. According to the newest installment, it makes perfect sense that Auggie was actually a CIA operative FIRST in 2006, THEN joined the military, where he was blinded in 2007, and then went back to the CIA. Yeahhhhh, that's definitely a totally believable career progression. I mean, at this rate, the details of this season border on sci fi. And Piper Perabo's acting is getting more and more stilted, making you think that she's planning her own exit or bored to tears with the script. RIDICULOUS.=============================================================================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been watching this show from the beginning, and was already a little apprehensive about the somewhat predictably lame season 3 ending of Auggie and Annie falling into bed together (SNORE!). But I was completely unprepared for just how BAD this season would be. Not only does their relationship take center stage   right along with little inserts of the crumpled, limping relationship between Arthur and Joan who, surprise surprise, TV once again manages to produce a miracle and makes her pregnant at whatever age she's supposed to be (the actress herself being 43).I'm not sure what's worse in the show so far: the incredibly AWFUL, bad, awkward relationship between Auggie and Annie   replete with some of the worst cliches and stale lines you remember from bad 70s and 80s movies   that's so embarrjazzingly bad that you're variously wondering how the acting in a show can get WORSE with continuing seasons whent the actors should now be firmly entrenched in their characters, or think that it's as awkward as watching a real life brother sister team fake a romantic relationship (yuck). Yes, it's THAT bad.And while there are the occasional moments when the show briefly returns to its former gusto, the thrills and suspense of previous seasons are few and far between. Mostly you witness Piper Perabo acting like she just got off the bus in Hollywood yesterday (and, let's face it, she's come a long way since Coyote Ugly)   and one can only hope that real spies have better skills than her because when you see scenes where she strolls around like Bambi, blissfully unaware of all the DANGERS!! around her, always waiting for some guy to rescue her...it's so groan worthy that you just want to throw a well heeled shoe at the tv and yell MAKE THEM STOP!All of those things just seem to be distractions from a lack of well written storylines that initially drew me   and presumably others   to this show, which now stumbles clumsily from one eye roll inducing scene to the next.The show seems to have become a really tragic hybrid between a bad episode of Law & Order and a day time soap   if it wasn't for the fact that I've got cable and the other shows I enjoy watching are on hiatus until the fall, I wouldn't be giving this the time of day at all anymore.

"This could have been a great show. But its not. What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small town America. They get to be ""bad"" guys, but bad guys within real strict limits. Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs. To undermine the premise even further they create real ""bad guys"" in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the ""good"" Bikers can't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos. We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money. Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something. He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang. But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire. The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works. Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they witch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey. When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble. But in Sons of Anarchy, Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk, it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters. There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this. And there were some things that I did really like. But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy.","wanted to like it, but can't",1254268800,"09 30, 2009",2,-1

This film is so clique, stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre.

There are only a couple guests, giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate. The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you, which most of the time aren't what you expect them to be. There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future, but if that isn't bad enough, there is of course the investigations themselves. Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder, they go looking for EVPs, using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters.

"(Warning, this review contains some spoilers)I thought the first would help the producers realize their mistakes and improve on them. Fat chance.The initial shot has people raving about Grave Encounters and going loco about how good or bad it was and how some were convinced it really was real. One such raving fan goes to an alcohol steeped party and (eventually) reveals that he's a @#%^#@$ visionary. My thought on that was ""Sure you're a visionary. I don't get your vision, though.""His plan is to provide evidence that Grave Encounters was the true deal. Problem is... his obsession with the ""proof"" leads to problems with his girlfriend, friends, and, really, his whole life situation it seems. Between his own filmmaking (you're given snippets of his film, which is nothing but predictable shot after predictable shot) and finding what he needs, he's really letting himself loose on his psychosis.Just like in the first film, this goes to show you NEED to know how to make your ghost effects realistic. There was one singular shot where a creepy ghost did send chills down my spine. Then the ghost moved. End of the fear and the beginning of my eyes rolling.If there's anything I can say this movie did that did get my interest, it was the use of multiple types of cameras (iPhone, professional camera, B W silent era camera, etc.) to tell the story from different types of angles and get a sense of realism.The other was the return of a certain character from the first movie. Out of all the actors in this movie, his was hands down the most believable. Pure craziness, from the shocking reveal to his last moment.Unfortunately, afterwards, it's all hedonism at its most horrorific. And it quickly got as disinteresting, bland, 1 dimensional, lackluster boring as it had been. Even when a cleaning lady is pjazzing by the ghost hunting team, I'm quite certain the team didn't notice the look she gave them, which tipped off that something was going to happen. Before the elevator doors opened, I (unfortunately again) could predict what would happen. It defied physics, but it couldn't defy predictability?

They had the man behind the stuff, the judge saw things that showed he did it, then she said she couldn't use it in cort because the lawyer acted as law.  Freaking crazy right?

"Once upon a time, Francis Ford Coppola made movies like ""The Godfather"" and ""Apocalypse Now."" He also made ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" but that doesn't eclipse his accomplishments.But Francis Ford Coppola clearly has entered the ""I'm going to do whatever I want, even if it makes no sense"" phase in his career.

But I'll try to tackle it anyway: Second string horror author Hall Baltimore (Val Kilmer) is touring for his latest novel, and ends up in a small town that doesn't even have a bookstore. That evening, he encounters a strange, ghostly young girl who calls herself ""V"" (Elle Fanning).He soon finds that strange things are afoot in this town    time seems to be frozen (none of the clock faces move), there is a gang of bikers who may be vampires camped out on the lakeshore, and the ghost of Edgar Allen Poe visits him in his dreams to reveal half forgotten secrets. And what does all this have to do with the recently murdered girl lying in the police station?It's really hard to even pjazz judgement on ""Twixt""    it would involve understanding what the director was trying to do... or thinking... or understanding ANYTHING. It feels like Coppola had four or five different ideas for stories (""Vampire bikers! A vampire ghost orphan! Dream messages from Poe! A failing author with personal issues!""), and so he squashes all of them into one movie.The result feels like a mad hybrid of Stephen King and David Lynch. The small town setting, the supernatural threats and the eccentric characters feel somewhat like something King would put in a story... but the way it's presented is wildly Lynchian, with giant lumps of misty symbolism and blurred borders between fantasy and reality. You could watch this movie a dozen times, and still not be sure what is happening.For instance, one scene features Baltimore wandering into a blue lit bar, where he listens to two people who speak in an affected, dreamlike way and occasionally sings ""The Big Rock Candy Mountain."" After one of them attacks V, they babble some more about how the clocks do not work and time cannot be measured... and Baltimore just leaves. Utterly baffling... and no, it is never referred to again.I suspect that Val Kilmer was just as baffled, because that's effectively the performance he gives    total confusion. He does a decent job with Baltimore's frustration and grief over the problems in his life, but most of the time he's left staring around in confusion. Elle Fanning isn't in much of the movie, but she does do a good job as a girl who may be a ghost, a vampire, a dream, or whatever.But one thing that Coppola does not fail at is making the movie beautiful    it's a misty, night hued story that drifts over lakes, through ruined stone walls, through moonlight dappled forests. Some of the greenscreen is a bit obvious, but it doesn't distract from the hauntingly lovely, surreal visuals that fill most of the movie.Francis Ford Coppola has become the elderly winemaking version of people who make amateur horror shorts and put them up on youtube. ""Twixt"" is utterly baffling and bizarre, but at least it's a pretty kind of baffling bizarre.",Twixt confusion and weirdness,1376956800,"08 20, 2013",2,-1
"Folks, there are no aliens. *Nobody* saw any aliens before the 1930's. I believe Guy Ballard on Mount Shasta was the first. Why the 1930's? Why in the United States? Because of SCYFY PULP MAGAZINES, that's why. Sure, people have seen strange stuff since time immemorial, but nobody specifically saw ""aliens"" until the 1930's.Why don't the aliens tell us anything terribly important which we don't already know? When people were afraid of a thermonuclear war, the aliens warned us about...surprise...the perils of the A bomb. Thank you. When people began to worry about environmental destruction, the aliens started to sound like Al Gore. When Barack Obama was president, a particular alien faction revealed that *he* (Obama) was an alien. Yet, during the primary elections, when Obama was just one of several candidates, the aliens were silent...And, good people, if the aliens are so darn sophisticated, WHY DO THEIR SAUCERS ALWAYS CRASH? HA HA HA.But OK, I admit that none of the above definitely *disproves* the existence of 57 breeds of aliens, visiting Terra for no better reason than mutilate some cows, drop a Bigfoot off in Pennsylvania, or make a fool out of Jimmy Carter.

"I love the Terminator Series. And it is FUN to have a bit more of the story to think about and enjoy.  However, there is so little story, and so much video game action, that you really can never stop thinking that you are in a video game, and not ""watching a movie with a story and a plot.""  To be clear, this is NOT a video game. It is a fan fiction type of story that was made with animation software that you would see in video gaming software. Everything caries that jerky animation quality common to older video games. Still, this is an actual story of several chapters and it is fun in the respect that you are engaged once again in the Terminator Saga.I would give it a C  for a grade for the story. :(  Slow, boring in places... and it is hard to do that with an action film.

"I was excited to see something new from Chris Carter and immediately watched this pilot.  It started out relatively interesting, even looking past the clich&eacute; everyone's trapped in an elevator plot device, particularly the added clich&eacute; of including one of each possible personality type and demographic.Worse yet, the old age make up they applied to the younger actress playing Francis (the elderly female character) is terrible.As for plot, character development, and overall storytelling, I was underwhelmed.  Practically nothing of worth happens in the entire episode.(Itsy bitsy spoilers ahead)The show opens with our rag tag group of people trapped in the aforementioned elevator, then trapped in a parking garage before they finally make it out due to some cringe worthy plot devices (the self proclaimed innocent fugitive comes back for everyone despite having held them all at gunpoint only an hour earlier.The riot we see over the ambulance they've commandeered is ridiculous, but what's more ridiculous is the fact that they expect us to believe that although the unruly mob was rage filled enough to nearly tip the vehicle on their way out, they did nothing as it made its way in?  What??Let's move on.  Things happen, revelations occur, heavy handed Biblical references emerge, stereotypical thugs cause trouble, a French woman cries, and Chris Carter shows us all how terrible he is at directing when he's out of practice.This episode was directed as if an art student was behind the camera.  One with a C grade average.  The cuts are odd and abrupt, the shots are awkward, the attempts to mask low budget's limitations with camera trickery get lazier and lazier.  The ending of the episode (which I won't share) feels forced.  Like Chris was writing the episode and thought, ""Oh s***...nothing's happened and it's still not interesting.  I'd better throw in something really effing weird.""  And that's just what he did.Perhaps the story will pan out in the long run, but I have lost interest in seeing the next chapter.

"This show represents nepotism carried to utterly ridiculous extremes, tediously characterized by the aggravatingly obligatory &#34;family dinners&#34;, headed by Tom Selleck whose face seems permanently frozen in a perpetual scowl. In the long ago and far away, Selleck as Magnum P.I. was a great serio comic character, a persona he maintained, at least to some degree, in his later TV and film vehicles. With the Jesse Stone films, however, he began taking on a darker, heavier persona, although still effective and often funny. With Blue Bloods, though, his acting seems to have become wooden and much too predictable, his mouth a perfect reflection of his grim, down curling mustache. The twinkle of wit that once made him so likeable is completely gone. His rigid, moralizing righteousness and scarcely credible &#34;objectivity&#34; where his family members are concerned strains credulity.Donnie Wahlberg's character is, like Selleck's, mostly just gratingly irritating and seems interminably locked into a constant, growlingly foul mood. Will Estes, as the boyish cop in the family, is just that &#8212; absurdly boyish and barely believable. Worse, he's Wahlberg's &#34;kid brother&#34; as well as Selleck's youngest son. What is this, Family Affair in Blue? Having more than one member of a family be a part of the police force or justice system may not be too far fetched, but this is ridiculous. Even Len Carriou plays not only Selleck's father, but the former Police Commissioner and the supposed eminence grise at the invariable family dinners.The least believable part of this series is this very fact that everyone in the entire family either works directly for or is part of the same legal system as New York Police Commissioner Selleck, creating endless conflicts of interest that no justice system could or should ever tolerate. Only Bridget Moynihan's character is even slightly tangential to Selleck's authority, but they are all perpetually airing their professional problems at those exasperating family dinners where even the kids get to throw in their two cents worth of wisdom and insight.

"So I thought that this show would resemble Gilmore Girls since the creator Amy Sherman Palladino had created that show lasting seven seasons, and that the grandmother form Gilmore Girls is a central character on this show. However, I was proven wrong, this show doesn't resemble Gilmore Girls at all, it's about a Vagas show girl who teaches dance in a small town. Granted I haven't finished the first season, but it wasn't that interesting and used plot twists early on like killing off a promising romantic partner for the main character. I guess that the network differences between this show and Gilmore Girls could affect the content, but I would hope not. Anyways as a fan of Amy Sheman Palladino I am disappointed with this show, however it could also be that I am not interested in ballerina's too.

"There is a great moment in this particular episode.There is a scene where one of the faux mountain men is working at his sawmill. They claim the sawmill is water powered. The whole premise of the show being that these ""mountain men"" are living a subsistance life in the hills by the old ways.Not only do they show that the generator is so small that it cannot possibly power the sawmill, they actually show the gasoline engine that does power the sawmill in the background. Its right there connected with belts to the sawmill.I know what reality television is. But when they give up the basics of even trying for a suspension of disbelief, its all just kind of sad.

"Universal Solider 1 set up that the army found a way to reanimate a corpse and control it. So they thought.

"We all learn eventually that life isn't always fair, nice guys don't always win, and brown nosing often has unfair rewards.  I can't decide what kind of disorder this woman has, besides extreme narcissism, but something is very wrong. My best guess is that she got bullied in school, never asked to the dance and now thinks it's her turn, as an adult, to hurt the moms she belittles out of envy she has no husband and kids to go home to, no gal pals she doesn't have to terrorize bribe into hanging out with, no little black dresses to work enough magic on her with. I'm not trying to be mean nobody has it all. Just, why hate on innocent kids of moms she is jealous of or just plain mad at? It's beyond pathetic or unprofessional   it's sick. You just don't treat people this way especially little kids.Interesting that Abby called Payton out  who surely was a big bully so early on, while being literally the biggest meanest bully ever! Who can forget her bawling openly instead of ""saving her tears for her pillow"" as she so cruelly yelled at virtually every child there to do at various times when Maddie  *gasp* brewed up, then screaming, when called out on it ""oh well, some kids are just special!"" No, Abby, ALL of those kids are special, and if you weren't so focused on one kid, you couldn't help but see that!  Then, on this latest episode we hear Maddie turn from what once seemed like a nice person into a little snot her response to a TEAMMATE's being legitimately upset over something that would have thrown HER (the sorest loser on the team) into ""the vapours"" was to cynically spit out "" it's two minutes in life she just needs to get over it."" No matter how often she wins, that is behavior of a loser. Neither Melissa nor Abby are doing her any favors. She is going to grow up thinking she's just a little bit better than the rest of us. Life has a way of sending us lessons about ego and such, when we need them. And not so many friends. Maddie is in for a rough time when those lessons start coming and she sees what divatude attracts and doesn't.  She is a child at this point she still has that time excuse but, unfortunately, a few key very poor role models.Just imagine what the otherlifers Brooke, Paige, Nia, and Chloe  could be and do with equal love and attention? They are absolutely wonderful despite the bullying and the uneven playing field while managing to be nice little girls who don't think they are better or make snarky comments I just wish they could manage to not OWN Abby's words quite so much. Living well is the best revenge, and they all have the talent to draw themselves up and show Abby out of spite if nothing else Chloe has beaten the favorite before, and I'd love to see Maddie up against any of the others in Hip Hop, Paige especially. Ironically,,they are the product Miss Abby created, and they deserve and could be so much more. It was egregious to pit the two duets  TEAMMATES against one another, and if the blondes had had the confidence they should have , they could have come out on top, particularly if they had gotten the encouragement and rehearsal time the Teammate competitors (who DOES that?) had been given. Seriously, not only is there more than one good dancer on the TEAM, for Abby to think that she had only produced one and that she genuinely needs a traveling side show to find other schools' talent to poach to build a winning team really is selling herself a bit short. She has had winning TEAMS  including THIS one  for years. To pimp herself out as dance 's version of Simon Cowell for a bit more fame attention...kind of speaks for itself, at that. Is she all about Going Hollywood or is she in the legitimate business of molding talented professional career driven dancers for the sake of the art that she poses as?I do know that if this is real, I wouldn't subject my child to either end of the Dance Dementia spectrum and I think being the pet would be the most damaging position of all, long term.Kendall is not a lifer, to her benefit but she is developing the same pained ""I just sat on the point of the top of the pyramid"" expression on her face while she dances that The Favorite always has. The fact that her mom has a habit of repeatedly lapsing into ""I"" or ""we"" as in ""I should have had that solo"" or ""we shouldn't be last on the pyramid"" is both telling and disturbing. Even her kid tells her to knock it off.. I'm always thinking of Nia, Paige, Brooke, and Chloe, who have been there languishing in obscurity since toddler hood every time Jill starts with what ""we"" deserve. Does the woman ever listen to herself?Ironically, Abby seems to be biting out of the same rotten Ohio Apple as her smarmy competitor  ignoring an opportunity to turn confidence, energy and deserved equal attention from the products of a lifelong devotion to her studio, despite the abuse, favortism, and neglect they're repeatedly subjected to instead, poaching from the fruits of competition studios' labor. As several savvy moms have repeatedly pointed out, is the irony of this completely lost on her? She has greater confidence in the products of other studios than in her own? What's next, strutting around wearing molting rat fur vests,  looking like a multi colored rat is loose on her head, calling everyone else's ""fashion"" tacky while Applepolishing purchased talent ""guest choreographers"", recruiting from utube and thinly veiled publicity sucking ""twittercalls""  oh wait, she's already doing most of that! Why not try being creative, developing from within her ranks to give the same attention, choreography, costumes, private lessons, interest and encouragement to all that she pours into the only one who truly reflects the results of her lifelong tutelage that she has deemed worthy? Let's see THEN what happens. I think, frankly, she's selling herself way too short, and I wish it was just her problem.This show used to be fun. Now, if it is real, it really crosses the line into abuse and, in either case, it stopped being fun to watch long ago. She is no longer a professional, she is out of control, mean, abusive, and needs to get over the whole big mouth big hair big fingernails and big ego, etc. a caricature every plus sized drag queen parade has undoubtedly added to their routine.But that's her problem. Unfortunately, I fear that all of these kids will need therapy. Abby needs to get first in line, and today's favoriteright behind her.She knows less about real cljazz than Cathy Apple does, and that's saying something.","Like a train wreck - hurts to watch, but morbid curiosity makes it hard to turn away.",1392249600,"02 13, 2014",1,-1

The execution doesn't work.  On a show or skit that IS working, a viewer can forget that this was on someone else's page, as the actor makes it his own.Like watching SNL, when some skits take off and others just lie there, good ideas gone wrong.The set up is fine.

"Interesting idea, not the first time that it's been tried before. I liked ""Commander in Chief,"" the short lived series about a woman president, better, because it didn't try so hard to play off real people. Sorry to be the lone dissenter, it seems, and this will undoubtedly sound trivial and sexist (and probably is), but:I was offended by the absurdly high and ugly waistbands they dressed Sigourney Weaver in to hide her thick middle aged waist. They didn't do that to the men with their middle aged paunches.It amazes me that whoever cast this thought anyone would think that Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is sexy enough to appeal to so many women (he's very unattractive, to me, and what's with that mouth downturned mouth that's apparently an affectation?) or that someone as attractive as Susan Berg, who played the reporter, would find whoever it was who played the editor she worked for attractive in the least (definitely not). And surely they could have found a lot of men to portray the character based on Bill Clinton better and something more substantive for the character to be than such a pathetic sex and power monger.Most of the plots were just silly, not developed, way too contrived.Sigourney Weaver was fine in the part and in her acting as Secretary of State and would be President.

They all shrugged their shoulders in a non committal fashion and started hacking out the script for ""THE AFTER"".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie hybrids (leaving out E for ""Ear Mites"", I for ""Indiana Jones Impersonators"", L for ""Leprechauns"", P for ""Preying Mantis"", R for ""Rascally Rabbits"", and W for ""Wascally Wabbits"", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies! A black prisoner innocently convicted, a white lawyer who's secretly corrupt, a vaguely hispanic female cop with everything to prove, a gay guy with a wacky day job, a slutty blond from someplace South ish, a rich jewish lady with a spanish housekeeper, and... this will shatter your religion... an IRISHMAN who drinks WAY too much! It's preposterous! Am I forgetting someone...? Oh, yeah, the security douche bag. I think there was a protagonist too here somewhere, but tacked on in a slap dash manner and thinly portrayed. Not worth further examination.That's called sarcasm.The featured characters are what Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter called ""Desperately Random"", which means NOT RANDOM AT ALL, but wishing to SEEM so. In THE AFTER's sense, it means that the characters are so oddly varied and or paradoxically foiled against one another that it makes one wonder if they used that same 20 sided die to determine what half of the characters would be from the list: ""Harry's Hackneyed Stereotypes to Avoid at All Costs!"", and the other half just trying to make some allegorical diatribe about how things should be in a perfect world we don't have (boo freaking hoo!). Every time the convict talked about black folk in jail I wanted to slap him.Foil: innocent black man sent to prison for a murder he didn't commit vs. slick, white lawyer breaking the law by soliciting a hooker in a public stairway.Foil: same innocent black man with the ""CAN DO!"" attitude vs. the pjazzive aggressive white spanish cop seeking to put him away, but ultimately, and utterly, ineffectual in any real sense. She was the ONLY authority figure in the ambulance and just caved like a jellyfish to the whim of the very guy she was sworn to capture. She would happily put away that innocent black man, but he's too busy delivering CANDY CANES and WHOOP BUTT to protect the group, and he's FRESH OUT OF CANDY CANES, baby!I think the events that not even the police or the crowds stumbling around oblivious even realized was going on (...Wait, WHAT?!?!?!..) was that someone farted on set, and it was just really, really bad, so they had hours and hours of footage trying to figure out who farted. Seriously. Watch the parts of the show where people are just wandering vaguely here and there, scared of nothing in particular, but refusing to go back to their ordinary lives, and just imagine someone off camera letting one rip. You will suddenly understand method acting.At one point, all the people are racing around with luggage like they all remembered they had planned a trip to Majorca that afternoon and they're all going to miss their flight.Keep in mind, all this time there is NO ACTUAL APOCALYPSE going on. There are NO ZOMBIES, or anything else ATTACKING ANYONE, NOTHING is BLOWING UP, STARTING on FIRE, SHOOTING PEOPLE or BEING SHOT at BY people, and yet the mob of pedestrians decide to attack the group as if the ""heroes"" were Bogarting the latest iPhone design! It would be like you hearing a boom, losing power in your work, going outside, and then losing your mind with no conception of why you were there, blundering about for 45 clueless minutes and THAT'S when you see a group of folk in an ambulance and you just have to tear them apart with your bare hands for no particular reason! Why in the heck doesn't anyone just go home or back to work?Perhaps that's the reason why there's the non apocalypse and suddenly a group that has no reason at all for hanging out together suddenly go all Scooby Doo Mystery Solvers Club despite their vast differences  or their secret sameness ess ess...? I don't even think the actors knew that the big screen quality of the first 95 POINTLESS percent of the movie was going to sprint right into a cheesy ""B"" production right at the end. That's the REAL twist. Surprise! There's NO MORE MONEY LEFT to shoot this show. We blew it renting a wedding mansion, the 200,000 stand ins, and these cameras. Good thing we didn't RENT the cameras, or they'd be going back, too.They really believed that if they just gave the group enough momentum that their pace alone would mop up any plot leaks, but it actually WAS the plot (or plot synthetic) sprinkled all too liberally with brief, shambling pauses for character development. There's NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! Get out of the elevator! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the parking garage! Now, let's talk about our feelings. Get out of the street! Let's hear about those feelings. Get back to your hotel room! Now, let's hash out our feelings. Get in the ambulance! Quick, feelings? Bust into the mansion! Consensus... feelings? Sprint into the forest! Let's see how we're feeling. Get fondled by a naked, tattooed contortionist in grey henna! Feelings anyone? Get in your time machine and warn yourself not to watch this show... awe, dang. Can't do that last one. Show's over. Maybe time travel will be in the next episode. I have a... feeling that it might (could be F&%$#&G; anything, really).*Spoiler   They landed on D for ""Demons from the Netherworld"", and guess what? Each character has the same birthday. Hmm. Not sure that matters in the history of ever. Oh, but they each have a tattoo like birth mark that together make some sick artwork on the back of the demon that stalks them for the last two minutes of the show so that it can give them shoulder mjazzages in the forest. So, the fact that the SCG (Stereotypical Character Gang) are all suddenly so chummy and comfortable around each other is because they are all secretly connected despite having been introduced in an entirely (muffled snickering) random way. I'm blowing your mind now. Sorry. (SHHH.. its not random at all... keep it a secret...)I cannot even imagine what randomly (hehe) generated cinematic gold we will stagger into aimlessly in the next episode!

"For the first few episodes, my wife and I were really enjoying it. Then, well, it dawned on us that the FBI was more stupid about things than we would have been, or any cops on any TV show we've ever seen would've been, or even Barney Fife would've been. They don't screen people to see who has visited the villain, which would sort of be an easy thing to do. It would give them a short list of suspects, wouldn't it?They have a never ending string of folks to serve the same purpose as the red shirts on away teams for the original Star Trek series. Hanging out with Ryan is certain death for any character you've never seen before. Bad guys show up everywhere. 90% of the people Ryan has ever spoken to seems to be a part of this cult... yet they won't just scour the prison visitor logs? Half of the law enforcement community seems to be in the cult. It didn't take long for this to get to be a bit silly.Finally, some members of the cult itself are portrayed as ""Constitutional Radicals"". There is a ""Don't Tread on Me"" flag on the wall of the cult's training camp. Seriously? This show is about people who love the US Constitution who happen to really like to kill people? Where did that come from? It's nonsense, and it is the straw that broke the camel's back for me.I love the acting and the casting is awesome. Too bad the writers haven't the brains to make the story credible and to keep their socialistic bias in check.","Great acting, but wrong agenda",1364947200,"04 3, 2013",2,-1
"All one need look at is the prevalence of Oprah Winfrey evolving into her own network (OWN, indeed!) to realize that women&#8217;s issue matter in the burgeoning world of pop culture.  And I say that as a man!  Women have their own unique struggles, they have their own unique baggage, much of which gets pjazzed down from generation to generation.  They cross that threshold from childhood to adulthood.  They bear children.  They send their boys and girls off to fight wars.  They experience their own hateful form of peer pressure from girl to girl that probably gives them nightmares on up in through menopause.Despite the fact that commercial advertising has told you that you&#8217;ve come a long way, baby, maybe we as a society haven&#8217;t gone far enough?  That&#8217;s some of what&#8217;s in the heart of SAVING GRACE B. JONES, a period piece tearjerker brought to you by living legend, Connie Stevens.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)For nearly 20 years, Grace (played by the incomparable Tatum O&#8217;Neal) has resided in the care of a state asylum for the insane.  Her brother, Landy (the reliable Michael Biehn), finally secures her release, and he&#8217;s bound and determined to bring her home to live with his wife, Bea (Penelope Ann Miller) and child.  However, secrets never die in Small Town America, and while the townfolks are more involved with stopping the mounting flood waters Grace won&#8217;t hold back her own dire emotions in this tale laced with jilted love and misplaced affection.The good?  I love seeing Michael Biehn in practically anything, and his turn as the small town baker here is pretty solid.  (Granted, he&#8217;ll never quite look the part, but he does what he&#8217;s paid to do!)  Also, I could sit and watch Penelope Ann Miller read the label of a mayonnaise jar because I&#8217;m that interested in watching her work.  Lastly, there&#8217;s a great roundtable of young actresses in this that are clearly destined to have some very good careers.  Writer director Connie Stevens has put together a winning ensemble around Tatum O&#8217;Neal that looks and sounds pretty spiffy.The bad?  Well, it just wasn&#8217;t all that interesting.  Maybe that says more about me as a viewer and a critic than it does the film, but, for all of the posturing, whining, and moaning in this Peyton Place kinda sorta wannabe, I just didn&#8217;t feel all that motivated.  Inspired.  Or interested.Now, that may speak to Connie Stevens&#8217; weaknesses as a storyteller.  In a career that spanning nearly seven decades (you read that right), she&#8217;s best known as a luscious blonde with terrific comic timing.  FYI: this is only her second screenplay, and it&#8217;s based on a true story.  I tend to think that something was lost in the adaptation process that maybe a more learned, more experienced scriptwriter could&#8217;ve positively affected &#8211; namely, emotional journeys that resonate for all of the characters and not so few.  Of course, I&#8217;m not questioning the relevance of the subject matter, as even today societies around the world continue to struggle with how to confront mental illness.  By this film&#8217;s tragic conclusion, I thought I was losing my mind trying to keep it all together.As much as I wanted to enjoy GRACE, in the end I thought it was a bit of a narrative mess, not unlike Grace&#8217;s own fragile mind.  Not enough of it made perfect sense, but I couldn&#8217;t force myself to look away, even when I tried.  Exceptional performances across the board just weren&#8217;t enough to make this world come alive the way it should.SAVING GRACE B. JONES (2009) is produced by Shane Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled by Arc Entertainment.  As for the technical specifications?  This is one smartly shot period drama (1940&#8217;s 1950&#8217;s), and it works very well from start to finish though there was one sequence wherein it was blatantly obvious actor Scott Wilson&#8217;s dialogue was dubbed in post production.  Lastly, I&#8217;d be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out that the film and actresses were highly decorated as part of the 2012 New York City International Film Festival, and the feature won &#8216;Best Dramatic Feature&#8217; at the 2011 Los Angeles Women&#8217;s International Film Festival.  Kudos to all involved.  Unfortunately, the disc offers no special features to speak of.INTERESTING but it&#8217;s honestly still HARD TO RECOMMEND.  At 116 minutes, SAVING GRACE B. JONES is just too darn long.  It&#8217;s clear to see why this is a favorite of critics &#8211; it indicts small town America for something the entire world has difficulty with, and that&#8217;s recognizing not only how to deal with deep rooted psychological problems but also how to deal with them &#8211; and critics love to see America brought to its knees.  At best, JONES is the kind of film that might be worthy of film club study; otherwise, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see why this one took so long to find a distributor to the mjazzes at large.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Arc Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SAVING GRACE B. JONES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",Uneven GRACE Feels A Bit Too Theatrical For Its Smalltown Roots,1400544000,"05 20, 2014",2,-1

"I've read where this is the last of the franchise that began in 1992 with Jean Claude Van Dam and Dolph Lundgren at their peak.  It is the only one of the series that I saw and I don't remember much other than it was OK.  Here, they make brief appearances as leaders of the secret UniSols project.The headliner this time is Scott Adkins as John who appears to be just another citizen being awoken by his young daughter who hears something downstairs.  It is Luc Devaraux (Van Damme) and a few cutthroats who then torment John with the brutal murder of his family and beat him within an inch of his life.  John lives and of course seeks revenge.  But some things are fuzzy in his head as he mends in his hospital room.The plot didn't make any sense to me but then I missed all those sequels.  Still, good sequels can usually stand on its own.  This film is not much more than a traditional bad guys vs. good guy blood bath.  I did like some of the fight sequences and clearly Adkins knows what he's doing on the martial arts front.  So does Andrei Arlovski as one of Devaraux henchmen.

"This is a kind of amateurish film, with very poor character development. In fact, we only really get to know the female lead. In contrast, portrayals of the mother, father, boyfriend and sister are empty and shallow. While there is some hint of incestuous abuse early on, this thread is cut off with no follow up. As for the pornography, it consists primarily of some topless shots and what might be called "" dirty talk."" A number attractive women are also shown kissing each other. Some males also do the same. The only bright spot in this production is the physical beauty of the female lead. The ending is kind of amorphous and the acting is sometimes hysterical  as marked by over the top emotional outbursts. Watching this film probably won't hurt you, but I don't believe that you'll get much it of it either.

"This story centers around Lindsey (Anna Kendrick) who has caught the eye of the portly foul mouthed Anti Christ (Craig Robinson) who prefers to be called ""The Beast."" Her complaining mother has returned from heaven, having been kicked out of the rapture.The idea was clever, especially how man learns to calmly deal with the various plagues thrown his way.

"I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the ""hype"" surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media.  This show is another one of those ""con"" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It's depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn't.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly  unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve  so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he's either bitter or angry.

"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction. When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people jazzumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety. It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes. When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing. Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two. I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had jazzumed were full season DVD releases. Personally, I didn't agree with the decision but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included. Anyone who read the box knew what to expect: how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Now here's a leap backwards for ""American Pickers,Volume 4.""I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside. Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package), it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting. I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information. My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base. I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!  It's not the price (which is in line with the contents), it's the lack of information that bothers me.I, however, will tell you what is inside. The 2 DVD set has eight episodes, a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box?Season Two: (1) Fairlane Fever, (2) Too Hot To Handle, (3) Trading Up, (4) The Emu Chase, (5) Keep Out!, (6) They Boldly Go, (7) The Possum Trot, and (8) California Dreamin.  There are no special features, but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise, for anyone unfamiliar with the show, is that two ""pickers"" (Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way. Some of the items may have historical significance.  That's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup. In truth, the show has similar appeal to the cljazzic ""Antique Roadshow"" mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of ""Storage Wars"" with a dash of ""Hoarders"" thrown in for good measure. It's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone's garage or junkyard. Along the way, the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana.  An interesting show, but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases.

"Despite being an Anglophile, after watching the first episode I just haven't bothered watching the rest.  Parade's End is beautifully done with all the attention to detail and period touches we've come to expect from productions of this caliber.  The acting is good too, but I just couldn't connect with the character's motives.For example, with the central married couple: the husband (and show's main character), meets his future wife on a train and falls so hard and fast for her that despite his gentlemanly, old fashioned scruples, they have one off sex right then and there in the train car.  But in every other scene he is excruciatingly well mannered and honorable and he sacrifices his own happiness and reputation to do the right thing by this two timing, family abandoning, excused of a wife.  She is supposed to be such a fun uppercljazz femme fatale, but the only side we are shown of hers is that of a homewrecking, love them and leave them beast.  She's not charming or crazy beautiful, she doesn't seem to care about anything or anybody, so what gives?It's not upliftng but depressing, and next we get to see how WWI affects these charming characters, really?

"It still amazes me how little people prepare themselves for making what is probably the biggest investment in their lifetime. They worry about little things like the color of paint, or cleaning the carpet. One couple liked the look of ivy climbing up a cinder block wall which faced their back yard. It didn't bother them that the wall was part of the industrial building next door. They didn't stop to realize that the price of the house, which was lower than typical for that street, had a reason. The higher priced houses were farther down the street from the factory, Other people liked the furnishings, or other items in a house, which normally do not go with the sale of the house unless those items are in a separate personal property sale agreement. Finally, I don't know many people who purchase a house after looking at only three houses.  This program has too much repeating of names, locations, and other facts, and in general is a poorly made time filler.

"Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years, I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique. But, before you press that unhelpful voting button (which, please, don't do until you have read my entire review) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series. At the beginning of its lengthy run, it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you, and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes. Sadly, that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years, the program has underwent a deterioration in quality (I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants). The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced (stupidity, greed) as pointed out by many other people, and the episodes and specials have a ""rushed"" feel to them. They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons (which, albeit they may not bother many other people, enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid. The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny, and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart. If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes, watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained.

"The acting really needs work here! That's my #1 criticism for this movie! This movie doesn't make me believe and if I don't believe them, how in the world will I like it? I won't. I just kept thinking, they're not really playing their roles well. They didn't take me away from reality and the terrible poor acting.Okay, so what do I like in this movie. I liked the police car chases and the races with all the other sports cars. I also liked how they were great at trying to adapt the video elements into the movie. I feel they were heavily influenced by the ""Need For Speed Hot Pursuit series"". And finally, I liked the hot main actress. That's pretty much all I liked about the movie.I can tell you that this movie was better than ""Getaway, 2013"" with Ethan Hawke and Selena Gomez. That movie was just terrible, so give them a hand folks?! *Slow and quite clapping*Okay, so if you want to see a good racing movie though, you can watch Fast and the Furious 1, 2, or 3. Don't watch any other Fast and the Furious movie after 3 because those ARE NOT about racing.I thought this movie could had been the best, if they got better main actors and had a way better story. Forget the tragic lost of a friend and just keep the love story and rival plot. That would had make it slightly better. As for the main male actor, he really doesn't know how to act! It just got to distracting seeing him on the screen trying to become his character. He seemed too unstable with his emotions all the time. Every other min, happy, sad, depressed, basically all over the map. Throw that guy out!Yes, I think you people should watch this movie, but no need to buy it.

"It's hard to tell whether ""A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III"" is a good natured bit of self parody on the part of Charlie Sheen, poking fun at his reputation as a compulsive womanizer, or a vanity project designed to showcase the actor's now legendary sexual prowess and playboy image. I suspect it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it still doesn't make for a very entertaining movie.In plot, the movie feels an awful lot like a full length version of ""Californication,"" as a middle aged, sungljazz wearing Angeleno laments how he's brewed up with the love of his life (Ivana played by Ketheryn Winnick) because he's never grown up enough to stay committed to a monogamous relationship.Writer director Roman Coppola's eclectic, scattershot approach alternates between scenes set in reality   or a close proximity thereof   and wild, but surprisingly flatfooted fantasy sequences heavy on op and pop visuals and graphics (Charlie is himself a successful graphics designer) and light on originality and cleverness. Apparently, there's not really all that much worth taking a glimpse of in ole Charlie's mind after all. Indeed, despite a big name cast that includes Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman and Patricia Arquette, the movie feels an awful lot like a third rate film school project that somehow got green lighted by an actual studio.",Not much worth taking a glimpse into here,1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2,-1

"Dear Hollywood: Please stop making bad movies about Mars. The Red Planet alone is not enough to carry a movie.The best example possible is ""Last Days on Mars,"" which has no plot or concept beyond ""there are zombies... ON MARS!"" I can't imagine that anyone involved put any more thought into this movie than ""zombies... ON MARS!"", because there is literally nothing else to it. It's a mediocre, unscary zombie story transplanted into a shallow copy of ""Alien.""And while it stars two actors that I adore, their good performances couldn't save this wretched pile of festering fetid celluloid    it has no plot, no real climax, a third act that drags on forever, and characters with the depth of a shopping list.Mankind has landed on Mars, and now scientists have gone there to do... stuff. Their goals are never really explained. Then a team finds a mysterious bacterium growing on Mars, but before they can study it further, one of the astronauts falls into a sinkhole and dies. Then he comes back as a desiccated mummy, and immediately power drills one one of his crewmates... and no, that is NOT a euphemism.Yes, the mysterious bacteria turns people    living or dead    into zombies, and it takes almost nothing to infect people. The astronauts frantically try to stop the zombies who (for some reason) are desperate to kill them, and must find a way off Mars before all of them are infected. And since this is trying to be ""Alien"" with zombies, they want to keep it from reaching Earth.It is honestly difficult to summarize this turd. Here's how I imagine the conception of this movie went: two inept Hollywood producers were sitting together, having a conversation.""Hey, I've got this idea. It's zombies...""""Totally overdone.""""... ON MARS.""""Genius! It technically hasn't been done before! We're greenlighting it!""That is the entire plot. No twists. No unexpected discoveries. No suspense about how they will stop the bacterium. It's just a string of zombie attacks that lead to nothing, placed in a third rate ""Alien"" clone    there is literally nothing to watch except the astronauts being infected and zombified one by one. It's not suspenseful, just depressing.First time director Ruairi Robinson just doesn't have the chops (yet) to pull off a full length movie. Most of it is shot at night, where it is impossible to see anything except darkness and clouds of red dust, and the jazzorted astronauts all look identical in their suits. Even worse, the ending drags on forever. The final half hour is the longest third act I've ever seen in a movie    just a slow, climax free drag that finally putters out when Robinson runs out of things to do.It also has characters just deep enough to give you paper cuts. There's a halfhearted attempt to give Liev Schreiber's character a tragic past, by hinting at a disaster that has made him claustrophobic (for some reason). But the disaster is never expounded on, and it's just sort of dropped halfway through the movie. The rest of the characters can be summed up in one or two words    Abrasive, Leader, Perky, Coward, et cetera.And honestly, the actors deserved better. Liev Schreiber gives a sort of halfhearted but serviceable performance; Romola Garai seems to be pouring her heart into a thanklessly shallow role, but she does give the movie its only moment of real pathos. There are other good actors here    Goran Kosti&#263;, Elias Koteas    but they're pretty much cannon fodder. Tossing out a mention of a character having kids does not make them three dimensional.""Last Days on Mars"" is just another dumb, inept zombie movie, and setting it on the maligned Red Planet doesn't really improve matters. Only die hard fans of Schreiber or Garai should even bother.","The spiders... I mean, zombies of Mars",1389916800,"01 17, 2014",1,-1

"It seems since season 10 or 11, each season has had really mediocre bad episodes and one or two exceptional ones, rinse and repeat. I love all of Trey Parker's works, ranging from Cannibal the Musical to the Book of Mormon, but south park is frankly getting lazy. Stop me if you've seen this before: Cartman takes something to a whacky extreme, and when people see how depraved whacky he is, they just stare at him with their mouths agape while he keeps doing his song and dance.

Same applies to whichever other character decides to go apesh** in each South Park episode, everyone just mutely stares at whatever's going on.It's this predictability that's made South Park stale and boring.

Well, I wasn't bored, because I was laughing at the terrible dialogue.  Kids shouldn't even watch this.  It would rot their brains.  It is that stupid.That said, the show has some funny moments and a few good characters.  I question why someone would act the way they do in this show, but if you overlook the bad acting and terrible writing, it has some small hint of merit.  It has an interesting theme, which is a British private school with lots of mysterious disappearances.  They could have explored the disappearances from a more scary or eerie perspective, but the writers apparently do not want to freak out the kids.  Give kids more credit!  My 13 year old brother has watched horror flicks all his life.  He would never watch this show.Now, I must admit that I was tempted to just skip a few episodes and go straight to the end of the first season.

"I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times. For me it hit every note exactly right. Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds, the usual problem with most sequels.If you haven't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters' type program that we find is more staged than reality. In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they're placed in a body bag. It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film. Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex. When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own. The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along. The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering. But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in. When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard's death. Frightened and unable to leave, the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did. It's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film, the host of the show, who has been trapped here for years. Can they escape with his help even though he hasn't been able to all this time?That's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film. The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen. But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I don't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture. It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story. Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time (no pun intended) prior it isn't worth it.

"This movie, starring Elizabeth McGovern among others, has an obvious similarity to Downton Abbey and no doubt fans of that wonderful series will be drawn to it. But the similarity is all on the surface. In fact, this turns out to be a pretty dour and rather boring excursion into the emotional stuntedness of the English upper middle cljazzes during the 1930s.It all takes place at a country house in Devon on a single day. Dotty, a rather vapid young thing who is pretty but not much else, is marrying the square chinned Owen. But she has invited her former swain Joseph to the festivities    and he for some reason has come. The house fills with guests, none particularly interesting, and Dotty knocks back slugs of rum while waiting for Joseph to do something    which he never quite manages.We also get flashbacks to the lovers the previous summer, boating on the river, kissing in the conservatory, running through the rain etc etc. We wait for them to give in to the dictates of the heart   and wait and wait and wait until the closing credits.Downton Abbey is great not only because the characters are vivid and memorable and the writing and acting are superb but because we also learn something about the way English society was changing before, during and after the Great War. The web of relations between upstairs and downstairs is interesting and provides for great drama.This movie does none of that.

I think Heather has exerted too much influence over this show because she is Jewish and so are the show's producers, and that is one tribe that sticks together. Heather pretends to a kind amiable character that she does not possess; she has now twice kicked another cast member out of her house when her or her husband's comments rebounded back on them (and who can forget the infamous ""intervention"" Heather staged when she viscously blindsided Alexis while on vacation). I miss Alexis too; maybe she wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed, but she had a good heart (more than can be said of Heather), and Alexis is the greatest beauty that has appeared on any of these house wife shows. I think her beauty is why Heather was so jealous of her; that, and the fact that she is pointedly Christian and Heather is Jewish. I strongly suspect that Heather had Alexis blacklisted. Apart from being eye candy, it was fascinating to watch as Alexis fought for parity in her marriage. They should bring Alexis back.

"I rated the movie a one.  I love Bobcat and Williams is an excellent actor.  But, I saw no value in the movie except for maybe the last minute and a half. It is not a dark comedy, I adore dark comedy.  I rented the movie ""This must be the Place"" and that was a good movie with dark comedy.  There was also plenty of depth.  This movie was about the human condition.  Exaggerated maybe, but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality. The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way.  People can read what they want to into the movie to justify recommending it, but there was really nothing beneath the surface and there was nothing worth laughing at; even in sarcasm.  As a matter of fact, they were two people I'd rather not know, and that includes the hour plus minutes I spent staring at them via the computer monitor.",Worlds Greatest Dad,1371340800,"06 16, 2013",1,-1

"This is the worst season of the series.  The first few seasons had me laughing so hard.  But this season, everything seems so forced.  Penny seems to be more of a miserable lush than previous seasons.  The exchanges between Howard and Bernadette are so dull at times.  I don't know what the heck Raj is doing, but watching a full show stacked with tidbits of a texting date ended up putting me to sleep.  However, I see the progression of Sheldon's character with Amy as an interesting story line and see this as taking center stage instead of the Howard and Bernadette snoozefest and the painful Leonard and Lush Amy storylines soon.  I wish there was not so much angst in those relationships.  It would be funny to see Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny in a competition to see who is the most pjazzionate or romantic couple only to have Sheldon try to join in the competition out of pure competitiveness where he suffers a kiss from Amy for the sake of the cause and make Raj the black horse out of nowhere!",Not the Best Season,1363737600,"03 20, 2013",2,-1

I can't believe I wasted my time and suffered through them.  This show just is not funny in the least.  It's hammy, stupid, utterly unrealistic in any possible way, the writing is bad, the acting is horrible.  There are other similar ""loopy and unrealistic"" TV shows, such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs, that work (I love both those shows).  But 30 Rock is just bad.  It doesn't work.  It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time.  The show's ""stars"" Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all.  Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny, but it's almost like you feel bad for him that he's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts.

And her 'shine' is awesome  she is gorgeous, sexy and has a spunky character to work with, but...the show seems to say ""Mediation"" is the second coming and that just didn't 'win' me over. Sarah's relationship with her ex husband the DA is ok and I like how she interacts with the other characters in her short skirts but the 'meat' of the program that Mediation results in a 'win,win' situation for folks headed to Court with lawyers is just not that interesting or believeable.

"So what is this? A comedy? A drama? A dramady? A insider's look at cljazzical music? What? Aside from ridiculous, what was the intention behind this show? That is my question.1) Look, I am pro sex, nudity, and all kinds of grown up things that people do with their bodies. But seriously, did the pitch for this show go this ... &#34; There are instruments and an ingenue and sex is literally everywhere. It's just sex and instruments   it's just so so sexy.&#34; But it's not sexy. That's the problem. Putting sex in every scene or talking about it in every scene does not make a show sexy. Not that I am even pretending that this show has any viable premise whatsoever. It doesn't. There is just so much to write about   if your topic is in fact New York musicians   that I can't believe you made the most boring silliest show that I've seen [from Amazon].2) The characters are all caricatures. The conductor actually has ringlets [like Shirley friggin Temple   RIP] and dresses like he's going to a costume party. There is absolutely no one who would think he's credible, especially over Roddy McDowell in NY or music or anywhere else but a loony bin. No one.3) There is a hot female cellist   whose only purpose seems to be to have sex with people or encourage other people to do so. I just don't understand her point. We get it already. This is a sexy show. You don't need someone her to say it in EVERY scene.4) What a waste of Bernadette Peters.5) I couldn't tell you where this show is going after the pilot, nor do I care. None of the characters seem anything more than a stereotype or some odd cartoon or likable, for that matter.6) Gabriel Garcia is just awful. I suggest a major re write, re cast or make sure this character is killed off before you continue. You can probably run over the cellist too   unless you intend to give her more to do than give blow jobs. I hear she's an actress, you might start there...It's too bad.

All of a sudden she is in charge, with some feeble threats against some real tough guys, that would not even make us weak ones flinch. Her all too well organized rave and fighting fiasco brings in more rowdy men than live under the dome and not only that, they let her keep the loot. It is extremely questionable that a bunch of burly mob, already under stress would let her get away with that. it's more likely they would stampede her to death and afterwards fight among them selves for the loot.Oh, and the voluntary gun give up. Is this Chester' s Mill Hollywood or Chester' s Mill USA. Because in Chester' s Mill USA, hardly anyone I know would give up their guns so easily. In all reality they would not give them up without a fight. That shows us how far Hollywood is removed from reality. This is complete nonsense.

That is reality not a theory of any kind.Another thing is, that the only people living in this town seem to be the main characters, everyone else seems to be able to leave the Dome and come back at the show director's command.

"Designed for the tech employee who feels their creativity is stifled by working on mundane coding or trouble shooting networks, and riding off of the Star Wars rift (rebel alliance fighting empire kind of thing), this show doesn't offer anything new or unique.  The theme here is that if that tech computer person, who is likely a sci fi fan, is feeling down in the dumps about his job, then the solution is to hook up with some hottie to ""fight the system"":  Or, in lay speak, get a woman to make your life feel easier.That's not such a bad message, but it's nothing new, and it's tiring.  That, and the the humor is predictable and fairly flat.  Maybe it's because I'm an older viewer who's heard all the jokes, or maybe it's because as a science fiction fan I didn't find a whole lot of science in this fiction and didn't think the setup all that unique, but I didn't so much as grin at any of the humor.Well acted, well animated, good concept drawings, well staged, I'm sure this program will find a niche audience, but it feels a little spartan in the writing department (that, and drop the space nazi at the five minute mark who hands out the cyanide capsules...or make him something other than a paranoid Bavarian knockoff).It's not a production I would back.",cliche,1367020800,"04 27, 2013",2,-1

"Reason that I don't like it: the character visuals  there's a robot and a cat, ok. No clue what the other three things are, but the orange one is WAY too much of a ""one eyed worm"" and screams of inappropriate visual for a child. That said, the songs are fun, simple and repetitious, so my 9 month old daughter breaks into a smile as soon as she hears them. I played some of the season selection for her one day...because she liked the songs from their ""cameo"" appearances in other shows on Nick Jr. I've since found some other shows with songs that make her smile and laugh that don't have a phallic appearance  such as Go, Diego, Go! and Bubble Guppies.  Edited several months later: I still don't really like Muno's appearance, but I developed the notion that DJ Lance is similar to Ronald McDonald (I met a DC region Ronald...very nice, keeps things friendly and non threatening and upbeat for little ones), and his odd ""posse"" is akin to Ronald's (Hamburglar, Grimace, Mayor McCheese and Fry Guys roughly = Brobee, Muno, Foofa, Bot), but they aren't promoting eating at a franchise.

"This is a thinly scripted fake reality program about gold mining. The two lead characters are supposed failed real estate hustlers who are deep in debt and who are going to save themselves financially by mining gold in Africa. The show's speciality is fake peril. Lots of overly dramatic moments involving crime, dealing with criminals, fights and so on. With almost a two person cast at a few locations, the show profits are probably good but they are constantly having to be very inventive to fill airtime. They manage to keep the program going (often in spite of itself) through sheer energy.The show isn't big on continuity. No mention of last seasons investor and get equipment magically back without paying bills owed. And once again, though mining in the bush, everyone is very, very clean. I hope they manage to do some competent mining at some point in this season. But I kind of doubt it.Those involved in the show deserve a degree of technical credit for being able to produce a watchable hourlong show like this with a primary cast of two.

"One of those things you watch on Netflix when there's nothing  else to wawth   I agree with the other reviewers that this should be seen as a character study of a disturbed individual.

"You're going to need a lot more than naked Scarlett Johansson to save this film.  Yes, she is naked in so many scenes that I forget how many.  And the nudity actually made sense for each scene.  I think.Still, this movie has no plot  it wanders.  Its end is absolutely horrible.  The film explains nothing.  No characterization, no motivations, no antagonist, no climax  this film is NOT A STORY.  It is a dream like succession of interesting and sometimes beautiful cinematography.If you have a hard time with Scottish accents, forget this film.  I could hardly understand 90% of the &#34;dialogue.&#34;  And the men talking don't matter to the plot anyway.  In reality, they were captured by hidden camera and spliced into the film.  Really weird technique that only makes the movie less watchable.Be warned: There is a lot of nudity.  Scarlett is a beautiful, REAL woman.  Her body is like a healthy ideal for women.  But it gets a bit tiring.  Believe it or not.  And the naked men were not my cup of tea.  Walking into traps with erections.  No thanks.While the bulk of this movie is absurd and slow and pointless, the STRANGE visual beauty of the film is to be commended.  Even the naked bodies were lighted (or shadowed) interestingly.  The scenes are all creepy and make even the most mundane parts of our world seem alien.But save it for the art house!  Give us story!  Not a presentation of weird cinema.Why did I even watched till the last scene?  We learn nothing.  Our heroine accomplishes nothing.  In fact, she nearly SAYS nothing.Well, the visual weirdness of the movie is like a slideshow.  You begin to realize that you are NOT watching a movie in the traditional sense.  Instead you are just watching art.  Set in a world in which something alien is kidnapping humans.  I think.Under the Skin makes the book it is based upon seem like the ramblings of an idiot or a drug addled, paranoid teenager.  I feel bad for the author.

"That is how I watched this series. It is fun to watch if you expect nothing else than just pjazzing some time watching old fashion TV without paying a lot of attention. The main character's acting is terrible. She is pretty and fit. And there is not scene in which you can believe for a second that she is CIA or scared or being tortured or in love. She looks at every men with exactly the same expression. Which is exactly the same expression that she has when she looks at women. Or walls. Or guns. Or phones. Or whatever. The writing is poor so what she looks at really does not matter. But the series is not bad as in hard to watch. It is quite easy to pjazz the time with it. It is the old fashion TV formula    a CIA target is discovered, pursued, and turned or captured in less than a day by an unexperienced, not really compelling pretty girl making cute dog faces without any clever plan. There also some senseless subplots with absurd conspiracies  most of them focused on Russia because here the Cold War has not ended  and the CIA here is run by a married couple in which he is the big boss and she is something of a maternal #2. They could have made a vintage piece, a la Mad Men, and it would have been charming, but comparing this to Mad Men is like comparing the taste of the best chocolate to an used chewing gum.",Good for an easy a TV marathon if you have too many hours ahead and nothing else to do,1354665600,"12 5, 2012",2,-1

"Possible spoilers.High concept and no brain techno thriller about a young woman using a video chat room as part of a grant funded project who becomes the target of a high tech psychopath.  Unfortunately every ounce of thought that was put into this movie went into the visual design (Let's shoot a movie where all the footage is on web cams and computer screens  cool!) and none apparently went into the threadbare and consistently illogical script.The problems start almost immediately when our heroine pitches her project to the university board.  Her pitch is basically I'm going to use a video chat for three months and find out about people and stuff.  Despite the lack of any apparent scientific purpose to her project it's approved  and then things rapidly get more idiotic.The Den is one of those video chat sites where you can switch from person to person randomly, pressing next if you don't like what you see.  The filmmakers didn't give any thought to what you might actually see on such a chat site  what they come up with is and old, overweight woman with too much make up filming herself laughing like she's a character in a David Lynch movie; a group of people who prank unwitting viewers by playing a fake game of Russian roulette; some guy with a cute dancing penis puppet; etc.  While this is all stuff that would not be out of place on You Tube as filmed video if this were being performed live in a rapid screen chat environment then basically you would have people performing the same bit of performance art over and over and over every 30 seconds or so, which is about as believable as anything else in this train wreck.The heroine is supposedly tech savvy, yet it's obvious very early in the movie that her laptop has been hacked and she does absolutely nothing about it.  It's not like she has no options  she could ask her techi  pal who set up the video recording software on her computer to take a look or she could just ditch the infected laptop and use some of her grant money for a new computer.  Even after she tells her project adviser from the university that her computer has been hacked she still continues to use it and does nothing to protect herself.Later her boyfriend disappears and she's sure it's related to whomever is stalking her via the internet.  This is such a basic idea that you would think there's no way the filmmakers could brew it up but they do.  You see not only did the boyfriend disappear but every scrap of furniture in his apartment disappeared as well, leaving nothing behind but a laptop which is on the floor transmitting to the villain (or villains).  When someone who has a job and a girlfriend disappears for a day or two without warning they don't take their furniture with them  it would have been much less suspicious (not to mention a lot less work) if the villain (or villains) had grabbed the b.f. without also cleaning out his apartment.  Luckily for the villain (but unfortunate for the heroine as well as common sense) the police don't find the situation suspicious at all and tell her to stop wasting their time.The Den actually continues to get worse after that until it finally runs out of even bad ideas and pretty much just turns into an amazingly dumb and gore free knock off of Hostel if it were directed by Uwe Boll in first person video game mode.Not recommended unless you are determined to see every single horror movie that comes out this year.",Slick and idiotic,1399766400,"05 11, 2014",1,-1

"I got the pilot episode of The Cape for free on Amazon Video on Demand. I watched it. I'll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation crime syndicate. Since he is jazzumed to be dead, he cannot go back to his wife or son   though, in a maudlin moment, he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping. There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him, the cop watches from behind a tree, about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC. Somehow, though, all the police, whom one jazzumes to be alert and vigilant, miss his presence.Anyway, somehow, and I really do not understand how or why, he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members. They seem to perform before a similar number of people. Sets are not a strong point. He performs by battling a small person (ok   dwarf) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves, if Reeves were actually trying to act. The black guy is a master magician, and he trains the ex cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician   the magic is fake, but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode. Since he used to read a comic called ""The Cape"" to his son to put him to sleep, the ex cop jazzumes the identity of ""The Cape."" This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes, and he has been committing crimes in costume, even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate. For sheer fun, one presumes. These are the crimes pinned on the ex cop. They are designed to force ""the city"" to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation, which the city promptly does. Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated, and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord's head henchman turns out to be the Cape's former best friend and police partner, who framed him because Mr. Evil threatened to harm his family. He is, however, not a happy henchman. In these sorts of bad movies shows, having a family is a definite no no.I don't know who any of the actors were, but none of them were very good, except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp cartoon and occasionally funny.

Let's see:1) The guy driving on the bridge and looking at his watch.  Really? A watch? Who's wearing a watch? What about a smartphone or maybe just the time on the dashboard?2) Someone manages to shut down and then turn back on all the power on both sides of the border.  Really? Come on man.3) First really bad line of the show ""Shut down the border!"".4) Some guy smokes a cig, puts it out and takes the butt.  Then walks away.  Obviously we're meant to be like ""oh remember that guy"" but really it feels like they're banging us over the head with it.5) The detective woman is wearing her iPhone earbuds while she walks over the crime scene. Really? If the writers want to give us the notion that she's all like ""Whatever.. blah blah"" then at least spend a few minutes building that rather than trying to convince us with some iPhone earbuds. Really, do detectives show up to a middle of the night call listening to their iPod?6) Of course she's inhospitable to the detective on the other side of the border.7) Very, very oddly enough there's an ambulance coming FROM Mexico over to the USA. I suppose its possible but does that happen??  Also, her husband is theoretically dying in the ambulance and the detective is like ""oh well, he can just die because you can't cross"" when clearly the ambulance would be let through.8) The wife tries to hand some hundreds to the police detective to let her through.

"This was a horrible waste of $9.99 for a ""pre theatrical"" rental.  If this movie ever comes out in a theater, I'd be quite shocked more by that than anything in the movie.It was so stupid and poorly done on all levels, that I watched most of it on FF just to get through it in case somehow all this tied together with something more than the ending it did have.As someone else aptly put in the title of their review...""This movie sucks"".  I agree.But to each their own.I've seen several posts praising this movie for being ""daring"", ""innovative"", ""superb"" even.  Did we watch the same movie?!?!

"Oh, NBC. We'll spare you the interrogation (that one could last for weeks). Instead, we'll let Whitney Cummings be your scapegoat, since she was bold enough to plaster her name and face all over your new series, Whitney.  At best, a cross between Fran Drescher and Audrey Hepburn, Cummings isn't without charm. Her raunchy antics elicit the occasional laugh in the show's pilot episode. Known for her recurring appearances on E!'s Chelsea Lately, she is the least likely choice of Handler's panel to helm her own series. This is especially so given a low concept like the one Whitney offers.It takes a whole lot of cool to rest solely on a personality for material. Unfortunately for Whitney, the cool points are obliterated by the laugh track that makes the show feel stale and dated. The episode begins with the disclaimer, ""Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience,"" which feels like a desperate apology for the awkward format. Giving it the benefit of the doubt, the live audience might be present to poke fun at the traditional sitcom, or to capture the magic of Whitney Cummings's stand up skills. The intent is far from clear or successful, and we are left wondering if we are laughing with or at Whitney.Whitney is flanked by a horde of stereotypical female friends that don't help her cause. However, the men in the ensemble redeem the show  counterintuitive, given the women's empowerment potential of a female driven program. Maulik Pancholy (Weeds, 30 Rock) portrays a straight guy for a change, and he breathes fresh life into the show. As does the leading man, Chris D'Elia, who plays Whitney's quirky cool boyfriend, Alex. D'Elia steals every scene, exercising a quiet and unconventional magnetism. We vote the show be renamed Alex; ""it all begins when Alex ditches his insufferable girlfriend, Whitney..."" Now, there's a hit show, NBC.

"The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure.  It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there.  The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout.  The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed, characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense.  Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over acting the norm and erratic    unbalanced?    behavior expected.  I wouldn't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer, much less command a ship.  His always to excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command, a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin.  While a better leader than Bill Adama, she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust.  So, too, was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff.  Ultimately, I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care.  And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately didn't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons.  The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration.  I said in another review of the series    season 3?    that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away.  Ultimately, I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall, I liked the Cylons more than the humans.  I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable.  It sadly just wasn't executed well.  When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode to episode, you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet    I even hope    that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades.

He sets out looking for his brother Hakan who everyone thinks can restore order. Along the way Steinar begins to change and becomes the man his father was hoping for. I have never really been a big fan of the 300 type movies. I'm not sure why but the whole mid evil genre just doesn't do it for me.

There is enough action to keep you watching though, but the movie really starts to feel flat about a half hour in and never really picks itself back up. Fans of this genre may like this but I thought it was just a little too slow to stay fully interested in. Overall, another 300 rip off that feels flat.

"Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Area 407"" is never particularly effective at establishing its intentions. It's hard to discuss the flaws of the film without revealing too much, so I'll be purposefully vague. The movie charts a plane crash and its immediate aftermath in a desert region of the United States. The survivors of the crash face two imminent dangers (which I won't discuss) but the two threads don't really work well together. As the DVD cover positions the film as a monster movie, I'll say that particular element is handled reasonably well. You get occasional glimpses of the terror, but nothing of a full reveal until the very end. The more human side to the threat is a LOT more vague, unexplained, and frankly lacking in logic. I didn't necessarily hate ""Area 407,"" it just offers little new to this overused film technique. You've seen similar movies and you've seen them better.The movie begins on New Year's Eve as a cross country flight from New York to Los Angles is about to embark. Two young sisters are among the pjazzengers and the youngest is filming everyone in the most irritating way possible. Not to be unkind or personal, but the voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Seriously, I'd have rammed a pencil in my ear if I had been seated next to her. But of course, she is super precious and charming to everyone else and they proceed to treat her like a two year old for the remainder of the picture. The plane crash itself is decent, and I loved the way everyone's head was splattered with mjazzive amounts of bright red blood afterwards. A small band of survivors now must face the ultimate challenge to their survival. Who will make it through the night? What is stalking them? And can anyone help? The movie plays just as you would expect with people dropping like flies.I had two major issues with ""Area 407."" First, the logic of the ""found footage"" style is never adhered to very well. In one scene, for example, a menacing noise is heard in the woods. The young lady holding the camera never swings around toward the source of the noise like you would in real life, she keeps the shot firmly on the flight attendant's reaction. In a normal chain of events, they'd have been using the light to try to see what was making the noise and the attendant would have screamed ""get that camera out of my face, you bozo, don't you hear that screaming!"" But even more distracting, the film seems to lack a real screenplay (although FIVE people share a story credit for this thin tale). The cast (a couple of which are quite good) seem to be making dialogue up as the movie zips along. Needless to say, quite a few awkward and ridiculous phrases and exclamations are uttered before the night is through. All in all, the entire endeavor feels slight, familiar, and relatively amateurish. My simple wish is never to see another ""found footage"" thriller until someone has something new to offer. ""Area 407"" is not that movie. KGHarris, 8 12","Crash And Burn: An Amateurish ""Found Footage"" Thriller That Lacks Much Payoff",1345939200,"08 26, 2012",2,-1

"I really wasn't pulled into this show. It took far too long to set up the story and the only reason I didn't turn away was because I enjoy supporting Amazon Prime Pilot season and giving my feedback. Plus, I was too lazy to go searching for something else to watch. The characters were OK, but I found some of them way too cliched. Like the Mr. Ireland character who drank and cursed like a sailor. How original? I wasn't sure why the main actress was French either, seeing as it's set in the US and doesn't add anything to the show. The stronger leads were the established actors like Sharon Lawrence, Aldis Hodge and, surprisingly, Jamie Kennedy. There were things about the story that made no sense like the loss of time from when they entered the elevator to when they escaped. Why the hotel security guy was able to be paid off for taking the French actress up to her hotel room? If it's really the end of the world, what good is money? Also, why was no one allowed up to their hotel room, and all the floors were empty but the lobby was overrun with guests coming and going? Where were they coming from? Little details like that really bother me. Anyway, back to the concept of the show. I'm not sure what the concept is to be honest. It's not clearly spelled out in the pilot what is happening, or what the goal is of all these characters thrown together. Are they going to be living in that huge mansion together, or off in the woods? How will they survive? Is this an alien invasion or terrorism? Either way, I simply don't care. And that's the sad part! I don't really care enough about these characters to tune back in. I've seen far better shows over the years that have successfully set up their concept and established likeable characters from the beginning with a mix of action, suspense, comedy, and drama, such as: Sliders, Torchwood, The X Files, Eureka, and Supernatural to name a few; so I'm not interested in wasting my time here.

"[BEWARE: The following review of ""The Asylum Blackout"" contains minor spoilers.]The title tells everything about the story. Well, apparently. In ""Asylum Blackout"" (aka ""The Incident"") George, an aspiring rock musician (Rupert Evans), is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum. One night, while working at the asylum's kitchen with his friends and band members Max (Kenny Doughty) and Ricky (Joseph Kennedy), there is a power failure due to a storm, and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates, who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court&egrave;s (his feature debut) takes time in setting up the character of George   serious minded and short of sleep   and does it very well. George is very tired and clearly needs a rest, while the story unfolds from his viewpoint. George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate, but is it true?""Asylum Blackout"" has a few violent and gory torture scenes, but as the film's bizarre conclusion suggests, it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror, something more psychological. While the dimly lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George, there is also something wrong with the film's premise.For, in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller, you need, besides atmospheric photography, better narrative skills in telling the story. While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum, we ask ourselves: how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates? Why do the police take such a long time to respond?The film has potential for a more unnerving horror, but to create one you need a set up that is more credible and intriguing.",Trapped Inside the Asylum,1349913600,"10 11, 2012",2,-1

"On the plus side, this is a very tightly and professionally put together film. It's well edited, reasonably well structured, and contains a lot of footage from Hollywood A listers (and some I would consider B listers) telling their stories and giving their perspectives. Another plus is that the paparazzi too are given a chance to tell their side of the story.But on the down side, unless you've been living under a rock for the last 15 years or so, it contains little if anything that you won't have heard before. And yes, I really do mean many, many times before.Paparazzi, high price of fame, invasion of privacy, telephoto lenses, people's homes, Princess Dianna, Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian, it didn't used to be like this back when the studios ran things, sometimes the celebs or their agents set these things up themselves, the people buying the gossip mags or visiting the gossip websites bear ultimate responsibility...Won't somebody please think of the children...You know the drill.I originally titled this review ""Nothing You Haven't Heard Many, Many Times Before"". But then I realized that wasn't entirely true. It did tell the story of how back when the studios ran things, one magazine got info on Rock Hudson's homosexuality. It then went to his studio and basically said ""give us something better or we'll run this"". The studio then offered up another, far less prominent (and less profitable) homosexual actor on a platter, who was subsequently outed in the magazine and had his career ruined. Why the magazine went with this instead of doing the Rock Hudson piece isn't entirely clear, but anyway, that's the story. It takes up about a minute of screen time, and is literally the only thing in this film you might not have heard about before.As for the rest... It's not that I really disagree with anything this film has to say. It's just that like I keep saying, we've heard it all SO many times before.Given the almost total absence anything we're not all already completely familiar with (if not to say positively drenched in), I'd have to describe this work as what William Gibson prophetically called a ""meta tabloid"" in his novelVirtual Light, published way back in 1994.Great book, by the way.

"According to wikipedia dot org, it's a 2013 French Danish co production crime thriller film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. It was shot in Bangkok, Thailand.According to indiewire dot com, director Refn confirmed the cost of this movie was a little bit more than $5 millions.The worst thing about this movie was all main characters were emotionless. They did not express any emotion with their faces and words at all. It's as if they had been wearing masks. For example, the main policeman, he brutally killed some bad guys but his face was like a stone from the beginning till the end of the film. He did not show any anger or hatred.On top of that, there were very few dialogues. This made the problem worse.It's almost like a silent movie. For the first 10 minutes, it held my attention by forcing me to guess what would come next. Then, it became boring and tiring because I had to constantly try to interpret what the director wanted to convey with his video. It did not connect with me. It did not stir up any emotion. I did not care what happened to all the people. What's the point of watching a movie without feeling anything? In this regard, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's an example of how to make a bad movie.There are so many illogical holes and too much violence that make it less entertaining. For example, the scene where the jazzjazzin fired his machine gun into the small restaurant where the 3 policemen were eating. The policemen flipped the wooden table they're eating at and used it as a shield. Miraculously, no bullets hit the table. Yeah!The violence was so over the top that it became sadistic. For instance, there was a scene where the policeman poked the eye of a bad guy with a pointed metal stick. He also thrust it into the guy's ear.Almost everything was in slow motion. Even the scene where the policeman chased the jazzjazzin was in slow motion. At first, this technique drew my attention.

"Nine Things about the Movie &#8220;V H S 2&#8221; [USA, Indonesia, 2013]1. In 2012, &#8220;V H S&#8221; was released. It was an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There was about 10 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie.2. Here&#8217;s V H S 2&#8221;. It is an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There is about 5 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie..3. The first story is about a guy that gets a video camera for an eyeball, which lets him see dead people that move his video game controller and teapot. He meets a girl that got an electric ear, which lets her hear dead people, including her fat uncle. She has to take her clothes off to get him to leave. Together, they meet other dead people, who are mean.4. The second story is about a zombie attack. Now, you might think that a zombie attack, told from the point of view of a camera on a zombie, would be interesting. But you would be wrong.5. The third story is about a cult that waits until a documentary crew arrives before they go on a murderous rampage and give birth to a demon. The story makes absolutely no sense, but it&#8217;s the best story of the whole movie just because it has the most gore.6. The fourth story is about a group of teenagers that like to have sex and masturbate. But their fun is ruined when aliens invade their house and start killing them. This time, we know the whole terrible story because a camera was attached to the family dog.7. This movie underscores the problem with &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. Everybody needs to be filming everything at all times. People need to have cameras in their eyes, on their bikes, on their helmets, in their clothes, in their house, in their car, and on their dog. And they need to all be filming 24 7. And once everybody is dead, someone has to find all the footage and edit it together into a story.8. If you think the &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; films are documentaries, this movie might scare you. Otherwise you will laugh at the cheap effects, the cheap scares, and the cheap acting. Characters will think of the stupidest thing to do, and then do it. Not to mention the fact that each story barely has a plot, anyway.9. This movie proves that &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films have not only jumped the shark, they&#8217;re not even in the water anymore.","Let's just quit with the ""found footage"" crap, OK?",1402876800,"06 16, 2014",1,-1

"The action thriller ""Java Heat"" isn't necessarily a terrible movie, it just ends up being entirely forgettable and somewhat empty headed.  The movie looks like it will be a contemporary political puzzler, but never makes the most of its exotic locale and intriguing premise.  What might have been an intricate and relevant look at religious strife and political maneuvering quickly goes somewhere far less interesting from a plotting standpoint.  And when all the truths are revealed, my gut reaction was ""who cares?""  On the plus side, the movie is set in Indonesia which provides for plenty of local color.  The action sequences are well executed, even if there aren't any real stand out moments.  And the movie features a really appealing lead performance from Indonesian actor Ario Bayo as a local detective.  My principle negative, though, (aside from a rather mundane story) has got to be Kellan Lutz in the biggest role.  Lutz is a man committed to a mission, supposedly with plenty of secrets and savvy, but ends up coming off like a frat boy throughout.  He never demonstrates the smarts necessary to believe his character.  It's like he's making a buddy cop comedy and no one else is, so he seems completely out of place.The tale begins with Lutz in custody after a bombing which left the Indonesian Sultana dead.  As the woman was to be her country's future leader, her untimely demise has long range political repercussions.  Although suspicious of Lutz and his story, the detective in charge (Bayo) is thrown into cooperation with the American.  Lutz is not being entirely forthcoming, however, and his actions bring him to the attention of criminal mastermind Mickey Rourke.  As the investigation is leading to the unscrupulous Rourke, he takes counter measures.  Soon, there is all out warfare with many innocents in the crossfire.  As you might expect, there are plenty of fisticuffs, machine gun shootings, bombings, kidnappings, references to illicit sexual encounters with underage participants, and other manner of nefarious activity.  Just who is Lutz and what is his agenda?  What is Rourke's motivation?  As I looked forward to having these questions answered, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by their resolution.It's always good to see Rourke.  Here he is mumbling all of his lines in an ever changing accent.  When I could understand what he was saying, I was wondering what country he was supposed to be from.  His villain is colorful, to be sure, but lacks any nuance or believability.  From moment one, he is seething and over the top.  And Lutz is truly perplexing.  As this is set in the seamy underbelly of polite society, you'd think that our hero wouldn't be completely naive.  At one point, a man asks if he wants to solicit the sexual services of a girl, a boy, or a lady boy.  His cartoonish and shocked reaction is laughable.  His flirtations with the Sultana are truly painful too.  And when a stranger hands you a drink in a bar and you're on a very important mission, maybe you shouldn't swill it down without a second thought.  These are just a couple of moments that stand out, but his actions are perpetuated by nonsensical acts or inappropriate behavior.  I don't blame Lutz entirely, the screenplay can't decide on the tone to adopt.  Is ""Java Heat"" supposed to be lightweight and comical or dark and disturbing?  I still don't know.  And by not deciding, the picture fails to connect on either level.  KGHarris, 9 13.",Dark And Disturbing Or Lightweight And Comical?

"If ""House"" had an actor of lesser talent than Hugh Laurie, it would have been off the air after season 2.  By season 3, the shows were becoming formulaic and themes were being recycled.  Unfortunately, the solution was not to fire the writers but to back burner the primary actors.If the writers and producers had a bit more imagination and courage, they've got great characters and situations they could mine more deeply; instead, they chicken out, content to skim the surface.Season 4 pushes the viewer's willing suspension of disbelief past the breaking point.  Chase, an intensivist, becomes a skilled surgeon and Cameron, an immunologist, becomes a senior ER attending?  Really?  And they still want to work at the same hospital as House?

While setting up for the big July 4th festivities a small town in Maryland discovers some residents dead and no clues as to why.

She is very pro life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself. The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David (Rocko Hale) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers. This appears to be a ""come to Jesus film"" except the ""good guys"" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves. Indeed, if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget. The sets are meager. The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it. It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the ""secret"" of the film by reading the by line I couldn't help but think during the film...""Funny.

"Like others, I was smitten by this show during previous seasons. The hilarity of the characters and their   albeit sometimes decidedly &#34;illogical&#34;   interactions showered viewers with chuckles, raucous laughter and, as with any good sitcom, the occasional cringe worthy moment that makes you glad you're not experiencing whatever you're watching on the screen. I continue to feel that they should've tried harder to incorporate a long term story line for Sara Gilbert, whose particular brand of sarcasm, sneering and condescension lent itself well as a &#34;nemesis&#34; to Jim Parson's Sheldon Cooper.I've read several comments about the supposed misogyny and sexism in the show. To some extent, I agreed but in the earlier seasons it was easy to overlook. Sure, the fact that four geeks fawn over and end up being the main social circle for a bottle blonde waitress aspiring actress is cliche, but there was so much well written comedy to completely overlook that. Not anymore. Sadly, this season already starts out with yet more cliches designed to pander to what I can only imagine is a slew of viewers the fictional Dr. Sheldon Cooper was thinking of when stating, in a previous season, that stupid people make him sad.I won't post any spoilers here but I personally found the first two episodes of this season ridiculous and offensive   between the complete dilapidation of Sheldon's character to the ridiculously sexist jokes centering around Penny being a drunken idiot, women being overly emotional and men only caring about a woman's weight, to the even more ridiculously crude sexual innuendos...the show has basically lost the plot. Where there was once cerebral comedy that gave you side splitting laughter, I sat through several episodes of this season without so much as a chuckle. Sad, but I guess inevitable   looks like the same thing that happened to Mad Men after season 4 is now happening to TBBT.

"I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  I like Elijah Wood and John Cusack, both,...so for me, this was a pretty easy choice.  Unfortunately, the story just doesn't have the same quality as the actors that starred.The movie follows famed pianist, Tom Selznick (Wood), in his attempt to make a come back following a 5 year hiatus.  He had apparently attempted to play ""The Impossible Piece"" during his last live performance and hit the wrong notes causing him a breakdown and a newly acquired bout of stage fright.  His wife, Emma (Kerry Bish&eacute;), is a world famous actress that has set her sights on fixing his problem.  She sets up a symphony in honor of his recently deceased mentor, Patrick Godureaux (Jack Taylor) with Reisinger (Don McManus) acting as Conductor for the performance.  As Tom begins to play he sees strange markings in his sheet music.  After he begins reading, he is instructed to rush to his dressing room during a ""down moment"" in the piece, where he finds an ear piece which he then uses to communicate with Clem (Cusack), the man behind the strange writing.  Clem informs him that he MUST play ""The Impossible Piece"" at the end of the show to perfection or both he and his wife will die.Sounds interesting, right?  I sort of thought so too.  Of course, I also took into consideration the level of acting that was involved in the picture.  Unfortunately, they must have seen more than I did in the final product.  The movie, while interesting at times, is just too ridiculous to be believable.*******SPOILERS*******Apparently, Clem is a locksmith.  And having done work for the late Patrick Godureaux, he installed a lock inside his famous Grand Piano that only someone able to actually play, The Impossible Piece, could open.  Apparently, there are only 2 people that have this ability:  Godureaux and Tom Selznick.  Since Godureaux is dead, that only leaves Tom.  If this were the case, Clem (as an apparent MASTER locksmith(?)) could either break into the late Godureaux's estate and dismantle the piano for the key hidden within, or simple pick the lock that the key opens?  At the very least, couldn't he just have gotten Selznick alone and had him play it that way?  Either way, the whole plot seemed WAY to far fetched for my taste.  Besides, the contents of the safe are never revealed.******* END SPOILERS*******Final Verdict:  PASS!

"Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face.  Richard dealt with his dear sister's death and being molested for years without others knowing.  He's had it tough, but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure, except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell.  Richard did some activist non profit work; I'm guessing he had anti drug resources that he didn't bother to access.  Yes, his brother is was homophobic, but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around.  He is sucking his mother dry of money.  The work never mentions HIV AIDS, but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any ""Intervention"" episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones.  Richard wasn't even brave enough to stay.  You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs.  I highly doubt that.

"Well, the cover of the DVD with such words as Scandal, Child Star, Love Affair, Paparazzi etc, etc.. You'd think the movie would be entertaining, interesting, with a sense of taboo that just makes you want to watch it en grossly just much like the real love Story between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was. But No, as a viewer I don't get that. I don't get the sense of pjazzionate, scandalous and bizarre love affair. The Only thing I got from watching this Movie is a boring, bland and amateur re telling of a supposedly legendary love story of two film stars.What else can I say? Lifeless acting from most of the cast. Especially, Lindsay Lohan. Who ever thought she would do a good job at playing Elizabeth Taylor must've had a whimsical sense of humor indeed. Not denying that she's a bad actress watch her act in Mean Girls, The Parent Trap I've gotta give her some credit for acting in these two movies but in this one. Uh Uh she just did it all wrong! I didn't buy her as Elizabeth Taylor, I didn't buy the fact that she was madly in love to the point of damaging her career. She Just seemed off on screen. Not to mention the slim to none resemblance between her and the real Elizabeth, you'd think she'll put more effort into acting her role to compensate for that fact but no. I was pretty disappointed, the only thing she seemed to do was memorize lines and repeat them on screen with just a tad bit of emotions coming across. Even in her purposed outbursts she just seemed like a walking corpse that the writers weren't even interested in to begin with so they gave her horrendous lines and a very one dimensional character to portray.The Other actors aren't that great either but since they're not the main once they can get away with their zombie walks and poor acting skills. The One Playing Burton was acceptable but that's only because he was surrounded with such lame actors so he stood out as you can say. He tried his best for his defense too bad there was little he could do since the writing itself wasn't that helpful.The Movie itself was tasteless. Most of the time the viewers are told that this and that is happening. For Example, that Richard is cheating on his wife with another married woman which is Elizabeth and are deemed sinful in the eyes of the public but it just seems to come so easy for them afterwards. It's like no one really cares whether they were having an affair or not in such times when things like these were rare. The whole sense of impending danger, the whole sense of scandal is lost in this film.Watching it is like reading an article on the internet about Elizabeth and Richards relationship. That's all I can say. You might as well just read a 5 minute article instead of wasting your time watching this movie cause that's all you're gonna get in the end. The audience don't get to connect with the characters, we don't even get to meet them. We just see Lindsay Lohan presumably yelling, screaming, throwing fits of anger, crying, laughing, smoking, complaining, talking, swimming, kissing and whatever else she's doing on the film. And then the actors are just there. I could care less whatever happens to the characters at the end I don't even want to know. Even if the director decided to twist the story a little bit and have Elizabeth and Richard Commit suicide like Romeo and Juliet instead of divorcing I still wouldn't care.I Guess, I should give credit for the writers and producers for taking such a pjazzionate love affair and making it such a boring, tedious and whiny one.And Lindsay Lohan please next time don't accept a role if you're not gonna act it properly. I'm sure the director didn't intend for you to be a wallflower with nice clothes and make up.

"This is definitely a weak series. It's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC'd out it's hard to swallow. First of all the very silly idea that some ex rebel soldier would chase various people, even be able to do that much after a chaotic war, in order to get revenge for his wifes death GAG. The main character has such wooden acting it's hard to care much about anything he does, even cold blooded murder in revenge. Some ex slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for.

"I don't comprehend the moral or the mjazzage the producers were trying to send by making this movie. I also don't much understand the plot line really. Saying that it doesn't seem very entertaining to compensate for the lousy plot either so either way you're wasting your time.First of all, The actors are lame! Lindsey Lohan who's supposed to be the marketing ploy of this film is playing Tara a gold digger who exchanged her humble roots for a life of luxury even if it was costing her true happiness and safety. Supposedly, Tara is living with Christian a psychopathic maniac with mental problems we come to find out he has a shrink and a tendency to organize orgies at his apartment where he forces his Girlfriend Tara to participate in for the sake of his entertainment and then video tapes the sex sessions also for his pure entertainment. However, his odd behaviors and the fact that he's a controlling jerk didn't stop Tara from continuing her relationship with him after all he has money. Then enters Ryan Tara's ex boyfriend and her true love into the picture, now he is dating Christian's jazzistance and unbeknown to her or Christian these two ex love birds spark an affair in which Tara helps Ryan get the lead role for a small movie Christian is producing. Anyways, the whole movie is a cat mouse chase between keeping the affair secret from Christian, Christian suspecting it, spying on Tara, trying to destroy Ryan, having sex with random strangers and eventually succeeding in his quest for destroying Ryan who is broke and living under the roof of his current girlfriend with barely any money and yet somehow manages to live a pretty well off lifestyle if you ask me.All these characters seem to think about is money and sex and I mean all of them without any exceptions. Ryan objects strongly to the way Tara is living her life by leeching off a rich boyfriend and being untrue to her real self all the while he's doing the same exact thing by living off his Gf's house. Tara has two guys being overly obsessed about her and is described as very beautiful however Lindsey Lohan due to years of alcohol and drug abuse has totally ruined her natural looks and in this movie looks a lot older than her 27 years. She has so much surgery done to her face as well she looks fake and in no way beautiful as the producers would want us to believe not in a way that would generate such attention anyways. She did seem comfortable playing her role but then again it wasn't a very good role if you ask me. Not one that I was impressed by, you don't want to be playing a man's sex toy for a comeback role. The writing was mediocre it's almost like the writers make fun of their own movie by having Lindsey Lohan tell the actor played by Ryan that him being in a small movie won't make a difference anyways and since it is a low budget film then what'd you know? Oh the irony!In the end I felt like this was a let's pjazz time by because we're bored movie rather than an actual let's make a movie we are pjazzionate about movie. Also, in many ways I felt like the Christian character who's obsessed with orgies and sex as well as occasional murder is much like Christian Bale's character in American Psycho except this is the inferior version.Sorry Lindsey Lohan make next time you can pick a better role to play as your breakthrough role.

"Deadfall is a white noir, instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city, it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness. It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories  of Fargo  or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter, but ends up simply stuck a drift in it's own snow storm of tedium. This isn't a bad movie, per say, but it is middling, predicable and more often than not, dull. Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison (Eric Bana) and Liza (Olivia Wilde), a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino. A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border.  They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger, Jay (British actor Charlie Hunnam), an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again. He wants to go home for Thanksgiving, but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night. She pretends he's her brother and he pretends she's a playboy centerfold, and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker (Kate Mara), trying to prove herself in a man's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff (Treat Williams), who may be her father, but he is also a sexist, arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook, but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional. The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles, but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky, an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008's the Counterfeiters, making a very mild mew English language debut. Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean, who manages yo fit more clich&eacute;s in a ninety five minute movie than just about anyone this year. Bean's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies, and not necessarily there best parts. It's plotting, it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours, which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke, with a very special Thanksgiving twist. A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat. Eric Bana is superb in the central role, a tough guy villain that is easy to root for. Olivia Wilde proves she's much more than merely eye candy here, she is sweet, scared and sympatric in the role, she makes Liza simply more human, and this could be Wilde's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker, she's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting. She's pretty, but not glamorous, and gives a clich&eacute;d role a more firm footing in reality, or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay, a poor man's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything, he's just there as the movie's handsome stranger, a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay's folks, and Treat Williams as the sheriff, this highly capable cast really cooks. Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller, it's laughable in all the wrong ways and doesn't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie. Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner, I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here.

The common thread in the film only seems to be insane behavior with little to no explanation.After Esther loses her baby, you're introduced to her lesbian lover Anika (Kristina Klebe) who is basically a complete knockoff of Lisbeth Salander from &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&#34; Anika is covered in tattoos and a complete freak in the bedroom. This is something the film points out on more than one occasion. Anika is incredibly vindictive through and through. She enjoys Esther's company because of her craziness.Meanwhile Melanie's husband Patrick (Joe Swanberg) is not a good father. He's more infatuated with trying to come off as the &#34;cool dad&#34; than anything else. The Patrick character goes through some really funky stuff in the film. Something tragic happens to him and Melanie that affects them both. Melanie begins edging back into society while Patrick kind of retreats internally and resorts to brooding. The character begins having delusions that mostly revolve around torture. The way they haphazardly leave a shotgun lying around makes you wonder why tragedy didn't strike them sooner.If you dig a little and stretch what little substance is there, &#34;Proxy&#34; attempts to say something about people dealing with the grief of losing someone close to them, how the loss affects them, and overcoming what seems like crippling depression. But the film seems to illustrate that everyone under those conditions gives in to wrath and revenge especially when it comes to the Patrick and Anika characters.But none of the characters feel genuine. None of their actions seem like logical, real life conclusions. The film is very slow moving and bogged down from uneventful and long strings of dialogue. While &#34;Proxy&#34; is listed as a horror, it's not scary. The scariest part is getting through the entire thing. The film's highlight is a slow motion shotgun blast sequence in a bathroom, but even that is laughably bad thanks to how thick and jelly like the blood appears. &#34;Proxy&#34; only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it.",Please pass the crazy,1398470400,"04 26, 2014",1,-1

"Where to even begin with this? For starters, I guess I could say that while it is nice that females are getting leads in comedies, it is sad that Elizabeth Banks, quite a talented actress, is saddled with this kind of unfunny crap. There were some funny moments, like the opening credits, but it was all downhill from there. The plot has the thinnest of conceits: a local news anchor loses out on a job offer, and goes partying with her girlfriends. Afterwards, she meets a guy who she goes home with and after waking up, she begins her &#34;walk of shame&#34; to try and get back to her job on time. Having such a thin story acts as a double edged sword. It means we aren't saddled with a lot of narrative detours, but it also means that there really isn't much time for character development. And once the plot kicks in, it's just a series of comic set pieces, a few of which work, but most of which don't. Oftentimes, the humor they were going for was too awkward and bordered on creepy. They also gave away a lot of the best jokes in the trailer. At the end they try to make up for all of it by having Elizabeth Banks' character give a speech about how it's wrong to jazzume a girl is a whore based on what she wears. Still, it wasn't enough to erase 80 minutes of racial stereotypes and misogyny (as well as some momentary gay stereotypes). Overall, this movie was about as clich&eacute; as you can get. It was largely devoid of laughs, which is very bad for a supposed &#34;comedy.&#34; No need to shame yourself by watching this garbage, even for the few laughs it did provide.","My review of ""Walk of Shame""",1403740800,"06 26, 2014",2,-1

"The best thing I can say about this film is that there are nice shots of pretty clothes and a lovely upper cljazz English home in the early 1930's.The main character, a self absorbed wealthy young girl, is torn between the man she is about to marry and a former lover.  She is pretty in a vacuous way, but with an annoying habit of posing with her two front teeth resting on her lower lip.  I guess that's what privileged young girls did in England at that time?  Her groom to be is a handsome cheerful chap but we don't see much of him.  Who we do see ""moping about"" is last summer's boyfriend, a chinless lad with all the charm of the tortoise he gave her.  It turns out, in the only interesting scene in the film, that he may have impregnated her, in which case the child will have the worst features of both   egad!  The bride, who is supposed to be not only pretty but witty and charming  (we don't see that but we are told that she is) has the stock plain, little sister whom everyone ignores.  There are other stock characters...Miss Spoon who gets herself locked in the bathroom....a little boy who plants confetti bombs on the stuffier family members and the ""charming"" but dreadfully interfering mother (well played by Elizabeth McGovern).I suppose if I cared a whit about who this dim, blah girl eventually married I'd have enjoyed the film.

If anyone but him was the lead in this it would be unwatchable. The movie itself is so slow moving that I found it hard to stay interested in but he brought a depth to the character that really helped and made you want to see him succeed in everything he was doing. Other then that though this is just really to slow moving to recommend. Overall, a movie to watch to see the brilliance of Sam Rockwell. I give it a C+.","I watched this movie for one reason.

"Given the screenplay was co written by Lena Dunham, creator and breakout star of HBO'sGirls, I was hoping this 2012 indie relationship drama would resonate strongly like Lisa Cholodenko's acclaimed Los Angeles set films (Laurel Canyon,The Kids Are All Right), especially with such a smart cast of actors. However, something feels amiss in director Ry Russo Young's coolish approach to a familiar story of adulterous deception and family dysfunction. The pacing feels glacial, and the characters are just not that involving emotionally. Perhaps that was the intention in showing the shallow nature of the lifestyle being portrayed, but it rubs off on the film's inertia leaving it feeling quite flat. The setting is LA's funky chic Silver Lake neighborhood where sound engineer Peter lives with his psychotherapist wife Julie along with their young son and her teenaged daughter from a previous marriage, Kolt. They epitomize the laid back, everything's cool attitudes one jazzociates with affluent Southern Californians.Enter Martine, a New York acquaintance of Julie's college friend  who happens to be an attractive 23 year old experimental filmmaker. She has agreed to work as Peter's jazzistant in exchange for him helping out on her latest project, an arty video installation revolving around close ups of ants. How Martine emotionally invades the family is the crux of the story, and to the credit of Russo Young and Dunham, she never comes across as an unrepentant interloper like more commercially driven exploitative films have done in the past. It's just that the plot pretty much goes the way you would expect it would go from the outset, although the characters carry decidedly ambiguous natures that make some of the story turns feel more complex than they really need to be. For instance, the inevitable tryst between Martine and Peter lacks believable pjazzion because it feels almost matter of fact. In hindsight, I feel like it should have been the driving force in pushing each character toward self examination.The cast is not really at fault here as the acting, for the most part, is sensitive and jazzured. Olivia Thirlby (the best friend inJuno) provides the requisite gamine quality needed to make Martine credible as an object of obsession even if her character remains a cipher throughout. The always becalming Rosemarie DeWitt (Rachel Getting Married) delivers a thoughtful balancing act between earth mother and jealous wife as Julie. John Krasinski has a bit harder time escaping his amiable good guy image fromThe OfficeandAway We Go, but he does provide some surprisingly heated moments as Peter that make you wonder if he could do a greater variety of roles onscreen. As the constantly yearning Kolt, India Ennenga appears to be channeling early Claire Danes, but she makes the character's unrequited love palpable. In smaller parts, Justin Kirk as a horned up Hollywood screenwriter and Julie's attentive patient and Dylan McDermott as her self possessed ex husband bring much needed alpha energy to the proceedings. A late meltdown scene with Kolt's smarmy Italian tutor (Emanuele Secci) feels very out of place.

"I&#8217;m a big fan of zombie films.  I&#8217;ve always loved stories that have tinkered in this world wherein the dead aren&#8217;t quite dead &#8211; not, at least, the way they should be &#8211; and I think there have been many good films as well as there have been great films to explore the subject matter from a whole variety of perspectives.  What frustrates me about the smaller zombie films is almost one problem I see universally: there&#8217;s only the germ of an idea.  In other words, there really isn&#8217;t any story; rather, there&#8217;s a collection of incidents or vignettes carefully strung together in the attempt to coerce a story where there truly isn&#8217;t one.  Sure, the idea may be grand, but &#8211; lacking a legitimate through line &#8211; it&#8217;s still only an idea when the credits roll.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and or characters.  If you&#8217;re the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Depressed from a lull in her romantic life, young Samantha (played by a pleasantly fresh faced Najarra Townsend) decides to go to her friend&#8217;s party and live it up.  But a chance encounter with a possible sexual predator leaves the woman making the worst possible decision: she engages with unprotected sex with the first mysterious man she happens across.  What starts out as some mild physical discomfort suddenly warps her body into something much deadlier as she spends the next three days paying the ultimate price for a momentary lapse in judgment.OK, let&#8217;s get this out of the way up front: I know every one of us &#8211; you, me, your mom, etc. &#8211; we&#8217;ve all made a bad decision.  I&#8217;m not talking about turning right when we should&#8217;ve turned left.  I&#8217;m really more interested in those kind of decisions that we always wish we could&#8217;ve taken back.  It doesn&#8217;t have to be anything life threatening; but it&#8217;s still something we wish we could&#8217;ve done differently and saved ourselves a lot of headache, heartache, or stomach ache along the way.That said, there&#8217;s the great little germ of idea in CONTRACTED, and &#8211; the way I see it &#8211; it kinda sorta boils down to this: writer director Eric England had this clever (if not comical) idea of where zombies truly come from.  Without spoiling it (though the product packaging actually does that fairly well if you read it), let&#8217;s just say that it involves a little bit of what would be normally harmless necrophilia and one night of casual sex.Still with me?OK, right there, that&#8217;s clever.  It&#8217;s even a bit inspired.  It probably isn&#8217;t going to win any awards by itself, but it shows that some honest creative thought went into a process that ended up getting committed to celluloid, and now you&#8217;re here reading about it.Now, is that idea strong enough on its merits to sustain the interest of a 90 minute motion picture?Well, so far as this critic is concerned, England&#8217;s story here isn&#8217;t.  Sadly, there&#8217;s far too much chickified emotional baggage that firmly holds down the first half of the film as we explore Samantha&#8217;s everyday life and wade through some personal circumstances that aren&#8217;t riveting enough to have us wait for the stuff of real substance to occur.  From what I learned, she&#8217;s going through a bad break up; she&#8217;s definitely struggling with her sexuality; and she lies to a personal physician about a very private matter.  (Never a good idea, Samantha, no matter how embarrjazzing your brew up was.)  In fact, we spend so much time exploring Sam&#8217;s bad choices that, at one point, I started to wonder why we were even watching her at all &#8230; then I remembered there was that whole &#8216;contracted&#8217; illness thing that was promised in the offset, so I stuck it out.Once it becomes clear that this is no ordinary STD, then the picture elevates to appreciable heights, but that&#8217;s fairly late in the 90 minutes.  Dare I suggest what I&#8217;ve done many times before that CONTRACTED would&#8217;ve been vastly more entertaining as a short film?  It has a very TWILIGHT ZONE esque feel to all of it, and, as frightening as it was to watch poor li&#8217;l strugglin&#8217; Samantha come more and more apart psychologically she was vastly more &#8216;becoming&#8217; as a character once I knew for certain we were leaving her behind and, in her place, was something more exciting?  I mean &#8230; what does it say about us culturally when we finally uncover that, as zombies, the lives we&#8217;ll lead may be vastly more interesting than what we did as ordinary human beings?That&#8217;s the real chiller, if you ask me.  Yes, it&#8217;s a cautionary tale, but that part of it&#8217;s been done before &#8230; and much better.CONTRACTED (2013) is produced by BoulderLight Pictures and Southern Fried Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group on behalf of the IFC Midnight label of flicks.  As for the technical specifications, my suspicion is that this nifty little indie production benefitted from a respectable budget, as the picture does contain some very good quality sight and sounds as well as a good handful of practical, in camera effects and make up work.  Lastly, if it&#8217;s special features you want, then buckle up: the disc offers two separate commentary tracks as well as a &#8216;making of&#8217; short, some behind the scenes fodder (nothing all that grand there), the animated pitch, Ms. Townsend&#8217;s audition tape, and the theatrical trailer.  That is a nice package, indeed, for those wanting to know more about the world of CONTRACTED.(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  If you&#8217;re as die hard about your zombie flicks as I am, then you&#8217;re likely to sit through this despite the turgid pacing.  Methinks writer director England was trying to say something about either life or relationships or maybe even one night stands in our communicable friendly world, but I gotta say I missed it.  Instead, what I did see was a great idea poorly shackled with the emotional baggage of Katherine Heigl&#8217;s next direct to DVD stinker.  Townsend&#8217;s performance?  That&#8217;s actually pretty solid, though I&#8217;d find it hard pressed to see how her work here might open any doors for her.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with an advance DVD copy of CONTRACTED by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",One Great Li'l Idea Isn't Enough To Sustain A 90-Minute Feature,1394582400,"03 12, 2014",2,-1

Because not only is it important that we care about the characters we have to want to root for them   this clunker establishes neither.What those looking to cash in on the genre tend to do over and over is dismiss the intelligence of the audience they're playing to. We're far more both knowledgeable about what makes for good horror and what is more have a keen eye for cliche'. The film might as well have been titled ""Accident Prone In Woods"" I think even gore and splatter fans will find this movie disappointing and anyone with a decent eye, certainly any Dick Smith or Tom Savini fan will find the effects laughable at best.This is the kind of film you can walk into at any point and know immediately what you're seeing and where it's headed.

He persuades the kids with a corny scout video to the dismay of everyone and absconds with the kids to the woods. The film had potential, but didn't know which way to go. The frequency of crude humor prevented it from being a kid's film. The crude juvenile humor prevented it from becoming a good adult film. It should have appeal to an adolescent crowd, one too young for the rating.The characters are poorly developed. Leonard, whose mother coddles him, is not utilized.

If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)Jonathan Harker (played by Unax Ugalde) is summoned to the castle of the Count Dracula (an impressive Thomas Kretschmann) where he&#8217;s to begin work as the resident librarian, cataloguing all of his employer&#8217;s expansive book collection.  However, once Harker seems to have vanished, his lovely wife Mina (a pleasingly attractive Marta Gastini) follows in his footsteps, seeking to uncover the truth of her love&#8217;s disappearance.  Before all is said and done, she&#8217;ll require the services of Abraham Van Helsing (the ever reliable Rutger Hauer) to bring about an end to a vile agreement between Dracula and the townspeople he&#8217;s duped into subservience.I haven&#8217;t read Bram Stoker&#8217;s cljazzic novel (it&#8217;s on my bucket list), so I couldn&#8217;t say how faithful ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA remains to STOKER&#8217;S DRACULA.  I can say that the story certainly feels as if some minor effort went into capturing this tale as an effective but low budget period production.  Everything &#8220;looks&#8221; old age, but, by that same barometer, everyone &#8220;looks&#8221; like they&#8217;re acting, too.  For my tastes, Argento&#8217;s work is staged and photographed far too pjazzively to evoke the legitimately lurid sensibilities only effectively hinted at in a few key scenes, and, sadly, there&#8217;s just an awful lot of bloat to this work.  At nearly two hours, this version of the immortal bloodsucker is arguably thirty minutes too long.There&#8217;s far too much set up required in the tale as told, scripted by Argento and Antonio Tentori, Stefano Piani, and Enrique Cerezo (also listed as &#8216;producer&#8217;).  Lucy (Asia Argento) goes about her life in the village, secretly consorting with the leader of the vampires, and her story could&#8217;ve easily been heavily truncated to balance out the flow of the first half.  Also, there are a handful of scenes involving the locals that &#8211; while their inclusion might help establish a plot point &#8211; don&#8217;t truly add much depth to the overall narrative.  In fact, by the time Van Helsing shows up to finally go &#8216;Grandpa Bad@ss&#8217; on everyone, I&#8217;d pretty much lost interest in everyone except Dracula.Despite all of these blemishes, Kretschmann (as the Count) turns in a nice main performance.  His Dracula is only charismatic in measured doses, fleshing out the ruler of the undead by giving him some emotional layers.  This, too, unfortunately doesn&#8217;t serve the entirety of the production as strongly as it should because everyone else seems to be mimicking his delivery; far too many lines of dialogue are whispered as if they have immeasurable significance to everything, and the end result of which the melodrama gets muddled in favor of the dramatic posturing of the players.Not good, Argento.  Not good.ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA (2013) (aka DRACULA 3D) is produced by Enrique Cerezo Producciones Cinematograficas S.A., Film Export Group, and Les Films de l&#8217;Astre.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group as part of the IFC Midnight series.  As for the technical specifications, the production has plenty of quality sights and sounds, but it&#8217;s all balanced out with some inexorably long takes; at 1:52:00, it feels at times closely to 5 hours &#8230; and that&#8217;s never a good thing.  If it&#8217;s special features you want, then there&#8217;s an impressive behind the scenes documentary (1 hr.), a music video, and a few theatrical trailers: a nice package, indeed, but enough about the ladies &#8230; (snicker snicker)(MODESTLY) RECOMMENDED.  Meh.  Argento purists (or is that &#8216;cultists&#8217;?) will probably be the only audience truly excited by this release.  The rest of us?  We&#8217;ll probably be left wondering what all the excitement is about.  I can appreciate even a good vampire story, and Argento&#8217;s obvious affection for the source material shines through; but so much of this DRACULA is down for the count.  (Get it?)  Argento&#8217;s signature non blood looking blood is everywhere &#8211; at one point looking like melted crayons while still at another like cheap wine &#8211; and the absolutely unnecessary (but appreciated!) emergence of ample bosoms can only sustain a man&#8217;s interest for so long.  Worth a view, but probably only one.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MPI Media Group and IFC Midnight provided me with an advance DVD copy of ARGENTO&#8217;S DRACULA by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","When It Comes To Dracula, What's In A Name?",1390521600,"01 24, 2014",2,-1

"Disclaimer: this review contains the *OPINIONS* of the reviewer.I'd been hoping for more with this, and I felt like my expectations got shot down.To start off, I'll say what I didn't like the most about this: the lack of any trace of a comprehensive story. What we have are a bunch of middle aged guys (it's never revealed, but you get the sense they're anarchists) who, recorded (possibly accidentally) over one's own personal sex tape, record their own dangerous misdeeds (including a force flash of a young lady). Well, after a brief discussion on how they get money on a porn site for every time they get a flash recorded, one of them tells the group how they can get more money than they could imagine from finding one certain tape. What's on the tape? Why's it worth so much? Who's paying for it? Those and other questions get asked, but no real answers are given.What trace of a storyline there is in the central story, there's little more than that in each ministory. Honestly, it felt like the dialogue in each story had been crafted by college kids that didn't care about coming up with an intelligent (let alone intelligible) storyline, they just wrote what they felt like then added special effects to make it all fit. Not only excessive swearing (already making it too much like today's American horror rather than a substantial foreign horror movie), but also (in most cases) having excessive nudity (I think they only added horror elements to keep it from being labeled as ""porn""), it already made me anxious to actually want something substantial.Well, I would rate something like this 1 2 a star rather than none at all simply for nostalgia (they did get V H S technicalities and tape quirks right, I'll give them that), but I'll slightly further than that. Another 1 2 star for one segment that included a decent special effect that did impress me. The forest segment where the killer couldn't be clearly seen due to being glitched out (not only visually, but also the sound was glitched to add to the atmosphere). Beyond that, all the other special effects I couldn't pretend to have the heart to enjoy.Maybe there's a chance the sequel, S V H S, will be any better?",Dangerous Views,1355270400,"12 12, 2012",1,-1

"I think Fiction requires at least a little plausibility to work and frankly I couldn't see the group in this movie surviving a power outage, not to mention that even the most innocuous situation seems to provoke a 5 minute discussion (at times I felt like I was watching a Woody Allen film).  Discordant strings and chaotic cameras try to force thrilling atmospheres during the following anticlimaxes: the alpha nerd discovers a slashed tire, a girl with some blood on her appears at the door (sending one of the quintet into borderline shock), the mysterious visitor subsequently locks them out of their cabin (oh the humanity!).  OMG, you gotta love the 8 minute, not so riveting argument on whether to go out into the dark night and find one of the team where they finally convince his wife to wait till morning by saying ""please... help us get Doug back"" (*camera zooms in on bewildered wife, mouth agape while crickets chirp gleefully in the background*).Featuring the most spineless, indecisive and petty, horror movie victim groups of all time hunted by a slasher of epically lame proportions (ooooo... his eyes are milky white... s.s..scarrrry) ""The Killing of Jacob Marr"" comprises 1 hour 51 minutes of pure, cinematic flatulence.

"Since it was a FREE show I clicked and watched. I really tried to get into this show, being a fan of this genre and all, but nope it sucked. I will not be buying Season 2. Same ole' plot Hollywood tends to lace EVERY piece of crap movie series they create with. They can write a show about Neanderthals (cavemen) and it would be the same crap (oh wait, they did!).....I can name at least 15 movies that are EXACTLY the same as this ole' mess. Besides that, the show was very violent & bloody. I understand that Vikings were filthy disgusting uncivilized feral savages, but d@mn! I felt some kind of way, about seeing a room full of defenseless cowering &#34;Priests&#34; being butchered while crying & begging for their lives (anyone who enjoyed that, and judge me for not, is nothing but a sick sadist) Then the horrific scene at that Viking temple (good lawd!) Seriously, the &#34;fake blood&#34; expense must have accounted for a 3rd of the budget. I found nothing likable about ANY of the characters on this show.... I smh at how these Hollywood writers (as always) try to make the villains look favorable (but then this is part of the &#34;agenda&#34; to further desensitize people to violence & sexual situations). That Ragnarock (whatever his name was) and his crew were nothing but a bunch of savage serial killers & rapist. I also REALLY didn't enjoy looking at dirty sweaty greasy gross lice infested people who looked like they smelled like cattle. Whom all slept in the same beds & had sex in the same room where their children were sleeping. I keep seeing reviews comparing this show to &#34;Game of Thrones&#34;. G.O.T is messy & bloody with similar plots, but between the two, G.O.T is 5 Stars compared to this one.For all of you that feel the need to defend Viking culture & the like. If HALF of what I've read about Viking culture is true, there is absolutely NOTHING to be proud of being a descendant of these people. They were horrible violent feral savages both male & female.P.S.

"Great CGI and a compelling idea, and a great disappointment.  They could have developed so many themes from this premise. but they chose to make it a tale of emotional relationships.  All of the cliches are there: the rebellious teenage daughter, the young lovers, the Hispanic man defending his family, the clever witch, the cardboard males and the powerful women who, between running all the world knock out grown men three times their weight. This soap opera cum CGI seems suitable for teenagers and women, if they are into examining their emotions; adults interested in exploring larger questions need to be warned: this is dumber than Castle.

"I really can not say how much I couldn't stand this movie. I'm sorry but I have grown weary of writers and directors who think that they can paint themselves as artists by making an incoherent movie with characters no one cares about that flows free form from one scene to the next in an attempt to be different. You're not different you're just bad.The basic premise here is Charles Swan III (portrayed by Charlie Sheen copying his performances from TWO AND A HALF MEN and ANGER MANAGEMENT) stars as a man in love with a woman who leaves him when she discovers he has a drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of past conquests. Why he feels the need to keep these around in such an open area who knows. Distraught at her leaving he attempts to drive after her, wrecks his car and ends up in the hospital.From here the movie goes every which way it can. It moves backward and forward in time, it moves into the surreal world of Charles's mind, it bring in characters just made for cameos and it goes nowhere fast. Some reviews of this film have called it genius and others have called it one of the worst films ever made. I tend to fall in the latter group.I found it difficult just to get through a large portion of this film let alone from beginning to end. I'll be the first to admit I never got there. Something inside of me said that there were better things in this world I could be doing than watching this piece of manure posing as art. Movies like this do little but make me angry when I read about other films that have lingered on shelves for years that sounded good but never got made. Then I realize that someone gave the people behind this movie money to make it and I think why this and not that?The film was written directed by Roman Coppola who co wrote THE DARJEELING LIMITED and MOONRISE KINGDOM with director Wes Anderson. I've never been a huge fan of Anderson for many of the reasons this film didn't work, but at least I've been entertained by them in one way or another. This movie feels like it was made by a fanboy of Anderson's who wanted to show he could make just as quirky a film. Instead it falls flat on its face offering a boring film that makes no sense and is difficult to watch let alone enjoy.Don't let the cover fool you. Names like Charlie Sheen, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jason Schwartzman may be listed in the credits but I could only believe they did this movie as a favor to Coppola. They would have done him a bigger favor by telling him that yes indeed; the king wasn't wearing any clothes.",HIS MIND IS EMPTY,1369958400,"05 31, 2013",1,-1

Also this is another movie where they put two big stars on the poster, but not really in the movie. They are in it more then Bruce Willis seems to be in his movies lately but they both did about 3 days of work each. Other then that the movie is a little boring. Really full of action and comedy but I had a hard time getting into this. I'm not sure what was missing because I usually like movies like this but I really couldn't get into this.

"because I dislike when villains leave the hero conveniently alone so the hero can escape.  And how about when the Liam Neeson character was about to be taken captive and the villains kindly allowed him to place a telephone call.  Filmmakers need to make smarter villains.  There were what twenty villains, and they were all looking at telly or sleeping, when their job was to be guarding Liam and his ex wife; how do villains keep their job if they do it so poorly   not believable they were all so inept.  I did like the use of the daughter, I think she has the makings of an agent herself and hope that future sequels pursue that story line.  Dislike the editing, cut so choppily I could barely tell what's happening during the fight sequences.  Two and a half stars.Final thoughts: I think the Liam Neeson character needs to train his ex wife daughter so they at least have some defensive skills, as often as not one or both are in the thick of things in these films.  What if the Liam character gets shot; it'd be great if the women could take care of themselves or maybe even rescue him should he ever need it.

"TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about. After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS.

I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self centered and really not care for anyone.

If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community.  and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful.

Based on ABC's excellent track record this year (though they were stupid enough to cancel the reboot of Charlie's Angels, Once Upon A Time and Revenge have been major successes for the network; they should have given Charlie's Angels a shot at sticking it out), I decided to give this series a shot, but just for the pilot, as I also found out that there's a gay character on the show. Why does almost every television series have a gay character on TV these days? It's nauseating. But I digress.Watching the pilot episode of this show was like seeing my cousin on drugs. Primarily, this series makes Christians look hypocritical and superficial. Granted, there ARE some Christians like that, but not all Christians are hypocritical, superficial, judgmental, and promiscuous, as this show strongly implies they are. Jesus saith unto His disciples, Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature."" This series is doing exactly the opposite; it's spreading a bad reputation of Christians and ultimately blasphemes the Name of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour.

"(SPOILERS) documentary discusses Hollywood's transition from film to digital, i.e., how hard the movie industry fought digital, how George Lucas' tenacity helped get it established, and the mixture of emotions (some wistful) from filmmakers seeing film move out and digital move in.  In some ways, film to digital is an example of a way our species adopts new technology: someone discovers a new tool, or a better way (in the case of digital, George Lucas and his team); the established guard (Hollywood) resists, as they've invested heavily in the old technology (in terms of time, learning, and money), plus the new technology has some disadvantages (initially digital not as good visually as it is today), and the technicians, and everyone working in film, doesn't know how it works, or how to marry it with their current way of working, all of which generates fear anxiety   so they basically ignore it;  while others (who have less to lose and most to gain, i.e., Robert Rodriguez, and other young and or poor filmmakers) enthusiastically embrace it, exploiting it's advantages (real time viewing of photo capture, cheaper, and after a learning curve, ease of editing, etc.), to create their own brand of art, a significant amount of which becomes successful thus getting the attention of Hollywood who seek to emulate their success.  So now, by 2013 we see digital adopted into the Hollywood mainstream.  I'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves, which is why I wanted to see the documentary, and I'm an even bigger fan of George Lucas, who wrote my favorite film, Star Wars, A New Hope, so it was great seeing them, and all the other filmmakers and technicians talk about film.

"While I certainly wouldn't claim that the first season represented the pinnacle of acting and dialog, season 2 has somehow managed to find a way through the bottom of that barrel and plunged to new depths of poor production and ludicrous logic. It's probably no spoiler than season 1 ended with Barbie (yes, that's a guy's real name in this show) with a noose around his neck on the gallows   this is resolved in the first episode in the most uninspired, incredulous, eye rolling and ultimately lame way in seconds before they drop him to certain death. And that's the best thing that happens.Who might be the screenwriter for this first episode? Was it a second grader finishing a corrective English jazzignment or the overrated ""master of horror"" himself Stephen King? Seriously, I'm surprised he didn't introduce an author with writer's block as a lead character. This episode brings in all the worst and most repetitive tropes of King's recycled writing from the cringe inducing dialog to total disregard for character, logic and story. It's like laziest episode of The Outer Limits had an affair with a canceled daytime soap opera. It's so bad as to be completely unwatchable.Though it limped through a first season as its own concept, this show has now officially become Lost.

"Having worked her way up from second billing roles in movies such as VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA and THE TOWN, Rebecca Hall proves worthy of a lead character in the 2012 feature LAY THE FAVORITE.  She delivers an affecting performance as Beth, a career searching woman who stumbles into a job in the Las Vegas gambling business.  Not unlike the highs and lows of betting, LAY THE FAVORITE proves a zigzagging account of quick changing circumstances that can have you living in Florida, Nevada, New York and elsewhere and fall for two different people all in a blink in time, anchored by the talented young actor Hall.LAY THE FAVORITE is based on an autobiography of the same name.  Assuming this movie version takes no liberties, how funny that scenes depicting female stripping and topless sunbathing are part of Beth's true story as opposed to something made up by the men who write these films.  While Rebecca Hall stays covered up in the sunbathing scene, supporting actor Laura Prepon as fellow Vegas searcher Holly dons only lotion, typical of the risk taking roles she's done   see the grisly film KARLA.  Along with Prepon, LAY THE FAVORITE benefits from memorable acting by Bruce Willis, Wayne P&eacute;re, and a Catherine Zeta Jones I did not even recognize   she seems to have shrunk.Oh, and Rebecca Hall risks a little, too, as it is Beth who does the stripping.

"For a lot of people around a certain age our first experience with gory horror films were through old video tapes, sometimes of dubious quality, that hold cherished memories of our wayward youth and that particular moment when our fragile little minds were warped for good. So the concept of a horror anthology played out through the home video revolution of yore, is something of an inspired idea, however ideas are good, execution is where it is made or broken and unfortunately V H S  is a very mixed bag of treats, but mostly tricks.For me the found footage genre ran out of scares a Paranormal Activity or two back,this genre has been successful by promising less than it delivers. Some have been better than others, the Last Exorcism, Diary of the Dead and the original Paranormal Activity were all very good and effective little movies. V H S isn't quite in that league, but at times it is one of the better  examples of the genre, and at others it is the exemplar of everything that is wrong with it.Things get off to a fairly lousy start by having a wrap around story that is dull, uninvolving and rather intrusive on latter parts of the movie. There are five short films, about twenty minutes each, I guess because the whole endeavor runs an excessive two hours. As it is about half of it works pretty well, another quarter is just okay, while the other quarter is just plain awful.Most of the stories are a little vague, some are rather incoherent, nearly all these stories are filmed on digital, which begs the question why were they transferred onto VHS tapes in the first place. The principal characters are pretty well all douche bags and incredibly stupid, there isn't sympathetic or identifiable person in the whole film. The shaky camera photography is supposed to look like s*** and it succeeds. There is a lot more talk than action, sometimes the screen actually goes blank.Some of these shorts are made by very talented young filmmakers, Ti West is one of them. West has directed the exceptionally good old school horror movies the House of the Devil and the Innkeepers. Also David Bruckner did the solid creepfest the Signal and director Glenn McQuaid gave us the joyously lugubrious I Sell the Dead. I have no idea which films belong to whom because they all look like they came from the same quasi talented filmmaker.I love horror movies and the anthology is one of my favorite formats, it's good to see it brought out again, there aren't enough of them any more I`m sucker for this Tales From the Crpyt Creepshow Tales of Terror kind of scary movie. However, this looks like a bad flick on a poor quality tape, which I saw on high definition satellite television, bringing us full circle. If I had it on video I would have fast foreword a good deal of it.There is a fair amount of blood and gore and plentiful female nudity throughout the movie to keep our interest, and pretty much like everything else here it is only occasional succeeds. The acting is decent, I jazzume these are all professional performers, but a few are questionable. There are a few substantial scary moments and a couple of good jolts, but there is a lot to wade through here. I'm not sure it is worth the effort for anyone who is not the most ardent fan of such of things to begin with.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",anthologies often offers mixed grab bag of horror,1362700800,"03 8, 2013",3,0

"Here's another promising show that got short shrift from the television network. PARADOX aired across the pond in 2009 on the BBC. Set and shot in Manchester, England, this DVD package is appropriately of a Region 2 persuasion. Too bad the show's deaders. When you've got British sci fi television fare as freewheeling and in your face as DOCTOR WHO, TORCHWOOD, and PRIMEVAL, it's difficult to compete when your schtick is plodding police procedural and slow burn gratification. LIFE ON MARS, a fellow sci fi police drama, was able to get away with a minimalist sci fi premise. But PARADOX was too stingy for too long with reveals concerning those overarching conundrums. The plug was pulled before it found its audience. Like me. I stumbled across it in tardy fashion. Maybe there isn't a Subway franchise in Britain with which its fans can launch a last ditch save the show campaign.There are elements here of 24 and FlashForward and even MINORITY REPORT. It offers plenty of mind warping philosophical and moral quandaries for us to wrap our heads around. Only, I wish there were more of them water cooler moments. Me springing from common denominator viewership, I don't get upset when you ding my brain pan with questions of morality and proper ethics and quantum mechanics, but you best give me the fancy explosions as well. I am shallow and, sad to say, folks like me are legion. In my eyes, PARADOX needed a bit more flash and a more accelerated pace.Five hour long episodes, totaling 294 minutes, comprise the entire series, and the first episode does offer fireworks. At 2:33am, a series of fragmented images, revealing a mjazzive explosion, are transmitted from the depths of outer space, manifesting on the display screen of space physicist Christian King (Emun Elliott). But the time stamp on the images suggests that the catastrophic event has yet to happen, eighteen hours away. Now a team of police investigators, eyebrows skeptically arched and led by DI Rebecca Flint (a commanding Tamzin Outhwaite), must race against time to avert a potential disaster. As they analyze the mysterious images for long shot leads, it gradually dawns on them that maybe, just maybe, this isn't a prank, that perhaps these images are really from the future. Some react to this epiphany with wide eyed wonder and excitement. Some are absolutely horrified.Besides the space scientist's dubious jazzistance   Dr. King is a distant and disdainful git   DI Flint is supported by straight arrow DC Callum Gada (Chike Okonkwo) and loose cannon DS Ben Holt (Mark Bonnar), Flint's off again, on again flame. There's a chance that PARADOX over indulges on the juicy soap opera elements. It's interesting, though, that further episodes go on to challenge the viewer's initial perception of these characters. As the investigating team learns, there's nothing like being exposed to the truth of predestination to rock your foundations and shift your beliefs some. I love that the climax to the first episode doesn't give us the ending we expect. This adds a fascinating dimension of uncertainty to the show. And as a tease to the second episode, we glimpse a new batch of disturbing images streaming on the space scientist's screen.I happen to love this particular sci fi gimmick. This isn't time travel, but it's the next best thing: a dark message from the future. These five episodes raise those familiar questions: Is the future set in stone? By attempting to change the future, do you, in effect, bring about the very event you were trying to change? These questions have been explored before in other similar shows; there's nothing really new here, from that aspect. Part of the fun is in piecing these fragmented images together so that they finally coalesce into a cohesive narrative. Intriguingly, the team won't have a 100% success rate. I did enjoy the characters' frequently adversarial interactions and the arcs they individually undergo, and how very quickly they venture beyond their lawful jurisdiction. What dropped the ball for me was the plodding pace and the unimaginative police procedural bits. And because the ratings were utterly dismal, PARADOX, lacking enough of those fancy bells and whistles, got the axe before we learn the secrets behind it all. Where do these images originate from? What does it mean when a future suggested by these images is thwarted? How does episode five's bloody cliffhanger ending resolve? You'll just have to shrug it off and move on. If you're one of them types what gets fixated on stuff like that, then I don't recommend trying out PARADOX.

I did not find her character engaging in the least.There are a host of movies that have done similar base stories to her character and many have done it far better.The secondary story with the android child is nothing more than an A.I. rehash with a slightly darker overtone.I will probably binge watch this series when the full season comes on Amazon Prime or Netflix, but I won't waste money purchasing it now.Given the producers involved this should have been much, much more than a rehash of previously done sci fi.",Simply not impressed,1405296000,"07 14, 2014",3,0

Secondly, typical British weirdness with the nudity.

"Having read through the rest of the reviews, I can say that I agree with most of what was written and so shall not expand on the positive parts of the show.  However, I had to dock the show a couple of stars for lack of character development.To explain my reasoning: Josh and Sally in particular have not developed at all (in my opinion) during all 3 seasons. I find myself gritting my teeth like a mother with two 3 year old kids in the house who just cant seem to quiet down for a minute. Sally still has the bad habit of wanting to toss her *fairly petty* problems onto Josh and Aidan, many times without reading the mood because both of them come home in a shabby state usually just having pjazzed through a horrible experience. I find her lack of empathy disturbing. Josh   well what can I say about Josh.. He has 1 day a month when he turns. Listening to him go on and on about being a werewolf.. blah blah blah blah blah. He still hasn't gotten to the point where he can say ""I have a rental box to change in, everything's fine.""  Aidan has to fight his thirst every day of the darn year, yet Josh and Sally seem oblivious to it, depending on him for (far too much) emotional support. Also, listening to Josh lay on the guilt trip when Aidan slips up and turns or kills a human.. He's a VAMPIRE. A true friend would help clean up the mess.I would have given this more stars, had Josh and Sally grown up a little from the pity party they are throwing themselves. Listening to Josh go on and on with his panic attacks while trying to revive Sally..

"I had a lot of trouble just making out the dialogue either because of the audio quality, the particular British accents the actors adopted, and or my own aging ears, but on the other hand, what's going on is pretty self evident.  Two former military buddies get together to collaborate on working as professional hitmen because they need the money and one of them has to live down a botched job in Kiev.  He brutally kills a number of allegedly bad people as if to make up for his previous slip up, until the two of them run into a bit of a pickle in the end (to say the least).  In between all the blood and guts spilled, the men act like normal if a bit neurotic blokes, one of them with an unbelievably loyal wife and kid and the other with an attractive but mysterious girlfriend with an apparent penchant for witchery of the black kind.It's not the kind of film that I normally watch because of the gore and violence level, but it features excellent acting, very effective background music, and sickeningly realistic special effects.  It's kind of like a Quentin Tarantino film on steroids. I wouldn't recommend it except to those with a strong stomach, so I'm only giving it three stars.","Chilling, revolting, incoherent",1392595200,"02 17, 2014",3,0

"This grande Superman tale penned by the mind of Marc Millar is arguably one of his best works. And to see Dave Johnson & Kilian Plunkett's art brought life with the subtle fluidity of motion comics is just great. Dc's Elseworlds imprint was always an innovative breeding ground for fresh new stories & interpretations on cljazzic characters. In ""Red Son"", it isn't just an alternate Superman tale but more importantly an alternate world where we see familiar characters & history itself re imagined. And it's all done so wonderfully! I don't give this the full 5 star rating because the episodes aren't broken down into just one long film. So instead you have to fast forward or skip every time the 5 minute episode ends to get to the next one. It's pretty annoying unless you don't mind hearing the theme music & watching ending credits each time one episode ends. That & there aren't any special features whatsoever, which is quite strange because this was a cool endeavor & seeing the making of it would've been a blast.

"MINOR SPOILERS:I am a big fan of Tricia Helfer from Battlestar Galactica, Chuck et al.  However, the aforementioned opening scene along with Ms. Helfer stripping down on several occasions, was essentially all that was compelling about the first episode of Killer Women (KW).Yes, there was an explosion and some other jazzorted violence, which seemed contrived.  Also, Episode 1 started to lay the ground work for back stories:1.) A soon to be ex abusive husband2.) A budding romance with a DEA Agent3.)

Alternative titles:Buffy's Who Kill!Felons in Thongs!Babes Gone Bad!Guns, Girls & Gorgeous Cops!She's So Good With Her Stiletto!There was nothing in episode 1 to validate the marketing hype for the series.  Will I watch future episodes for the eye candy alone (ladies, the guys are attractive as well)?  Perhaps, though unless the storylines picks up, to keep my interest, I am going to need to see progressively less clothing on Ms. Helfer et al and perhaps even a shift off the network to Cinemax late night.","Opening With Nadine Velasquez In A Skin Tight Red Dress was Brilliant!

"Yes, the film&#8217;s premise seems controversial enough. Two childhood friends Roz (Robin Wright) and Lil (Naomi Watts), now middle aged, start to have sexual affairs with each other's son Ian (Xavier Samuel) and Tom (James Frecheville). However, while some find the story of this Australian French film very provocative, I find it pretty boring.In short, despite its unusual subject matter, the film itself is too tame. Based on a novella &#8220;The Grandmothers&#8221; by a Nobel Prize winner Doris Lessing, and adapted by Christopher Hampton, &#8220;Adore&#8221; (aka. &#8220;Two Mothers&#8221;), the film obviously wants to be taken seriously, even though most characters are shallow at best, and storytelling perfunctory.Directed by Anne Fontaine, &#8220;Adore&#8221; lacks insight into the characters&#8217; relationships, especially that of love between a (younger) man and (older) woman. Two young actors are decent, but still fail to live up to the level of Robin Wright and Naomi Watt, who are both excellent, providing a credible portrayal of the bond between two lifelong friends (that seems even stronger than anything else).In fact, those two talented players Robin Wright and Naomi Watt (and perhaps Australia&#8217;s beautiful sea) are the only reason that you should watch &#8220;Adore.&#8221; They are fascinating, but not the story.","Fine Acting, Weak Storytelling",1405036800,"07 11, 2014",3,0

"I never turn down a chance to see a post apocalyptic sci fi adventure film. However, I become a bit more leery whenever I learn that the film is based on a video or role playing game. Very few cinematic adaptations have done justice to the source. Off the top of my head, the cream of the crop number the LARA CROFT and RESIDENT EVIL series. DOOM, MORTAL KOMBAT, and SILENT HILL tend to fall under the umbrella of so so adaptations. And then you've got bottom of the barrel picks like MAX PAYNE, ALONE IN THE DARK, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, STREET FIGHTER, BLOODRAYNE, etc.And then there's MUTANT CHRONICLES, a doom and gloom Indie sci fi film co starring Thomas Jane, Ron Perlman, and an apathetic John Malkovich. The cool premise, intense worldbuilding and internal mythology, and brutal violence induce me to give it a thumbs up. The poor execution, the monotone delivery of dialogue (shout out to Malkovich!), the laughable attempts at character development, and the sheer oppressive tediousness of the thing reluctantly convince me to give it the finger.At the end of the Ice Age the Machine came from outer space with the sole purpose of converting mankind into mutants. After much struggle and bloodshed a mjazzive seal was placed on the Machine, and for thousands of years it lay dormant. In the distant future, in the 28th Century, four warring mega corporations hold dominion over a ravaged planet. But one brutal skirmish in the trenches between two corporations cracks open the great seal and soon ghoulish mutants erupt from the bowels of the earth and very quickly overrun civilization, forcing the remnants of humanity to flee to otherplanetary colonies   providing they come up with the rare transport ticket. A grizzled warrior monk from an ancient brotherhood gathers an elite team of soldiers and descends underground with the intent of putting an end to the infernal Machine once and for all. They bring with them a tome of prophesy and an ancient device which they think is a bomb. It's not a bomb.The film is relentless with its violence and gore, even though the crack troop pretty much frags over and over the same six actors who, rumor has it, portrayed the hordes of mutants. It helps that these lobster pincered freaks lack individuality and look the same. But the fight scenes are pretty cool, and I wish the silent monk warrior girl had more chances to swing that sword of hers. She's the jazzigned protector of the Book of Chronicles. And, no, she doesn't know how to read the thing, but she sure protects the shizzy out of it!But the movie collapses under the weight of its taking itself too seriously, at being too solemn, and it doesn't get much support from a story that is lacking, cinematography that is depressingly gritty and monochromatic, and actors who turn in B movie performances. All the religious babblepalooza doesn't help, either.Ron Perlman is decent as the warrior monk Brother Samuel, but he doesn't bring his best stuff. Thomas Jane who plays the tough as nails Sgt. John Mitchell Hunter seems to be positioning himself as the next Christopher Lambert. The rest of the cast aren't developed enough. There's a listless cameo from John Malkovich who I guess just couldn't be bothered. He drones out lame lines like ""The absence of gravity interferes with my digestion."" Man, what's happened to you, John Malkovich? You used to bring it, even if you were always on the quirky side.As mentioned, the look of the film may be gritty and monochromatic, but, on second thought, it really doesn't bug me that much. Overall, I have no problems with the special effects. A comment from the DVD's special features informs us that the CG work was heavily bolstered by old school f x techniques (matte paintings, make up, and miniatures, etc.). The film imagines a grimy steampunk sort of technology, and it's kind of neat that the machines in this world rely heavily on coal power.I missed this during its theatrical release, but I had hopes, so I got the 2 disc set, in which lurks an abundance of bonus features. Disc 1 offers the widescreen presentation, as well as audio commentary by Ron Perlman and Director Simon Hunter. Disc 2 has the following: the extensive Making Of documentary (107:25 minutes); six deleted scenes, all of which if inserted would've dragged the pace even more (7:49 minutes); Green Screen & Storyboard Comparisons for three scenes (13:57 minutes); the promotional teaser short film with optional Director's commentary (7:15 minutes); the Making Of the promotional teaser short film (3:26 minutes); a heck of a lot of short interviews with the cast & crew; HDNet: A Look at MUTANT CHRONICLES   a look at the world and characters of MUTANT CHRONICLES (4:40); 94 slides of Storyboard art; Concept Art (50 illustrations); Visual Effects (2:48); MUTANT CHRONICLES Panel Q&A; from the 2009 San Diego ComicCon, the end of which has Ron Perlman thinking that the crowd was laughing at him but, really, the chuckles were for Thomas Jane who just couldn't stop slamming down gljazz after gljazz of water (11:35); 12 brief webisodes mostly exploring the characters in the film; and the trailer to the thing.As at least one other reviewer had mentioned, the first half hour or so crawls like a mother. But it picks up once the suicide mission team is jazzembled. I'm almost tempted to recommend this movie because it has its share of cool elements. But ultimately the downside tilted the balance to the other direction. So, 2.5 out of 5 stars for MUTANT CHRONICLES. Not quite worth purchasing, but it makes for a nice rental or cable viewing.

"As a longtime fan of Stephen King, I went into TV's ""Under the Dome"" with an open mind, knowing ahead of time that many changes would be made to the original story.  What I didn't realize was that the writers' intention was to keep the most basic elements in place, then write an entirely new story that bears only minimal resemblance to the book.  Here's a laundry list of changes that I see an either unnecessary or downright absurd, followed by what I think is good about the show:1.)  Linda Everett from part time cop married to physician's jazzistant Rusty Everett, both trapped under the dome,  to Linda Esquivel, Hispanic female police officer in a small Maine town (??) engaged to firefighter Rusty Denton who gets caught outside the dome.2.)  Phil Bushey from zombified meth cook known as the Chef who hides out in an automated religious radio station to a popular contemporary radio DJ with ambiguous ties to the gambling underworld (???).3.)  Junior Rennie from a disturbed, homicidal psychopath with a brain tumor who sleeps with women after he kills them, and who secretly despises his father, to a slightly off in the head, somewhat psychotic, but also sometimes strangely reasonable young man who craves his father's admiration and respect.4.)  Big Jim Rennie from a Christ driven mini dictator who never curses to a slightly religious minded mini dictator who swears lightly.5.)  Julia Shumway from lifelong small town newspaper editor to disgraced out of towner who scrapes up a job in Chester's Mill.6.)  Thurston Marshall and Carolyn Sturges from a May December tourist couple who find two young dome orphans named Alice and Aidan, to Alice and Carolyn Hill, a lesbian couple from L.A. who are in Maine to drop off their daughter, Norrie, at a girl's reformatory.  (?????)7.)  Norrie Calvert from town ""riot grrrl"" who is friends with Joe and Benny to the daughter of the aforementioned lesbian couple.8.)  Dale Barbara from fry cook with a troubled military past to mercenary with a troubled military past who roughs up people with gambling debts.  (??????)9.)  Angie McCain from pot head waitress at the Sweetbriar who gets murdered by Junior to Angie McCallister, Joe's big sister, who gets locked in the Rennie fall out shelter by Junior, then becomes Big Jim's blackmail pawn against his son.10.)  Dodee Sanders from pot head friend of Angie who also gets murdered by Junior to Dodee Weaver, radio sound engineer and co worker of Phil Bushey who gets murdered by Big Jim for knowing too much.  (?????)11.)  Andrea Grinnell from the town's Third Selectman who makes Big Jim's railroading of Chester's Mill more difficult to concerned citizen who has no importance to the plot.12.)  Pete Randolph from clueless cop promoted to chief to Paul Randolph, crazed deputy who fires shots at the dome and kills one his fellow officers, then leads the town on a manhunt through the woods.13.)  No Andy Sanders (town First Selectman and Big Jim's scapegoat in the book), no Carter, Frank, Mel, and Georgia (the rapist deputies), no Brenda Perkins, no Sammy Bushey, no Reverend Piper Libby, no Romeo Burpee...basically, all subplots from the book eliminated.Those are just some of the character changes, which don't even scratch the surface of the differences in the plot.  For instance, in the most inept stab at a plot twist I've seen on any show, a new character, Maxine, is created.  She's a femme fatale crime kingpin (who looks all of about 25 years old) who gets caught in the Mill, has illicit ties to both Barbie and Big Jim, and begins running a fight club to make money after the dome drops.  Can I just say .... BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!  Okay, now that I got that out of my system, I'll follow it up with a heaving sigh at the inane butchering of a pretty good book.  As for other changes, you have to ask, was it better in the book, or is the show an improvement?  Take the case of Officer Randolph.  In the book, a young boy drives at the dome on an ATV during a town gathering, shoots it, and blows out his own eye.  That's replaced by Randolph shooting the dome after the town pitches in to put out a fire and accidentally killing another officer.  Personally, I think the book version is more horrific and compelling.Two more quick notes on changes.  One, the death of Reverend Lester Coggins is far more dramatic and intense in the book, with Big Jim and his son teaming up to finish off the meddling minister in their house.  On the show, Rennie smashes Coggins's head into the dome and it's over.  Lame in comparison.  Second, the show offers the source of the dome as a mini dome with an egg inside that the teens find in the woods, then they carry it around, hide it in barns and friends' bedrooms, find secret magic spots on it that are like keypads for their hands, find a butterfly inside, see the pink falling stars from the book, put sungljazzes on it and take it to parties .... okay, that last one was ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" but you get the picture.On the plus side, a handful of actors stand out.  Obviously, Dean Norris as Big Jim is a highlight, Mike Vogel does well as Barbie, and the characters of Julia Shumway and Officer Linda Esquivel are mostly good.  Other than that, though, much of the acting gets annoying, especially the girl playing Norrie Calvert.  The seizure scenes she shares with Scarecrow Joe look like something you'd see in a comedy.  Ridiculous conceits, like Big Jim several times dispersing scared, angry crowds made up of the whole town, by saying things like, ""Everybody go on home and let us take care of things,"" then the crowd just drifts away...these moments pop up frequently.  Political sermonizing, like Carolyn telling a skeptical farmer something like, ""We're a gay couple with a daughter, welcome to the 21st century"" pop up seemingly to push an ulterior agenda and inspire mjazzive eye rolling.  Only a few of the book's original plot ideas remain in place for this show, and its saving grace is the suspenseful way the plot is presented, making expert use of today's propensity for serialized TV drama.  Also, even though so much of the plot is different from the book, I do find at least more than half of it compelling and suspenseful, such as the showdown between Big Jim and farmer Ollie Dinsmore, Big Jim's complex relationship with his son....actually, now that I think about it, just about all of the plotlines that focus on Big Jim, as Dean Norris is hands down the best actor in this series.I'll be tuning in and hoping beyond hope that some positive changes are made when Season 2 premieres next summer, but right now, I'm worried that the writers will continue re imagining so much of the story that they ruin it with droll like the Maxine character and subplot.  If they find a way to right the ship, make the changes work, and bring the story back to some similarity to the book (which I didn't see anything wrong with, anyway), I'll come back and upgrade this review.

"Feminist filmmaker Mary Harron has made some bold and provocative choices in past films such as ""I Shot Andy Warhol,"" ""American Psycho"" and ""The Notorious Bettie Page."" She is not afraid to push things to the edge of reason and watch them topple over with an in your face glee. So I'm shocked by the tepid and somewhat unfocused ""The Moth Diaries."" The film seems to be borne of some interesting ideas, but it never effectively builds in intensity. The picture is lovely, to be sure, with breathy performances, gauzy flashbacks and ethereal fantasy sequences  but does it amount to much? I didn't think so. Pretty, but empty. That's the first phrase that popped into my head as the credits started to roll. Taking a popular young adult novel by Rachel Klein, Harron's choices here appear content to ape the underdeveloped emotions inherent in the Twilight saga as opposed to creating something that felt distinct or unique.Set in an all girl boarding school, ""The Moth Diaries"" opens with an introduction to Rebecca (Sarah Bolger). A troubled girl rebuilding her life after a tragedy, she is really getting back into the swing of things with a close knit group of friends. A creepy new student (Lily Cole) starts to worm her way into the group and strange occurrences abound. Is Rebecca justifiably suspicious of the new girl? Or might it just be jealousy? After all, she is losing her best friend's devotion to this exotic new rival. With vampire allusions aplenty and some seemingly supernatural sightings, we're left to wonder what is real and what might be the imaginings of the increasingly distraught Rebecca. The solution, when it arrives, is neither particularly shocking or even interesting. As the entire film unfolds in one monotonous dimension, no suspense is ever really derived from the tale.I think the fundamental issue is that lack of adequate character development. All of the girls (and even the staff) start to be affected, but I wasn't invested in any of them. As such, it became hard to care about their respective fates. It doesn't help that the picture has a sporadic (and deadly wooden) narration by Bolger or that a poorly handled subplot involving a male teacher (the likable Scott Speedman) halts the forward momentum of the narrative. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of the film is the Sapphic subtext as the girls form unnaturally close bonds. As alluded to in the movie, gothic tales such as this always have sex, death, and blood. After proclaiming this, though, the movie shies away from this aspect and leaves it largely unexplored. Harron opted to stay in the tween angst realm in this adaptation and the movie lacks an edginess that might have upped the danger and excitement. I didn't hate ""The Moth Diaries,"" if anything I'm apathetic about it. It might very well have made a great movie, but everything feels thoroughly undercooked. About 2 1 2 stars.

"This is a rather pointless ""horror"" film.A group of 20 somethings are out in the woods, some long distance from the road to clear an area for a large camp site for kids...one you can't reach by car. The cast introduce themselves as a way to quickly build character. As they clear the woods, accidents happen and this thing turns into a ""ten little Indians"" tale for no rhyme or reason.The acting was decent. The dialouge was well written. The plot flowed rather well in spite of some issues, but there was no substance to the story...or maybe I am missing something. Some films are made better by not explaining what happened (Yellow Brick Road), but it didn't work for me in this one. After watching a fairly decent film, I was let down by the ending, the last scene which caused me to laugh (by design). The closeups of the chainsaw showed it didn't have a chain but a serrated blade made to look like chain.The land was donated by a family whose little girl was murdered, which didn't really enter the film. Apparently the land they are on is cursed, but by what and why? Did the girl being killed curse the land or was that because of it? Or was one of the campers cursed or a victim of it? Or was it all fate? The film will need a sequel to explain this one.Parental Guide: F bombs, near sex, nudity (Grindhouse girl Emmy Robbin)Safety Note: If you have something embedded in you, like a stick, the proper first aid is to stabilize the item and seek medical attention.

"While the series did provide entertainment you could get quickly lost on what was happening as the producers played majorly with the usual time paradoxes and future selves past selves scenarios where if you didn't pay close attention you'd quickly be thinking ""What The Hell??!!"".

Some of the characters they brought in as new villains was enjoyable but again it quickly fizzles out too, and some of the main characters felt like they were just eye candy for the cameras mostly with the actress Ali Larter whose character in the third season seemed unnecessary and unneeded.  The actor for Sylar though plays the role very well so there wasn't any complaints on him or most of the other main cast either, again it just seems the writers were trying to put to much into each episode without fully thinking things through on how the finished product would really look on t.v.

Melissa George acts pretty casual about the strange things going on as well.

Perhaps this is due to the fact that Jaa abandoned the set and ventured into the woods for two months or so, bringing filming to a halt.

"Throughout this film I kept wondering, &#34;Just who is this family? What is this all about?&#34;  'All Good Things' is a story taken from true life. A wealthy real estate dealer and his two sons live in a large mansion in Long Island. It appears the mother committed suicide, and one would surmise that one reason is the father Sanford Marks, played by Frank Langella.. A mean often vicious man who always gets what he wants, no overtly physical abuse, but plenty of emotional abuse is apparent.David Marks, played by Ryan Gosling,  the younger son seems meek and mild and has no interest in his father's family business. He meets a young woman Katie, played by Kirsten Dunst, they marry, go off to Vermont and set up an organic food store, 'All Good Things', where they are very happy. Enters dad, telling them he will no longer support this lifestyle and they move back to New York. It is here that things fall apart. David is lifeless and listless, Katie goes onto college wanting to become a physician. But time takes it's toll, the marriage falls apart and Katie goes missing.Kirsten Dunst plays this role to the hilt, as a woman at a loss to understand who her husband really is, and I had the same question throughout the film. Who is David, really? . The man we first met, the man she married has completely changed. Was he hiding some sort of psychotic imbalance? The rest of the film is creepy in a sense. We view the film from different episodes, past and present. Ryan Gosling certainly plays this character well, keeping us and himself off balance. The fact that this is a true story is eerily chilly.Recommended For Those Who Enjoy Suspense And Confusion.  prisrob 01 19 14",Confusingly Suspenseful,1390089600,"01 19, 2014",3,0

"Dollhouse is what happens when networks have bad ideas, and then hire good writers to carry them out.Bad idea #1: Signing Eliza Dushku for her own show.  Face it, Dushku can't act.

And why have the same person do all these things, in public, if you need to keep the whole operation secret?Bad idea #3: High heels.

"While I consider myself a pretty solid sci fi junkie, I'll have to admit to some ignorance to all things SANCTUARY.  I distinctly remember watching the series pilot episode, as well as a handful of episodes from their first season.  The only lasting impression I can cull from memory is that I wasn't impressed enough to hang with it   after all, time is our most perishable resource.  I didn't find the characters early on all that interesting, and, while I enjoyed the premise of the show, it just seemed like it would have limited flexibility so far as any longer story arcs were concerned.  I pride myself on entertainment that requires some measure of investment on the part of the viewer   no matter how small   and early SANCTUARY, for whatever reasons, just didn't do it for me.So, I watched SANCTUARY: THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON in its entirety, figuring I could come at it from the perspective of a `newbie,' someone who might have a little bit to add critically by being an outsider.  I'm safe admitting that this fourth season really didn't convince me that my original perception was all that far off the mark; in fact, I'd mostly say that early jazzessment was vindicated.Dr. Helen Magnus (played by the lovely Amanda Tapping) uses her creative cunning and scientific mind to track down and secure the monsters that live above us.  No, I'm not talking serial killers, unless the serial killing is a raving carnivore with a fur covered body, claws, and the eyes of a mutant.  These are monsters   literal monsters   of the sci fi and monster movie variety.  Along with her counterparts, Dr. Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), wolf thing Henry Foss (Ryan Robbins), and Bigfoot (Christopher Heyerdahl), her weekly installments took her anywhere around the world where CGI could lead, the cutting edge visual special effect which the program made impressive use of regularly.In fact, I'd read somewhere that CGI was SANCTUARY's saving grace.  CGI could be used to great effect in studios to create the settings and locales needed to tell these monster stories.  And use it they did!  SANCTUARY, in its four seasons, has been nominated and won accolades consistently.  This crew has been recognized for excellence in series direction, special effects, costuming, sound, and acting.  If there's an award out there for a sci fi TV production, SANCTUARY has no doubt been in contention for it, and that alone speaks wonders for the work these smilers have done over the years.The central problem I had with the program was that, at its core, I just didn't care about these characters.  Growing up, I was a huge fan of monster movies, and I've probably forgotten more hours that I can honestly remember watching any film that came on television that had a monster.  Even if that monster was in an `Abbott & Costello' flick, I was there   not for the comedy, but for the monsters.  SANCTUARY was, probably, the type of show created with me in mind.  So far as I can tell, I must've grown a little too jaded and maybe a little too disinterested with monsters these days to be interested in following the program with any serious eye.  What I saw when I watched this fourth season was still a program dedicated to these four leads   all a little too goody two shoes saccharin for my palate   and their various exploits that just HAPPENED to involve monsters.  Instead of focusing on the monsters, SANCTUARY told me how these people `felt' and `capture' and `caught' and `explored' monsters.  What I wanted to see was more about monsters and less about these people.However, I honestly contend that, if I were that eight, nine, and ten year old boy again, then I probably would've loved SANCTUARY.  The series pilot and quite a bit of this fourth season had an immensely `friendly' environment for children.  Clearly, the central premise of the show was that as much as mankind needing protection so did these monsters, and that's a message any kid with a thing for monsters can grasp, understand, and appreciate.  Whereas the older, (hopefully) more mature viewer I've grown into gets jazzed about even re runs of THE X FILES, SANCTUARY seems to me very much like THE X FILES FOR KIDS, and, on that front, I applaud their efforts.Quality wise, the first few episodes of this fourth (and final) season were actually very compelling.  These few dealt with Magnus's departure from the third season (and, no, I wasn't at a loss to follow it all even though I hadn't seen so much as ten seconds of the third season), as she's slipped back in time all under the machinations of a monster she's bent on capturing.  Once she did, she found herself lost in time, missing all of the resources of her impressive `Sanctuary' network, but it was all righted (maybe a little too cleanly) within a matter of installments.  The latter half of the season, I felt the quality dipped quite a bit, almost as if the creative staff were struggling to find a way to tie all of the threads they'd dangled   the loss of funding for the Sanctuary, the pregnancy of a recurring character, an entire society of subterranean creatures   into a cohesive plotline that they could tie up before the season finale.  Again, for my tastes, it didn't work all that well   much of the relationships were obviously deliberately thrown into disarray, friendships were broken   and it resolved itself with even less grace under pressure.Still, while not a regular viewer, I enjoyed it for what it was ... except that all musical episode.  Really?  Really?  Why must EVERY respectable genre program these days HAVE to HAVE a musical episode?THAT's a real monster!SANCTUARY: THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON was produced by Sanctuary 1 Productions and Stage 3 Media.  DVD distribution is being handled by E1 Entertainment (aka Entertainment One).  The DVD looks and sounds excellent; it's pretty clear that the producers spared no modest expense at cultivating the look of the program   lots and lots of CGI done in some large, expansive set formats   and I can only guess that fans loved how it all went together so seamlessly.  As a set, the discs also boast an impressive amount of special features, including a `day in the life' with series star Amanda Tapping, a few `making of' exposes, the usual bloopers outtakes gags, deleted scenes, and audio commentaries provided by acting and behind the scenes personnel.  I would imagine that any fan of the program or maybe even fans of even TV production might learn a thing or two by investing some time in the material presented here.RECOMMENDED (obviously) for fans of the series, folks who like `lighter' sci fi fare, and it's definitely kid friendly (maybe on purpose?).  SANCTUARY offers up few legitimate scares, though it reaches more than a few times to be heavier.  Still, the best it did for me was show me some pretty special effects alongside some pretty people and pretty monsters all a bit too safely for my tastes.  The latter episodes felt a bit rushed   did they know it was their last season?   and, as a result, they lose their narrative focus.  As I'm not a long time fan of the show (this was my first significant exposure to it), I couldn't comment on whether or not the finale served as a satisfying wrap up to all that the showrunners hoped and promised: my gut instinct is that it didn't, but those who followed it more closely could probably tell you otherwise.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at EOne (Entertainment One) provided me with a DVD screener of SANCTUARY: THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON for the expressed purposes of writing this review.",SANCTUARY Became Its Own Little Monster,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",3,0

"The Spanish UK French film ""Oxford Murders"" (based on a Guillermo Mart&iacute;nez book) follows the cases of mathematically linked murders in Oxford, starring John Hurt as famous mathematics professor Arthur Seldom, and Elijah Wood as Martin, an American grad student who admires Seldom. After stumbling upon a murder ""simultaneously,"" the old professor and the young student become partners to solve the case, using their academic knowledge.Meanwhile, Martin meets two beautiful women, both very attractive in totally different ways. One is Beth (Julie Cox), a cellist and daughter of the landlady Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Mjazzey), and the other Lorna (Leonor Watling), a Spanish nurse working at the hospital.&Aacute;lex de la Iglesia, known for his cult films like ""Perdita Durango (Dance With The Devil),"" is the director and he employed an orthodox approach to the material this time. Maybe too orthodox, or too familiar. With its convoluted plotline, ""Oxford Murders"" sometimes feels like a Dan Brown novel. The pace is slower, however, and the film's ""truth"" is more unbelievable than what Robert Langdon finds out.Actually, implausible storyline is not a bad thing as long as it keeps us entertained, but philosophical discourse and occasional discussion about cryptic symbols are not enough to make a film interesting. Some characters are lifeless, making the film's romantic subplot more incredible than the whole story.""Oxford Murders"" certainly makes a point about the way we try to understand things around us, but by the time truth is uncovered, few of us would be still interested in it.","""Oxford Murders"": Mystery or Lecture?",1285545600,"09 27, 2010",3,0

"I've come to expect anodyne pabulum with the illusion of depth from science fiction.  Defiance gives the appearance of something different, but it really isn't.There's a theme of cultural relativism, but in reality, the aliens are all way too similar in motivation to humans for this theme to work.  There's a bunch of goofy songs and ceremonies that are cringe worthy and the motorcycle gang has a guy wearing Slash's pilgrim hat which is just embarrjazzing.  The juxtaposition of aliens driving vintage cars is intentional, but it's just too obvious to be entertaining.  You feel like you're watching a bad SNL skit at times.Every alien race is humanoid   Jaime Murray is painted white and walks around half naked.  What are the chances that another planet would evolve a white human with a perfect body and perfect teeth (she played a meth addict in Dexter?!?)  From Farscape's Rockne S. O'bannon, I was expecting a flying frog at the very least!The mayor is miscast and it sounds like she's been huffing helium.  Her sister runs the town brothel and guess who she serviced in the first episode?  It's either a delicious love triangle or horrible writing depending on your age and intelligence.The kids from the two most powerful families are in love in Alien Romeo and Juliet fashion.  Neither parents approve initially.  Again, either a delicious forbidden romance or horrible and hackneyed writing depending on your age and intelligence.Incidentally, the boy in that romeo and juliet rip off has a radio broadcast at the top of the Arch   just like the Woody Allen obsessed DJ from Northern Exposure.  Besides sounding like a mjazzive tool, that white skinned and golden eyed douche's broadcasts makes me wince at just how derivative, hokey, and hackneyed the series is.They end many episodes with a pop culture song that comes off as gimmicky.  For instance, in episode two, they play Nirvana's 'come as you are' with a slowed tempo and you notice how nonsensical the heroin inspired lyrics are.  This could have been intentional to highlight the senseless barbarity of the final few minutes of the episode, but for me it just didn't work and reminded me of the final minutes of each Flashpoint episode which I always fast forwarded through.There were some cool things like 'razor rain', but the show keeps venturing into 'soap opera' territory.They also used the phrase ""for the record..."", and they have people calling silly things ""amazing"" for which I always subtract at least one star.  I initially loved the sci fi series Bitten, but after they used the word ""amazing"" about ten times in five minutes, I had to quit watching.One final point:  You should look up Defiance on wikipedia for the backstory.  The series does not explain the history after the Votan (all 7 alien races) arrival, the subsequent war, the accidental release of terraforming technology, or destruction of the Votan fleet and the ensuing debris field that makes air travel or radio communication impossible.I was inspired to write this review after reading the most highly voted on 5 star review which gave an erudite explanation of how Defiance fits into the 'frontier spirit' of American film and literature.  I agreed with most of the review as to what the series was intended as.

"Mary Shannon (Mary McCormack) is a Federal Marshal with the Witness Protection Program.  Working along side her partner Marshall Mann (Fred Weller), she helps witnesses adjust to their new life in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Since most of these people are criminals who agreed to testify against other criminals, that isn't always easy.  For example, there's the con artist who may or may not have set her sights on a new mark, yet gets her picture in the paper.  There's the man who brings his wife and mistress into the program only to decide it was time to break up with his mistress.  And even when the witnesses are innocent, their lack of desire to leave their old life behind them can lead to problems, too.If all that weren't enough, Mary's personal life is far from calm.  She is supporting her dead beat mother (Lesley Ann Warren) and her sister Brandi (Nichole Hiltz).  Not only has Brandi fallen for Mary's sometimes boyfriend Raphael (Cristian de la Fuente), but she is also hiding methamphetamine until her boyfriend can arrange the sale.  What will happen when that little bombshell comes out?Personally, I'm still not quite sure what to make of this show.  At times, I am quite interested in seeing how things turn out.  Then I get fed up with the soap opera nature of Mary's personal life.  More often then not, Mary comes across as smug and condescending instead of human and funny, which I have a feeling is what they are aiming for.  And the way she lets herself get manipulated by her family drives me crazy.  And yet I keep watching because I need to know what will happen next.  And I will tune in when the second season starts.I certainly can't fault the acting in any of this.  The actors all do an impeccable job of bringing their characters to life, flaws and all.

"Let me say this first, I thought the main actress was super hot! Just wow!!!Now, onto my review. I thought this movie was pretty good for a indie film. It was made better than most indie films and some theater release ones too. The monsters were easy to do because they are just vampires and not much needed to do, but good make up and fangs. There were a few special effects needed and they were done well. The acting was okay, some actors were better than others. The directions was okay and I only spotted one error. The story was actually pretty well done,and that's what the movie really was best at.This movie isn't really scary, and just supposed to be funny. Personally, I just enjoyed it as a better indie film. I'll recommend this movie.","Not supposed to be scary, but has a good humor.",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",3,0

"This is an ok show, a bit too much Sopranos lite biker edition without the strong lead(s). Just because a guy looks menacing doesn't mean he doesn't have to be that way.I thought the female lead was pretty good, probably the most believable part of this show.I like the way it depicts how mc's are in fact OC, just more adapted to the modern world than the cosa nostra is. So RICOH makes sense, I'm not sure if that's been tried against them in the real world. They have the obvious advantage of fixing building motorcycles. It does a good job depicting how a lot of people leave their hometowns to get away from things, etc.I don't get the whole theme of Jacks' fathers manuscript, there are no specifics and it is never realized how it makes a difference in the plot. I'm watching season 2 and it still seems to have no relevance. The way they set it up it seemed like every episode was going to be an object lesson in Jacks' rebellion, never happened.Season 2 is just more of the same, I usually like shows more as they go along or they get better, it's the opposite with this show. I don't think I'll make it past season 2, like LOST, unless it gets better. It's way too unrealistic depicting hardened criminals. These are not family men or honor bound people they are criminals. This whole family of outlaws is so naive and silly. Boyscouts these are not. THERE""S NO CODE FOR CRIMINALS PERIOD Please stop the musical montages, they are so shrill and overdone.

"The concept of a cult film is still comparatively recent even though you can delve back into film history and realize they've been with us a long time. We simply didn't have the label. Then when ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" came out as a ""cult"" film it ticked me off. You don't set out to make a cult film. You set out to make a film that may, through audience reaction, become a cult film. Seems to me the makers of this flick were trying to make a cult film.Here's the scoop. Something comes down from outer space and splashes into the waters off a sleepy Irish Island. A creature emerges and begins feeding off the local populace. Said creature needs two things: Blood and water. However, the blood can't have any alcohol in it. The locals figure this out and proceed to get hammered while the head cop, and his fetching, temporary deputy try to determine how to dispatch this nasty intruder.This is a rather fun romp. The set up is similar to ""The Blob"" and ""Slither."" The characters are more 'type' than they are round, and, the entire town needing to get sloshed to avoid becoming monster chow, takes too much of the horror out of it. In ""The Blob"" and ""Slither"", as light as parts of those films might play, when the doo doo hits the fan, they become genuinely scary. This flick also pays homage to borrows from steals from ""Alien"" and ""Aliens."" This might not have bothered me so much had the film itself been better. The monster effects are pretty decent. The script also telegraphed certain things you knew had to come into play later on. I like being surprised so this took a little away from the enjoyment for me. Now, the directing. There were 8 or 10 film companies involved in the production. Seems to me they could have come up with a better director and camera man. This looks to have been shot on video and lacks the palette using film would have given it. The framing was just okay. Nothing jumped out as being particularly nifty or innovative. There were some nice shots of the Island itself though. Looks like a place one might wish to visit.",Didn't Grab Me,1384732800,"11 18, 2013",3,0
"The two remaining innkeepers at the Yankee Pedlar Inn get more than they bargained for when they set out to capture evidence of the hotel's legendary ghost in THE INNKEEPERS, Ti West's highly anticipated followup to HOUSE OF THE DEVIL. Once again, the director moves to impress with his incredible talent for balancing a slow, deliberate pace with clever characters and spooky suspense, though the same can't be said for the plot, itself. Sara Paxton and Pat Healy couldn't have been more perfectly cast as the two awkward leads, bringing their own dry wit and innocent charm to the characters. For all West's skills as a writer and director, however, he is found lacking as an effective storyteller. He simply doesn't know where to go with his films, and as a result, they typically fall apart in the final act. THE INNKEEPERS is no exception. While we have fun sitting back and laughing with his two bumbling hotel clerks, the questions set up in the first several chapters are left entirely open ended, and the mild shocks do not compensate for the lengthy build and anticipation. Still, it is impossible to deny the man's skill behind a camera. Even the most trivial scenes are made interesting through his keen visual style, which keeps the audience glued to the screen despite the overall lack of action. Fans of the slow burn will appreciate the many redeeming qualities in THE INNKEEPERS, and it is sure to receive a cult status amongst other subtle haunts like THE CHANGELING, THE SENTINEL, or BURNT OFFERINGS.

"One thing that I've noticed in looking at television reviews is that many people feel that if they watch a show, it automatically qualifies for a five star rave. I'm somewhat more pragmatic. I watch a variety of TV, not all of it is spectacularly good. In fact, I'd rate the shows I view regularly anywhere from 3 stars to 5 stars (I've even watched a few 2 or 1 star seasons when a program I liked dipped in quality). I'm mentioning this in preface to my comments about ""Primeval: New World"" because it's a show that I genuinely enjoyed as a lark. If you like dinosaurs, it's a bit of fun to pjazz the time. If you had the opportunity to watch it for free on SyFy (where it aired), I'd say ""go for it."" I'm a little more reticent about a full fledged DVD Blu ray purchase, however, because I'm not sure if you'd sit down to watch the series more than once. On the plus side: It's fun, lightweight, has an attractive cast, and some good dinosaur effects. Realistically, though, the monster of the week theme gets a bit repetitive. As the show tries to expand its mythology and intrigue later in the season, it does show signs of ramping up the drama to the next level. But just as things start to look more promising, the season comes to a close. And as the program was canceled, we'll never have the chance to see if the story lines would have deepened and gotten more rewarding.""Primeval: New World"" was a Canadian twist on the popular British series that ran for five seasons between 2008 and 2011. The original ""Primeval,"" which also struggled to find its initial footing, had a number of things going for it. In tone, it could be both exceedingly dark AND ridiculously goofy. The cast had a quirky energy and grooved together well, each playing a rather distinctive role. As the episodes progressed, the relationships and plot strands got progressively more twisted and complex and this kept things interesting. Not to be too harsh, but ""Primeval: New World"" is a decidedly blander affair in comparison. In this update, the dinosaurs are the stars and they are impressively rendered from episode to episode. Dinosaurs: FIVE STARS! The human storylines, however, are somewhat less interesting. Aside from the lead character (Eureka's Niall Matter), you don't get to know anyone with much depth. Sure, everyone is likable enough. And when things are kept at a breezy pace, this might be enough. But I really think that the show had the potential to be more impactful with its characterizations and plotting. The typical plot week after week is that when a dinosaur appeared, the crew faced it down and returned it home. This might be entertaining, but it certainly lacked imagination.Andrew Lee Potts (star of the original), as Connor Temple, makes a cameo at both the beginning and end of the series and it's great to see him. Matter plays a wealthy businessman scientific researcher who has his life upended when his wife is killed by a dinosaur. Obsessed and driven, he has dedicated most of his time to tracking down where this beast came from and discovers a series of anomalies that create time portals to past eras. In each episode, as I mentioned, a new creature squares off against the Canadian backdrop to create havoc and worse. Matter's team is comprised of Sarah Canning, Danny Rahim, and Crystal Lowe. He also has a potential love interest in Miranda Frigon, and their on going relationship is one of the more successful elements of the series. Also invaluable is Geoff Gustafson, an offbeat government official who may be an ally or he may be a foe. Of all the characters, it is Gustafson who remains the most mysterious, intriguing, and gets the best lines. Late in the season, a surprise appearance by Matter's Eureka co star Colin Ferguson is also a big treat!Toward the end of the series, the dinosaur hunters are facing a more dire government conspiracy as well. I really liked this angle, but it still lacks some depth. In the end, ""Primeval: New World"" is not particularly ambitious on its own. If you like dinosaurs, this may be just the ticket. But if you're a fan of the original, I suspect you'll notice the more generic tone of this piece. I enjoyed watching these episodes, but it's not a series that I would revisit and or remember as a new TV cljazzic. Pleasant enough, though, at 3 1 2 stars. KGHarris, 8 13.",The Dinosaurs Are Coming!

"Six episodes in, the last ten minutes of Episode 4 ""The Stewmaker"" is worth keeping   these minutes are PERFECT in evoking the loneliness of having a really bad day   the kind the bad guys give you in Auschwitz, in Unit 731, in Manila when you dare to defy the Japanese invasion, the music is perfect, the setting, the performances even of Elizabeth Keen paralyzed = PERFECT.I can't believe the hype about the success of this show.  It kind of drags when James Spader isn't on screen and even when he is on screen, I find myself thinking that this seems to be about his paritcular style of line delivery where some of the stuff coming out of his mouth is  such nonsense like how so and so was diving the barrier reef off Belize   it sounds like Mad Libs where you just insert exotic notions here and there to create an impression like James Spader's dead eyes and drawl.  I enjoy James Spader even more now that he is weightier despite his character's penchant for hats here   it is SO close to being Truman Capote ridiculous   pulled back from tipping over the edge by James Spader's constantly pressed lips throughout the series.  Megan Boone is nice and has very cute baby feet so there is all this cuteness hidden under boring work clothes but really this show is a demonstration that James Spader can command attention in more than one way.That doesn't make the show watchable to me but the Stewmaker episode ... Red Dragon is very creepy here and the last ten minutes   I wish I could buy just that scene.The way the show is written so that James Spader is the most interesting is very similar to the kdramaThe Greatest Love   Korean Drama (4 DVD) All Region with English Subtitleswhere the show is kind of flat whenever Cha Seung Won is not onscreen and that has everything to do with the writing and not the rest of the cast as indicated by the subsequent kdrama with the same lead actress and a very similar underlying message, Master's Sun.The show gets much better with the last two episodesAnslo Garrick (No. 16), Part 1and then you really have to wonder if James Spader's character wants everyone on his hitlist taken out for him facilitated by his orchestrating their appearance as well as getting into the government's files AND inexplicably seduce Elizabeth Keen into being on his side which Elizabeth Keen probably smells if she was raised by that hardnosed cast as her foster father.However, the big thing is that the premise of his reentry into the CIA building MAKES NO SENSE and picking Elizabeth Keene   newly hatched makes less than NO SENSE   but she's being surveilled at home as a result   even in the BATHROOM   by a bunch of old dudes across the street so the whole show may be about making her bait.",The last ten minutes of The Stewmaker - DELICIOUS but a rare treat on this series.,1383436800,"11 3, 2013",3,0

"MANIAC is the story of a crazy man. A maniac, if you will. Mentally ruined by a mother with, let's say, loose morals, Frank, our lead, spends most of his time restoring antique mannequins and the rest of his time struggling with lethal, sexual desires for women (and their hair). When Frank meets a young photographic artist named Anna, he tries to rise above his dark and disturbing fetish, but things don't look good.The film, ostensibly, stars Elijah Wood, although he's on screen for barely a tenth of the film. The bulk of the movie is told from Frank's POV as he struggles with headaches, sex, and his love of scalps. Although the story isn't terribly detailed, its refusal to spell everything out makes for an enticing psychological portrayal. Unfortunately, the POV filming ends up having the opposite of what I jazzume was its intended effect. Rather than drawing the viewer inside of Frank, enmeshing the audience in his thoughts and deeds, the POV perspective ends up distancing us from Frank. They say the eyes are the window to the soul, and we spend 95% of the film staring out those windows from the other direction. As a result, we don't see Frank's soul as much as we see the destruction the soul creates. This makes the film feel cold and half done.Saved from being a total loss by a strong score and some pretty convincing special effects, the movie has its moments (especially its final, brutal scene), but these feel more like teasing glimpses at what the film could've been had it allowed the viewer a better view of our title character.","Inside, Looking Out",1385251200,"11 24, 2013",3,0

"This is a prequel to the Burn Notice series. It is designed to tell the story of how Bruce Campbell's character Sam Axe ended up in Miami. It is essentially an hour and a half long episode, which aside from a 5 min cameo from Jeffrey Donovan, involves his character exclusively. It definitely misses things like the character interaction, quick wit and even the voice overs you get in the series. It just makes it feel a little off.The story centers around Sam having to train a ragtag band of farmers in Columbia who are mistakenly branded a terrorist organization to survive an attack by a corrupt paramilitary organization who want their land. There are also the requisite North American aid workers who get involved in the story, and toward the end a couple bumbling CIA officers who show up in Season 7 of the TV show. The story kind of skirts the line between serious and campy, and does have some tie ins to the show (like the origin of Sam's alias Chuck Finley).While Campbell did a fine acting job and plays his character well, I just think it lacked what makes the TV show so great. I know there are some people who really dislike this, and if you were expecting it to be more like the TV show as opposed to a stand alone movie, I can understand that sentiment. It is certainly not something that you have to see in order to understand anything in the series. Aside from knowing who the CIA agents are when they show up in the 7th season of the TV show, there is nothing else from this that has been tied in.As far as extras, there is audio commentary, some deleted scenes and a feature on Jeffrey Donovan directing.

The film's absurd premise   perhaps more absurd than that of ""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!""   interests us for the first 30 minutes or so, but the film soon runs out of trick, having nothing to add to the original concept of a stalking tire.""Rubber"" is about a killer tire roaming and murdering people in a California desert. You should not ask why it has to be a tire, because, as Lieutenant Chad (Stephen Spinella) warns you, these things happen for no reason. The tire destroys everything that happens to be in its path. Again, you shouldn't ask why. It just does.""Rubber"" is very self conscious. In the film ""audiences"" or ""spectators"" (including Wings Hauser) are seen watching what is going on through their binoculars. One character breaks the fourth wall, talking directly to the camera. Wings Hauser's character (or ""spectator"") points out the film's weakness to us. Interestingly, what he says about the film he is in is exactly what I was thinking. But then I thought: Do we need all these things?The most interesting aspect of ""Rubber"" is the special effects used to make the killer tire look alive. Its movement is natural and creepy.Unfortunately, what the tire does in the film is repetitious and pretty boring. According to Lieutenant Chad, this film is `homage to the ""no reason.""' That is fine. There is no reason for a tire to kill people. But there is a reason for an 82 minute film to feel drawn out.",A Killer Tire,1335225600,"04 24, 2012",3,0

"No hard sell on going vegan. I was open to going vegan but the film affirmed my view that vegans are so disgusted with factory farming that  they opt out all together. The film on cruely and animal abuse in factory farming, which they showed to their three New Yorkers  , willing to give it a try,  seemed to have the biggest effect.They were traumatised . As most americans would be if they chose not to turn a blind eye or were exposed to the sickening cruelty as suppressed by corporate interests.However it encouraged me to investigate if cage free eggs were more humane or Perdue chickens and their not. So the film 's a reminder to those of us trying to do the right thing and be more vigilant in sourcing animal food  products farmed humanely.I think a film on changing diet to be more vetarian with a little less meat and where to find it and being sure to verify pervasive fraudulant claims ( that are somehow still legal) is more useful.  Whatever  this over comsumption of meat and dairy within the last century  is not sustainable enviromentally or in health costs; we need more films to make the transition than turn vegan. I did not feel it was very representative that 2 out of 3 of the film's guinia pigs were  persuaded to turn vegan in the end.",upbeat non-preachy education,1364256000,"03 26, 2013",3,0

"V H S 2 (Simon Barrett et al., 2013)I went into V H S 2 with no small amount of trepidation, given how much the first had been talked up and how mediocre it ended up being. This was reinforced when I saw that some of the usual suspects were back, but Adam Wingard turned in his best film in six years with You're Next, and one of the new guys who signed on is the inimitable Jason Eisener, who helmed the mighty Treevenge before gaining fame and fortune with Hobo with a Shotgun, so I figured maybe it would be better this time around. And it is; lessons were learned from the first flick, and as a result, the editors had much freer reign in the cutting room; the film weighs in at a trim ninety five minutes.This time, the frame was directed by Simon Barrett, who you saw in front of the screen in the first movie (and who wrote both the frame and &#8220;Phase I Clinical Trials&#8221;), and it starts out leagues better than the frame in the first movie. A PI, Larry (Gayby's Lawrence Michael Levine), and his partner girlfriend something or other Ayesha (TV character actress Kelsy Abbott) are hired by the mother of Kyle (You're Next's L. C. Holt), a college student to find him after he's been missing a week. They break into his house and find much the same setup as we saw in the first movie, and while Larry looks around the apartment, Ayesha starts digging through his computer and, after finding a vlog where he makes reference to the tape sitting right next to her, she pops it into the player.&#8220;Phase I Clinical Trials&#8221;, directed by Wingard, is the first of the shorts, and in many ways it's the best of the lot. Herman (Wingard) lost an eye in an auto accident and has been fitted with a prosthetic (with recording capability, natch). All is relatively well until that night, when he sees a couple of apparitions. All is not right in Herman's head, it would seem. (Don't worry, that's only the first cheesy TV show reference in this review.) The next day, Clarissa (Awakened's Hannah Hughes), a woman who was at the doctor's office with Herman, shows up on his doorstep. He blows her off until she tells him he's not the only one having weird paranormal experiences. I haven't read any reviews or commentary yet, but I'm guessing a lot of people are complaining about the ending. Don't listen to them.Next comes &#8220;A Ride in the Park&#8221;, from Eduardo S&aacute;nchez (Lovely Molly) and Gregg Hale (Say Yes Quickly). A zombie apocalypse, from the zombie's point of view. Not awful...until you get to the ending. Then it is.&#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; comes next, and I'm still trying to decide what I think about it. While I was watching the movie, it blew me away. While there's obviously a supernatural element to it all, this story about a crazy Indonesian cult, brought to us by Timo Tjahjanto (Macabre) and Gareth Huw Evans (The Raid: Redemption), most has the ring of the possible about it, at least until the final third. Even then, the shenanigans the piece gets up to are creepily effective, and when the punchline hits&#8212;or splatters&#8212;it's still pretty amazing. Then they tacked on the final three minutes and the whole thing becomes a shaggy dog joke. I grant you, it's a funny shaggy dog joke, but still, it doesn't really fit with the rest of the piece. Despite that, it's very artfully done until then, and I'll be looking for more from these guys.The last of the batch is Eisener's contribution, &#8220;Slumber Party Alien Abduction&#8221;, and I wish I could say I liked it better than I did. Eisener's strength has always been his ability to combine humor and gore in a way more effective than most directors this side of early Sam Raimi. Here, however, he ditches the humor and plays it straight. Bad idea. A large part of me wants to compare it to M. Night Shyamalan's Signs, but it doesn't suck that bad.And throughout, I've been forgetting to talk about the gradual, but in hindsight kind of inevitable, decline of the frame story, which is thrown into pretty stark contrast when you compare its ending to that of Wingard's piece, which goes for the same style (without being spoily, we'll call it &#8220;ambiguous, but in such a way that you know exactly what happens after the camera dies&#8221;) and pulls it off much more successfully than Barrett does here.All in all, I liked it well enough. It's still not the second coming of the horror anthology we were promised with the first movie; the Southeast Asian film market is still kicking our jazzes when it comes to anthology films (viz. Zoo or Rampo Noir for excellent Asian examples of the genre). But if the guys behind this series keep up the same increase in quality when the inevitable V H S 3 comes around, they may be within spitting distance of the first really good American horror anthology flick since 1983's Nightmares. ** ",More fun than programming a clock!,1387238400,"12 17, 2013",3,0

"Taking a popular fictional series and adapting it to fit a one hour television format has to be a daunting task.  Sure, it's been done with some success such as Robert B. Parker's Spenser and Jesse Stone or Tony Hillerman's  Chee & Leaphorn novels (though except Spenser the other's were 2 hour movies).With A&E;'s ""Longmire"" they have taken Craig Johnson's present day sheriff of Absaroka County, Wyoming and brought him to the small screen.  If you never read Johnson's excellent stories you probably wouldn't find much to complain about.  But, as other reviewers have noted if you have read them you are in for a disappointing and befuddling experience.Casting is key; Robert Taylor looks the part of Walt Longmire.  For the most part the actor does a credible job portraying the character that is written fairly true to the books.  Mr. Taylor doesn't seem comfortable wearing a firearm though; he's always resting his hand on the butt of his pistol, kind of a rookie move for an ex Marine and long time peace officer.  Not sure looking like you're about to ""pull"" on everyone you talk to is a good strategy.  Katee Sackhoff has been critiqued by others in her role as under sheriff ""Vic"" Moretti but mostly for being blonde instead of brunette.  Hair color aside my problem with her is she's just not obnoxious enough as she should be, more of a ""Vic Lite"".  The biggest problem with the cast is the critical person of ""The Cheyenne Nation"" (as Walt calls him in the novels), Henry Standing Bear.  In the books Henry is a large man and an imposing physical presence and Lou Diamond Phillips, while a fine actor, lacks the sheer physicality to pull this off.For the readers familiar with the Longmire tales one of the more disorienting features of Season 1 is they start off each episode with almost exact recreation of the crime from one of Craig Johnson's books.  Naturally you think, ""oh, I know where this is heading"" but actually you don't as the screen writers then abandon Johnson's work and concoct a totally different set of circumstances.  It would be OK if the alternative solution was as good as the original but it never is.Other problems pertain to marginalizing important characters like Ruby, Walt's office manager or overemphasizing others like daughter Cady who's supposed to be living in Philly and not working in town and dating Walt's deputy who's challenging him for sheriff in the next election.

"The first two seasons of Ancient Aliens, along with The Pyramid Code, were an epiphany to me, and my paradigm for ancient history has been completely rocked.The third season, despite my highest hopes, is at best a rehash of ideas from the first two.  At worst, and for the most part, they push the package so far past believability, that it's almost as if they were set up by Zahi Hawjazz and the rest of the established liars to make themselves look as if they need to be wearing foil hats.This season is as disappointing as the previous two were ground breaking.  I don't know how much more information is currently available because Egypt and other governments seem to be hampering further digging and questioning of established theories.I have always taken a dim view of Biblical stories and other basically silly and unfounded ideas preached by religion about the origins of humans.  However, there are gaps and inconsistencies in the more mundane views of human evolution.  When we see parallel civilizations compared, which may have been highly evolved 20,000 years ago, or more...When we think of how the human brain has tripled in size in a few thousand years and when we see no concrete link between Neanderthaloids and modern humans, to the extent that we would be our current species, the questions only begin.The answers just aren't there in history, archeology, paleontology and absolutely, biblically as to why we are the species we are and moreover, why civilizations evolved so dramatically with technologies we can't approach today in such a short time, and why they devolved almost as rapidly in dark ages, which then redeveloped in entirely different directions.I have seen three different UFOs and photographed one I didn't see until I processed the photos.  I know what I saw, and I know these were not the crafts or technologies of humans, although a great black triangle I witnessed flying over the Front Range near Denver in November of 2002, was no doubt the same craft that had become known as the Phoenix Lights, and has been spotted and photographed many times over the years, could be a terrestrial ""Black Op"" of some sort.  It's sheer size mkes me doubt that hypothesis.I have photographed petroglyphs in Sego Canyon and other areas of Utah and the Southwest which represent characters that although resembling humans, resemble figures in protective suits far more, not to mention glyphs showing floating animals people and hovering craft.There are so many inconsistencies in what we are told, and what we can also see with our own eyes denies those lies.There has to be more, and more cogent arguments than are presented in the third season of Ancient Aliens.  If there is a fourth season, I hope they return to building on what was presented in the first two.This season has some merit, and food for thought, but it is not presented with the revolutionary force and logic of the first two.",Not up to the First Two Seasons,1327190400,"01 22, 2012",3,0

"Here is another Terrence Malick film, following ""The Tree of Life"" only made one year before. Reportedly, ""To the Wonder"" is, like his previous effort, a semi autobiographical movie of the director fiercely protective of his private life. Here Ben Affleck plays Neil, an American travelling in Europe, who falls in love with a recently divorced Ukrainian mother of one daughter Marina played by Olga Kurylenko. Meanwhile, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem), respected priest losing his faith.Though ""To the Wonder"" benefits from the poetic beauty of the images thanks to photographer Emmanuel Lubezki (who worked for the director's ""The New World"" and ""The Tree of Life""), the film itself remains an impressionistic collection of images. We are supposed to look behind these images and find something, while honestly I am not sure it's worth trying.I know Terrence Malick's unique filmmaking style, and I love his earlier work ""Days of Heaven,"" which offers a simple but intriguing story. In this newest film, what the director does with fragmentary images may be unconventional, but what happens in the film, if derived of its showy styles, is pretty conventional, even banal, together with the dull voiceovers. To me, ""To the Wonder"" is frustratingly pretentious and self indulgent.I think I know ""To the Wonder"" is trying to do. It's about the feeling and emotion envisioned by the director. But people just don't cry or laugh. There is a context in which those emotions are expressed, and usually dialogue, story or character development provides that context, which the film refuses to do.

No, I realize this is a TV Show and sometimes being able to see characters' facial expressions or adding some foreshadowing can help that along. So maybe I'm annoyed by a few hundred years of Viking technology and events all getting compressed into one loose cannon who doesn't play by the rules? Nah, compression can help move a story along and give us a hero for the story.It annoyance is the overall narrative where the Vikings are shown as an ignorant, dirty, savage people seemingly isolated from the rest of Europe. This completely unnecessary portrayal forces the Vikings into a weird &#34;New Land&#34; narrative whereby the Vikings don't believe there is any land to the West, and Ragnor bravely sails it find a peaceful native people and proceed to pillage them. The Vikings are made to be completely mystified by the written word (staring at it dumbly before burning it), unnecessarily killing every single monk, and completely unaware of Christianity. Never mind that the Vikings had been trading with people in the current U.K. for decades before. Never mind that the Vikings had their own written language. Never mind that it is unlikely the raid was random, but at least the result of gathered information, if not some kind of retribution. And while the real raid was very brutal, not every monk was killed or taken captive, many were left alive and the monastery continued to function.There is some attempt to soften this brutal portrayal by showing a Viking court proceeding with laws and something of a trial. Women are also shown to have some power in society with Ragnor's wife coming across as fiercely independent (ironically, a woman fighter would be very odd for real Vikings). However, this effort is quickly erased by other women getting raped or threatened with rape as everyday occurrence. (The Vikings are believed to have had anti rape laws and strong taboos against harming women, although the treatment of foreign women and slaves is probably up to interpretation), and the town chief has two men brutally killed without a trial for minor acts of treason. One of whom appears to be the only blacksmith, and the other a loyal spy.Whenever the writers can make the Vikings out be their stereotypical crjazz, ignorant, dirty, violent men, that path is chosen.

"The movie consists of four ""found footage"" stories that are shown in a ""Creep Show"" fashion. The stories are not connected, other than the fact they are being watched by the same people, a pair of private investigators. The films include ghosts, aliens, cultist, and my favorite a ""zombie cam."" This is the first time I can think of where we get a zombie eye view of attacking humans.The stories were fair and sometimes crude. There were also times when the footage deviated from the true found footage CAM as we witness the person with the camera. The DVD has two versions which I found confusing. One is the ""rated version"" and the other was the ""unrated theatrical version."" For some reason I believe versions released to the theater are rated...by law while those not released do nor require a rating.The production is fun low brow horror entertainment. I did find the ""eye cam"" to reach a new low in irritating jerky motion.

"First of all, I love the concept.  Wish we would see more of Dorothy.  Love the plot lines.  Adventurous Dot is great!  But, THE VOICE for Glenda just doesn't work.  Too goofy.  Daughter didn't like it either. Keep that voice for the crazy magic hat, if you must, but recast Glenda ... if you want the show to last more than a few weeks.Personally, I wouldn't tune in again just because I wouldn't want to watch more of airhead Glenda.  Glenda shouldn't be a stand in for Goofy.  And I am one that liked the concept...so if I wouldn't bother again... and my daughter found it dull, I think you have a problem with Glenda.Just my thoughts now: Dorothy is a MAJOR character, so if you have her in the show, use her.  I know this detracts from DOT and so it is problematic.  Still, you can't have DOT as the only sensible character and hope that it will attract many viewers. Even Little Boo, comes off as totally below Dot and just a foil for her smarts.  Maybe part of the charm of Oz was that there were several characters to cheer for.  I think in its current state, you just show one, Dot.  And I like Dot.

"I refuse to pay for the outrageous cable and satellite network package deal prices because you are paying for shows you don't watch or are included with your packages. Thats why I love the options that are available on Amazon, Netflix, Hulu and other streaming providers. These services allow me to watch shows that I otherwise would not be able to view. Ok, enough about my rants on cable and sat. providers and on with the show.I have watched every episode of SOA at least twice now and have a decent knowledge of the show and it's characters and the storyline. I'll start with what drew me to the show and why I have stayed the course. In the first two seasons the show rocked with its edgy writing, twists and turns, character development, stories and the bikes, guns and girls. It can and does get pretty violent ( a little more than I like, but hey this is about an outlaw biker gang. oops I mean club.)The writers and directors have no problems with killing off popular characters ( a nice change from many shows) even though I didn't like to see one of Jax's bros go. The show also includes some of the primary characters ""Old Ladies"" and their indirect direct involvement with the clubs activities and how they manipulate their men to get what they want too.The show for me started to loose some of it's luster in season three, but not nearly as bad as seasons four through six. The stories just started to get so outlandish and unbelievable that the've become kinda cartoonish. I will not go into any details for obvious reasons of spoiling any episodes. They are just as violent as ever and Jax and the crew are still as bad a@@ed. The senarios are what's hurting this once edgy show the most as is the over used Gemma  meddling. The shows title is ""SON'S OF ANARCHY"" not ""THE MEDDLING OLD LADIES OF ANARCHY"" and that's hard for me to say since I've liked Sagal since ""Married With Children"". I know , she's married to the producer writer director Kurt Sutter, but come on now!The show still has some of it's trademark twists and turns, but now they are expected and easier to see coming and figure out. In season six I thought they missed the maximum impact of the major senario that played out involving Clay, the Irish and the club by a long shot. Again, I won't give any details away for those who haven't watched the show or specific episodes.I still enjoy the show and will miss it when it ends next season, but it is just not quite as good as it was in it's first two seasons. People, please remember this is my opinion and I know that many will disagree with it, but respect it as much as I do yours!!!PS. NEWS FLASH FOR THE FINAL SEASON OF ""SON'S OF ANARCHY""  GEMMA TAKE'S TAKES OVE THE REINS AS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF SOA  We have all seen her getting stronger as each seasons pjazzes with her aggressive tactics and her mind controlling manipulations of those who challenge her.

"Vikings is a tamer Rome.  (given the station, it is understandable)We will start with the bad:The characters are sometimes hard to follow as they seem to want to try and break the stereotype mold.  The obvious villain stays obvious, but the obvious turncoat(s) turns out good, but then not so, then is so, then not so again.  It made it a little tough to cheer for a character or not.  You feel bad for them one minute, then they completely go against the grain for seemingly no reason.The relationships built between the initial raiding party are hinted at being tight but the show does not bother to explore them and instead uses the raiding party as fodder to fuel other storyline developments.  They work like expendable family members.The fight scenes are just not that good.  You can see the obvious scene stops in each fight sequence and the over all choreography is just too slow.  The actors seem like they are afraid to actually HIT.  You don't see the &#34;fighting like demons&#34; aspect that is talked about.All of that said...  The Good.The story, for me, was compelling though obvious.  Its an interesting look into the life of Vikings while following a potentially fictitious hero, Ragnar.  (People still debate whether he was real or an amalgam of other Norse heroes)  His son, unlike Carl in the walking dead, is not an insufferable pain to see on screen, and his wife actually adds something to the story.  The customs and legends are great and interesting to follow up on in your spare time.  The acting is pretty good, though Travis Fimmel's facial expressions tend to confuse the situation.  That said, I do like the way he is playing Ragnar.For a first season, it is not bad and I will be tuning in for a second season when it finally drops.  It is not good enough to rave over, or to rush home to see at it's regularly scheduled time slot, but it is good enough to watch start to finish via Prime.  Hopefully the second season will delve a little deeper into the opening sequence and provide a little more of the raiding that is talked about so heavily in the first season.","Good, but could be better",1389312000,"01 10, 2014",3,0
"Opens with a very intriguing premise: Identical twin brothers born 10 years apart. One, a troubled young man and the other, a serial killer. Can investigators locate and stop the killer by studying the younger brother? Is the younger brother trying to investigate his new found fraternal relationship or is he discovering the path to madness?Tim Hutton delivers another solid, if uninspired, performance. And Mguel Ang&eacute;l Silvestri does a decent job as Marco   the young man who may hold the key to the creation of and hunt for a serial murderer.There were a few things that made this stumble from very interesting into dullsville.First the plot. While presenting us with a fairly interesting concept, with heavy impressions taken from Follet's 'The Third Twin' notwithstanding, the film lacked the requisite cold darkness for movies of this genre; the sense of consistent impending dread.Secondly, the deaths were, and I mean no casual disrespect to the idea of murder, but they were quite benign in movie terms. Serial offenders are freaks and their acts unspeakable horrors. However, the killer in this film seems quite tame when compared to real life terrors like Gacy, Gein, or movie monsters like John Doe in 'Seven'. The lack of creativity subtracted from the drama considerably.Thirdly, the film has the pacing and cinematic quality of a tv movie, quickly becoming fairly predictable and stale. Scenes in these types of productions should be done from a limited color palette   varying sepias and high contrast shots tend, in my opinion, to present the best stage for the genre.And finally, the inappropriate selection of Tania Sarrias as Hutton's romantic interest. Lacking screen presence only makes her awful command of English that much more noticeable. Combined with that toothy mug and hoarse voice   it's no understatement to say she was uninviting as a co star. And most importantly, her character failed miserably to delve into the crux of the film: Could she, as a psychiatrist, uncover a killer from the genetic twin who did not grow up in the same environment his older brother?There are many beautiful and talented Spanish actresses that I can think of who could've easily done this role justice. So once again it becomes a game of 'Who Shagged Whom?'.

"The best way to describe the second half of season 3 is that for the first 7 episodes, Jenna's character becomes totally despicable; although they try to redeem her character in the final 3 episodes, the best way to sum it up is what Sadie says to Jenna in the final epode, something to the effect, ""It's not fun calling you a skank pot head ho anymore, because it's just the truth."" The sad thing, it really is all true, and I wonder if the viewers can accept a character so fundamentally altered? I understand Jenna will in fact be back for season 4, however, the creator of the show has abandoned the project, and the two new show runners writers are a couple of homosexual males who are getting rid of some characters  (such as Ming and the Asian Mafia) in favor of introducing two ""Beavis and Butthead"" type gay characters, and an African exchange student; so enjoy this last taste of the real ""Awkward."" because big changes are coming.",Jenna's Waterloo,1389398400,"01 11, 2014",3,0

"Wow, this show has some great potential. But... there are several issues that I think need to be addressed before it is ready for a series pickup.First, the pacing. It moves far too slowly for a show in this genre. Too much time spent on things that have nothing to do with moving the plot forward nor advancing any of the character arcs. That really needs to be tightened up &#8212; a much higher percentage of action forward momentum.Second, several of the characters seem stereotyped to me. The female cop is nearly a carbon copy of the police woman in the recent series Under The Dome (they even look the same). The hard fighting, hard drinking, hard womanizing Irishman is also sort of a bore &#8212; seen it way too many times.Third, I believe some recasting is in order. I'm just not feeling the actress who plays the French woman at all. She simply doesn't have much screen presence, and thus it's impossible for me to care about her character one iota. I'd also recast the role of the hooker, to someone with a little more acting chops.On the plus side, I did like Aldis Hodge a lot. And Adrian Pasdar is very much in his element as the sleazy lawyer (which again, is such a trope, but I'm hoping there's more to his character behind that stereotype).But I do hope this gets some thorough revisions fixes, because there was quite a bit that I was intrigued by, and I'd really like to see what Chris Carter does with the show &#8212; just not in its current state.","Has potential, if some changes are made",1391817600,"02 8, 2014",3,0
"I bought this dvd and 5 other seasons on the recommendation of my back doctor. So, far the first episode has been very dry and dull. The second episode picked up nicely. I am up to the fifth episode and still unsure about this show. At times, it's a series about a psychotic serial killer with morals. Other times, it's about a man who has no feelings but shows emotions like anger, frustration and fear. Oh, and there's the relationship between the main character and his damaged girlfriend. Who he feels is as damaged as he is. Now, I do hope these are not considered spoilers, as they are the central focus of the series it seems. There are more things going on in the series, such as his past relationship with his foster father, he relationship with his foster sister, his relationship with his coworkers etc. At this time, I can see the character developing into a very interesting but bizarre person. And of course the series will follow suit. We hope. After all, I have 6 seasons to watch. Can I recommend this series, sort of. I am not quite certain it is for everyone. It's growing on me though.

"I'm generally not a fan of the format but with Barry Levinson at the helm, this is about as good as it gets. A picturesque seaside town gets wiped out by some rapidly growing organism that's evolved from the crap being dumped in the bay. Short of Al Gore nodding his heading knowingly, this flick is a dire warning of how the life of small town America could get royally hosed by big agricultural corporations who don't care about dropping your little village into a zombie fest.Our story starts with one of the few survivors (a journalist, oh no) Skyping her confessions to the audience. There's a lot of Skype in this film by the way. We watch the stories of various town citizens unfold on what is fatally their final day just because the evil mayor put steriod filled chicken doodoo in the water. Damn him. There are legions, boils, blisters and eaten organs along the way and it's cleverly confined to one place to add an extra level of doom. It's very similar to the film Quarantine (or the original Rec) in the way the events are shown through the eyes of a reporter just to make sure we can explore every tragic story in great detail.Whereas I find most found footage movies distracting for the endless need to explain why there's a camera in the scene, The Bay is handled very well given the limitations of the format.

This is clearly a love or hate affair or like me try to see the good in it. This is a good movie by many standards but also a disappointment. The Cinematography is amazing like Drive. The characters were extremley cool looking and interesting but very underdeveloped. I loved Drive so much I really wanted to see similarities. But Nicolas clearly wanted to make that statement clear this is not a HERO. Basically Ryan was the same character but not as aggressive and extremley pathetic I hate to say. The soundtrack was good as usual but not as good as DRIVE. This soundtrack carried out more like a pulsating score.The gore aspect was interesting but seemed sort of unnessary unlike in DRIVE. This clearly could have been Drive Part II if the story was more developed. The trailer plays it out that way but this is not the case at all. This is not a revenge story it more of a story of weakness. This clearly doesn't focus around JULIAN(RYAN) but a crooked Cop that doesn't mind killing. It seems like the cop was the hero in this film and was the villian also :(. What a creative and missed opportunity for a really great film. This could have continued were the last left off. And he could have fled to Bangkok and the gangsters could have been trying to take him out there.Instead we get a movie the looks like DRIVE cosmetically . But could have actually been Drive but its muttled mess that looks like it was based off Drive but not. Nicolas Refn really needs to co write with someone this was a missed opportunity for him. He could have really proved him self after Drive. Hopefully he will try harder on the next film which seems interesting With Cary mulligan in it also from DRIVE and SHAME. With the expectations that was set for him after the last film . I am really surprised he would have tarnished Ryan Goslings heroic character. Such a cool character that could have went so many directions even in sequels. Not to meantion the whole mute thing really worked in Drive. My theory is tough guys don't talk they do. To have someone lose over and over again what is the point? To say he his avenging his brother but losing every battle ..what is the point? Point made I guess if he set out to show that good guys finish last then he made his point. Nothing this director has done in the past has been accessable Bronson was just ok .

When one of the friends suddenly commits suicide due to past memories coming back to haunt him, this begins a roller coaster ride of emotions and discussions on what to do with the body, and eventually each friend is affected by becoming progressively worse mentally.  They debate whether doing the right thing and calling the cops is what they should do, or.. should they bury the body in the back yard?  After all, they're heavily under the influence of drugs (of course they don't act like they are  storyline flaw there) and a cop would be able to detect this right away.  From here, well let's just say, the emotions really take their toll on each of the friends as tensions rise and accusations fly.Of course it never really made sense how a female cop just suddenly enters the picture without reason, and even worse is the final chase scene.  Without spoiling the final segment, let's just say, why wouldn't she have a gun after it becomes perfectly clear that the suspect she's after is obviously guilty?  Another illogical moment of writing.Either way, it's unforgivable to ignore the first hour of deplorable party time that does absolutely nothing but bore me to tears.  The only time I'm impressed is when cljazzic Sex Pistols and Funkadelic songs are playing.  REALLY good songs too, so at least the soundtrack is up to par which is more than I can say for the rest of the film.  But hey, if you're an incredibly patient person, maybe you'd be able to tolerate the first hour of nonsense just to experience the significantly better second part.  Since so much time is devoted to very little substance however, I have a hard time recommending this one.",at least the second half is drastically better than the first,1387324800,"12 18, 2013",3,0

The production values of Extant  and the acting are excellent, yet, it does not appear from this episode to be taking us where  no man or woman has not gone before. What I mean by that is, while it is entertaining, Extant is going to have to show greater originality rather than being a rehash of human problems no matter how media current those problems are.

"My review for the first season said a fun& lighthearted series...not so much now with the twists & storyline headed for something more strange than the teen girls being mermaids.  Also, it seems like there are different writers because there are more holes in the plots and episodes. For example, in one episode, one of the main characters knows about one girl being a mermaid and then the next episode, without any explanation, he knows all three girls are mermaids even though it was supposed to be kept from him.  Also, without spoiling it for you, I will just say that some major characters leave the show and it's just not the same, although I will say a few of the new people are talented and good. Still, it feels like some of the other characters are reaching, such as Cleo. As if she grew up a little too much and is trying too hard at acting.

"Consider this exchange between Titus Welliver (Detective Harry Bosch) and Scott Klace (Sergeant Mankiewicz) when ""Mank"" wants Bosch to investigate a report of the discovery of a bone:Mank: ""The guy says it's human, Harry.""Bosch: ""Yeah, well, it always is...until it isn't.""Mank: ""You're right. 99 times out of 100 what is it? A coyote, deer, cow, whatever?""This devil's advocacy might have worked, had Bosch been the one to elaborate, in his vain attempt to avoid the jazzignment. Spoken by the sergeant, this bit comes off as a clumsy attempt to give the viewer insight and explain the usual frustration in such cases. It would be more believable as true cop banter if it had been Bosch utilizing the argument to avoid the call.This poor allocation of good dialogue is just one example of many ways that the best jazzets of this show have been mis managed.Familiar faces seem mis cast, while it is easy to imagine them doing a brilliant job in a different role.

"This was a nice idea for a short film. Its a strange parody of a horror film complete with breaking the fourth wall. Its really about breaking the rules of story and film in general. A tire comes to life out in the desert, comes to town and kills a bunch of people. The acting is generally good. The ""bits"" as written are well done. But the whole thing is way, way padded out. The idea just doesn't have enough in it to carry the whole film alone. And the filler between the good bits gets real boring fast.They either needed to cut it down to 20 minutes or add something major to the story. The laughs just don't come fast enough and the good bits they do are quite obviously spread far apart. Some people will like it in its current length. Its arty and cute at 80 minutes. But those outside the European art house crowd are going to notice how the story drags really quick. And putting space between absurdist gags tends to undermine them.Quentin Dupieux displays considerable talent in doing short films. He previous did the French film ""steak"" which was similarly absurdist. But he needs to get beyond writing a series of bits and gags. He needs to learn how to pace out a full length film and how to put together a long form story. Or else he should stick to shorter films.Its not perfect. But its creative, well crafted with good writing and good acting. In spite of its flaws, its absolutely worth seeing.

"This is a conventional story about a former award winning writer of western novels.  Monte Wildhorn (Morgan Freeman) has given up writing and has become an alcoholic.

"Have seen a lot worse, and a lot better. This is one of those SciFi Saturday Specials that falls in between; not quite a pile of crap   but a far cry from the smelliest pile that's ever been produced.What I would have appreciated was primer, something a lot more clear than what's provided to us at the beginning of the film. So that's what I'm going to do for you here. If the premise sounds ridiculous   it is. So you need to make up your mind as to watching it based on the primer itself.Ready?Okay here it is: For some unknown reason an alien enemy has decided that it needs to destroy mankind. Now, normally that would be via war or invasion. But in this case the aliens have decided to use a manufacturing plant that pumps out humans converted into zombies.These zombies are very difficult to kill, very strong, and come equipped with their own arm pike blade pick axe. Their mission is to destroy humanity, and those that somehow survive their initial rabid jazzaults, are then pulled back to the manufacturing plant for conversion to new zombies.Got that so far?So when this first happened mankind was nearly destroyed. But with one last ditch all or nothing supreme effort   humanity fought back and won a stalemate by burying the manufacturing plant and sealing it off.We now jump ahead a few thousand years. The previous global destruction bought about vast changes in civilization and (importantly) most of what happened before the aliens attacked has been forgotten; mankind has rebuilt themselves to a version of the world circa 1915   a time when we are literally reliving World War I. Trench warfare, doughboys, kaiser inspired troops, gas attacks, etc, etc. A few notable differences are that the world is run by corporations not governments and they have steam powered flying ships.Got that?Okay, so during this continuous corporate battle for resources   battle troops accidentally release the seal holding back the zombie manufacturing plant and then all hell breaks loose   literally.Again on the verge of being wiped out   a small band of heroes sets off to end the threat once and for all, led ostensibly by a monk priest of the old order. The same ones who led the battle against the aliens the last time. They are the only remaining believers   the rest of world, especially the corporations, think they're quaint ridiculous religious nuts. But they held onto the records from the last battle and are the only ones who have the secret to ridding themselves of the zombie machine.That's your primer. Now it's on you to decide whether or not you want to watch the film.I will add this   the director seems to have borrowed much from the same team that brought about the Angelina Jolie film ""Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow"" in that much of the film is digitally created with real actors working against a green screen. But that's not a bad thing. The CGI driven scenes are surprisingly good and mostly believable.The storyline is an another thing altogether.

"My children have been fans of the Dr Who reboot since the very first Ecclestone episode ""Rose."" The first episode of the Matt Smith Doctor was a brilliant tour de force, far superior to Russell T Davis' transition from Ecclestone to Tennant. But... Moffat seems unable to perform the job RTD performed. Each episode feels rushed. The Doctor is invariably manic, the action races by, and... we don't really care. The emotional depth that was present with the two previous incarnations has been abandoned in favor of a more cartoon like approach that frankly doesn't live up to the standard we hope for with this iconic show. The latest episode Cold War was closer to the spoof alien movie Paul than to anything worthy of the Doctor's imprimature. At one point I almost expected the Ice Warrior to offer Clara a splif   it was really that bad. It's instructive to re watch the earlier series, especially Series One and Series Three, to see what this show is capable of becoming at its best. At its worst it's nearly a parody of itself, which is a very unwelcome echo of the old days, the end game of which was cancelation due to audience fatigue. It may be time for the BBC to recognize that while Moffat was capable of creating some very superior individual episodes under RTD's reign as show runner, he's apparently not capable of handling responsibility for maintaining quality across an entire series. And while it was brave to jazzign the role of Doctor to such a young actor, it may be time for Smith to pjazz the baton to someone with greater dramatic range.

"On its face, Best Man Down feels like a movie bogged down in indie movie cuteness, from its quirky premise to the over written character names (I can't tell you how much I wished Labine's character had been named anything but &#34;Lumpy&#34;) to the wall to wall indie rock score, which is always very pretty but a bit too on the nose, emotionally speaking. The good news is that the movie has more emotional depth than any of this would suggest.Long and Weixler are very good as the couple thrown into tragic and bizarre circumstances, and there are hints at some of the rough road they have ahead (much of it having to do with money, which continues to play a huge role in many of their conversations). Questions are raised about the difference between what is a &#34;best&#34; friend and just one's oldest friend, and whether or not those are the same thing. Weixler's character is obviously overmedicating her troubles away, not the least of which being the anxiety brought on by the constant needling of her mother (played by Shelley Long). There's good stuff in all of this, only Ted Koland doesn't seem to trust his moments. Anything implicit is made explicit by having characters flat out speak the subtext a lot of the time, and it's frustrating. There are the building blocks of a really good character piece about relationships inside Best Man Down, but then out of nowhere a character will be caught masturbating and we'll remember that Koland is too stuck making a movie to say something about real life. Not all the time, but enough.Timlin's performance as 15 year old Ramsey is so good that she manages to overcome the cliches surrounding her character&#8212;the white trash mom (Frances O'Connor, Book of Love) who talks to a psychic, the possibly abusive stepdad (Evan Jones, The Book of Eli) who is selling and taking drugs, the kids at school who are pointlessly cruel. All the supporting details of Ramsey's life seem informed by a Lifetime movie, which isn't to say that there aren't 15 year olds whose lives are very much like that, just that Koland hasn't considered any of the details make any of it feel lived in and real. The movie wants to set up a character who has never felt loved and takes the shortest possible route to get there. Koland deserves credit for the way the movie pays off the relationship between Ramsey (ugh) and Lumpy (ugh ugh), even if it does feel pat and gets everyone off the hook. Those moments are handled nicely, especially by Timlin and Labine. Their scenes together are so good that we're left wanting more of them.That's true of the movie as a whole. In a climate in which most movies need to lose about a half hour, Best Man Down is the rare film that could stand to be a bit longer. There are just too many story lines to service, to many relationships to explore. Koland spends 80 minutes establishing a lot of good stuff and then, apparently realizing it's time to wrap things up, just tosses it all away with a series of too neat conveniences. It doesn't undo everything that came before, but it's difficult not to think the film would resonate a lot more if Koland had stuck the landing.Magnolia's DVD of Best Man Down gets the job done, with an anamorphic widescreen transfer that's natural and pleasant, with stable colors and no disruptive digital tinkering. The 5.1 surround audio track keeps the dialogue clear in the center channel while reserving the the remaining speakers primarily for the moody indie rock that populates the soundtrack. There's a smattering of bonus features including an outtake reel, short interviews with director Koland and star Long, an EPK style featurette and the film's original theatrical trailer.Patrick Bromley, DVD VERDICTRead the full review at dvdverdict.com",Good enough that I wish it was better,1390953600,"01 29, 2014",3,0
"""Justified"" gave us two great seasons, partly because of the excellent work of the evil Bennett clan, especially Mags (Margo Martindale), Dickie (Jeremy Davis), and Coover (Brad William Henke). The two principal actors, Timothy Oliphant and Walton Goggins, are the mainstay of the series, but the Bennett clan was really the topping on the already rich cake.In case you didn't already know, the series is based on Elmore Leonard's work, and Leonard is well known for works which include ""Get Shorty"", ""Hombre"", and ""Jackie Brown"". His prior ventures in TV series include the short lived ""Karen Sisco"" (2003 4) and ""Maximum Bob"" (1998), so ""Justified"" is his first real TV hit. For his work as Executive Producer he received a Peabody in 2011.The series was nominated 5 times for an Emmy and Margo Martindale deservedly won in 2011 as Best Supporting Actress.Although the entire cast is excellent (Nick Searcy, Joelle Carter and Natalie Zea especially), one has to wonder whether ""Justified"" can succeed without the Bennetts. Personally I have my fingers crossed.FWIW   I just saw the opening for the 2013 series and I have to say I am disappointed. There is no real villain yet and the new characters are pretty dull, with the exception of ""Constable Bob"".

"The film is an English language Spanish production with American stars (Hutton and Garcia Lorido) and Spanish actors and crew. The supporting characters are well cast but needed bigger roles and better material. The talented Spanish actors seemed restricted by sparse flimsy dialogue and limited (inexperienced?) direction.The core of this psychological thriller is the hunt for a serial killer, stalking his female victims along the northwestern Mediterranean. The very beginning of the movie is disjointed and jumbled across a few countries but most of the story takes place in Spain, where it is discovered, by DNA tests, that the killer is one half of monozygotic twins, conceived by implantation 10 years apart. No spoilers.Timothy Hutton, one of the brightest stars of his generation and the youngest actor ever to receive an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (Ordinary People, 1980) in 1981, seemed to be unmotivated and sleepwalking in the shallow role of Tom Brindle, the Europol criminal profiler brought in to solve the case.(Hopefully, Hutton took this role to support the young director or simply for a payday, but not because of a career slump).Miguel &Aacute;ngel Silvestre, the 26 year old, Spanish ex tennis player, manages the part of Marco, the wrongly accused ""good twin"", with aplomb. He gives a credible sense of a conflicted, angry and defensive young man.Kate, Marco's love interest is portrayed by the luminous and talented young American actress, Dominik Garcia Lorido, voted one of 50 Most Beautiful People in 2005 by People Magazine. She is the daughter of Andy Garcia. Viewers may recognize her as Mercedes Lazaro in ""Magic City"". Her minor role, in this 2008 film, did not take full advantage of her artistic talents.The young director Bryan Goeres' experience was mostly as an jazzistant director and TV series producer when this movie was made. The writing of the script and story by Jay Beattie and Darby Parker appears to be greatly influenced by their work on TV (Criminal Minds, Knowing, etc.). The script is derivative with similarities to ""Law & Order"", ""Dexter"" and the French film ""Crimson Rivers"", the writing clumsy and the plot plodding in some sequences, while appears rushed in other scenes. The complicated plot twists and uneven rhythm of the story detracted from the psychological momentum or thrill factor. Set decorations are uneven and amateurish. Special effects are substandard.The ""twins"" angle and the contrived ending may have been the impetus to produce this movie, but sadly it fell flat. It is a far cry from the outstanding contributions of the greatly talented Spanish actors and directors that have been distinguished in the international film industry.Upon reflection (sic.)

The supporting actors are just as good; Jack Huston (Potty Periwine) and Janet McTeer (Mrs. Satterthwaite) steal a few scenes.I endured the entire five episodes hoping for an upturn but the series fizzles at the end. As much as I liked Cumberbatch and Hall as actors I could not care for their characters. I cannot recommend this series.Beautiful costumes, beautiful art and natural settings. .Cumberbatch did his best as Christopher and Sylvia was wonderfully acted. as his despicable wife. The story was slow moving and the content has lost some of its relevancy in the 21 Century. The staunch, stalwart aristocrat that was Christopher has seen his like generously in British novels and television programs and is quite familiar to American audiences.",Slow and not engaging,1405555200,"07 17, 2014",3,0

"Well, firstly I like a lot of the actors and actresses in this show.  Ted grates on my nerves at times, but that's the fault of the whiney part they have him playing, not the actor himself.And Barney.... I liked the actor in Dougie Howser, and the White Castle movie.. .and, well, his character started out as reprehensible and went down hill from there.I think that's a common thread with all these characters, over the years they have gone from pretty funny, to some sort of twisted characterization (sp?) of what they were initially.Couple that with the whole premise, which to me implied &#34;Just wait til you meet his wife, she will be (wait for it)  AWESOME&#34;.The actress that they got to portray Ted's wife did an excellent job in my opinion, BUT (Stop here if you haven't seen the series finale).Spoilers....It's like they decided &#34;yup, time to end the series, let's throw the audience a bone, give them the mother, then kill her off post haste so Ted can possibly get back together with Robin....&#34;, Who, has been with the majority of New York by the end of the series.  Sort of like going out and intentionally buying used tires that you know are retreaded for your car.I thought the end cheapened Barney, Robin and what I had hoped for as a redemption in his character at least.  And the whole &#34;Yeah, slept with 31 women in one month, oopsie, got the last one preggers....&#34;  (what did he do wear a hole through his condom?And TED, after all the crap he went through, they couldn't bear to give him a happily ever after &#34;Well, he met the love of his life, that last for a couple of years, back out there now...&#34;Yeah, that sort of thing happens in real life (lost my wife a few years ago), but this was pegged as a romantic comedy.3 Stars just because previous years have been entertaining.I actually stopped watching this around season 6   7 when it looked like Robin was starting to bounce through the second round of the same guys and none of the other plot points interested me.Went back for Season 8, fast tracked through most of it, just to get a consistent feel for the finale.Never will get that time back.First few seasons, I thought entertaining, downhill slide from there, still one of the better things that was on TV at the time.",I followed this thing for 8 seasons for what again?,1397779200,"04 18, 2014",3,0

Bebe Neuwirth is the only known actor in this production.  Four interns from different backgrounds come to work at the same company owned (?)by Neuwirth.  She is a harsh manager who enjoys punishing her employees with the fear of being fired held over them.  The gimmick employed for this show is that the principles break into song (as in a Broadway Musical) to express their feelings.  The pilot failed to grab my attention but did hint at the possibilities by not trying to imitate either the flash of Glee or the spectacle of Smash (both of which I think are far too overwhelming).,Freshly different,1366934400,"04 26, 2013",3,0
"As anyone can tell you, comedies are a tough sell, especially when broaching such subject matter as the end of mankind.  Some wouldn't dare find anything close to that a laughing matter, but when it's used merely as a backdrop for broader, more general comedy, it certainly can be a nice filter.  That's exactly what writer director Todd Berger set out to do with IT'S A DISASTER: he combined an end of the world scenario and mashed it up with a twentysomething and thirtysomethings coming of age comedy (THE BIG CHILL meets PERFECT SENSE.  On many counts, it just doesn't quite work; yet, there's something wonderfully sublime about seeing a bunch of self centered shallow suburbanites get their comeuppance ... even if that comeuppance is a nerve gas Apocalypse.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Emma (played by the comely Erinn Hayes) and Pete (Blaise Miller) Mandrake throw only the best Sunday brunches.  Yet this week's brunch is going to be a disaster.  Not only are they in the midst of their own full blown marital crisis, but also some terrorists are about to detonate a series of nerve gas canisters across the United States, bringing about an end to life as we know it.  Will the quiche be too hot?  Will everyone like the wine?  Will they have to down it all before the end comes?  Oh, what's a couple of yuppies to do!Surprisingly, I thought IT'S A DISASTER missed more than a few of its marks.  That isn't to say that it's unfunny in any way, because that would be inaccurate.  It's just that, given the premise and the cast   including David Cross, Julia Stiles, America Ferrara, and more   I think I expected a bit more.  Many moments felt like they should've been played a bit bigger   a big more obtuse   and, instead, they're scaled back almost to the point that one wonders if everyone showed up knowing their lines.  Or was this a case of dialogue being manufactured on the set, and the players were only provided with the talking points?  It's hard to say, though I'd be remiss if I didn't underscore a bit of disappointment.There are some truly brilliant pieces in here.  Berger himself dons a hazmat suit and shows up uninvited to the dinner party as snooping neighbor, Hal; he's the one that breaks the news about the attacks.  Rachel Boston and Kevin M. Brennan are splendid as Lexi and Buck Kivel (respectively), a husband and wife team so completely comfortable with their own generous sexuality they want to share it with anyone they can (which almost includes David Cross's Glen in a wacky development).  And the occasional still shot of the dead latecomers to the party on the front steps   along with an jazzortment of dead crows   is increasingly funny as it's played so wondrously deadpan.  I can't help but wonder if IT'S A DISASTER started out as a stage play   all of the action takes place inside the house, though spread out across several rooms   but I've no doubt thinking that this is exactly the kind of film that when it gets remade will probably find a much bigger and much more appreciative audience.It's definitely worth a view.  Maybe not an owner.  But definitely worth a view.IT'S A DISASTER is produced by Vacationeer Productions, Attainment Media Group, ARM Entertainment (II), Gordon Bijelonic   Datari Turner Films, and Tip Top Productions.  DVD distribution is being handled through Oscilloscope Laboratories.  As for the technical specifications, it all looks and sounds very solid, though there were a few instances when recording levels seemed a bit off.  Fans will be surprised to find a wealth of special features, including a commentary track and even a Comic Con Panel appearance.  It's a nice jazzortment for a nice middle of the road comedy.RECOMMENDED.  It's more benign comedy than it is outright farce, and, as a consequence, IT'S A DISASTER misses some of the true laughs because so much of it is underplayed.  Still, there's an awful lot of talent in there, so much so that I would've expected better.  This may've been the case of a writer director being too close to the material to see the weaknesses in the performances; it could've used a few more manic highpoints   especially given the subject matter   and a little less routine shtick of twentysomethings trying to figure out who they are.

"I still enjoy this show and the great characters.  Season 2 had a nice progression from season 1 and had many great episodes.  Great cinematography, great acting.However, for me, some of the stories (scripts) didn't ""sizzle"" like in season 1.  What I mean by that is that too many scripts deal with Mary and her inner circle drama, (mother, sister, boyfriend issues) and not on the individual cases she is working on, and the state   problems of the people she is trying to protect.I hope the producers can bring some new writers on board and continue to make this a great series, while shaking things up a bit and trying new plot threads.For example, instead of Mary and Marshall always being in Albuerquerque (I probably mis spelled that)....have them fly all over the U.S., being in different states, with different shot locations, working on separate cases sometimes, with multiple plot threads.  Some episodes I would leave un solved, or unsolvable...because that is reality in law enforcement.  Have a few ""cold cases"" that aren't resolved until the end of the season, for example.Can't wait for season 3 in summer 2010!

"First off, let me say, I am not a fan of hand held first person POV movies. It started off with the Blair Witch Project, and I have hated films like it ever since. But something about the trailer to this one looked interesting, and I'm glad I didn't turn my nose up at this one now. V H S starts off with the POV cam type of thing where a few guys are smashing things up, and preying on women by ganging up on her and forcing her to allow them to expose her body on cam. I think it was something about them getting paid to do that for money to sell it to internet site perverts and sickos, or something about that. I have a feeling this might be why so many reviews here are for 1 star, because at this point of the movie I was ready to turn it off too and dismiss this as being a POS if this was what the movie was going to be about.Luckily I held in there and got past that crap, and the story gets better as these guys are asked to break into a house somewhere and steal a VHS tape. These idiots record themselves doing this, but that's when this thing starts to get better. As a couple of the guys explore this house looking for a specific tape, another one is left to view what tapes have been left around to try and figure out which tape it is this person who has asked for it wants.One by one they start watching a tape left in this house, and it then shows the footage of what is on the tapes. Each tape is something different, that is horrific, weird and paranormal. It's kind of like little short horror movies, each being different, but each being shot from a hand held camera, or vacation type of video.It ranges from a couple of voyeurs who try to expose the wrong girl, to a couple on vacation who probably should have given a kid a ride, next is a Blair Witch knock off of a killer who can't be filmed for some reason, to a haunted house where something strange is happening upstairs. I think there was more?Overall, by the end of the film, I thought it was a pretty decent movie. It didn't try to claim the footage was supposedly real, so I went in without that seed of wanting to roll my eyes at everything and say &#34;who are these filmmakers trying to kid?&#34; but surprisingly I'm saying the opposite to what I often think of a lot of movies, and that is the first half of this movie is not so great, but the second half picks up and really goes full steam ahead with some decent short stories.the end scene is a bit of a let down, as it pretty much had the same ending as Blair Witch, which by the way, did I mention I fricken hate that #1 over hyped P.O.S? Or does #1 go to Paranormal Activity? Hmmm... hard choice. So by saying that, if you too hated those movies, and these Cloverfield kind of shot films, then take my word and just give this one a go. Maybe skip the first 10 minutes or so, it's useless footage if you ask me, but once the ball starts rolling, you might be like me and actually find that there is a lot more here then just an attempt at a cheaply made movie. I don't think this one was as cheap as some people might think?Actually, I think I know what it is that makes me like this more than the other ones I mentioned now... it's probably because it actually shows things, whether it be by SFX, CGI or camera tricks, at least they show you kills, ghosts, and decent FX shots. Unlike Blair Witch or P.A movies where you expect to see something, and there is nothing there to see but someone being thrown across the screen on wires and you are expected to be scared simply by noise effects and screaming. This one shows the lot, and is an enjoyable ride to the end.Give a rent or DL at least before dismissing it as just another cheap attempt at low budget horror.",Better than expected.,1362787200,"03 9, 2013",3,0
"Even though I don't particularly like this show, I seem to be just as captivated as a large number of others (according to the reviews) when it comes to finding out how and where this ""dome"" came from. I'm convinced the main story line is more about morality and crowd mentality that anything else, the intersection of perhaps good and evil concepts in our daily lives, and how people respond to and are influenced by the people around them. I'm not really enjoying the program, but once you spend time getting to know the characters, of course you want to know what happens next. The latest episode was a bit dreary and didn't hold together as well as some of the earlier episodes, but perhaps this just can't keep going much longer. There isn't enough plot left for me to really care, so I may wait until a grand finale comes along before I watch it again. Not the best sic fi in my estimation, but the premise is interesting and the actors are all strong, they stay within their characters. Some of the younger characters seem a bit too gullible and not asking enough questions about why people in general are not helping solve the puzzle of where the dome came from and why it is there, which leaves out 98% of the residents of the town, which means you see a great deal of the main characters, some group gatherings, a few peripheral others, and have no idea what the majority of people are doing to deal with the unpleasant consequences of being confined within this impossible dome surrounding miles of the town. I'm not entirely sure how large the town is, or how much territory the dome surrounds. Maybe that is part of the whole point of the series: what does it mean, who are the residents, and what if anything are the people doing to get rid of the dome?",Kept me watching,1405468800,"07 16, 2014",3,0

The show plays more like a    surprise!    game show (which is what Blues Clues and Super Why! both essentially are).Plus, there's a big fundamental problem with the concept:Because the protagonist (Bianca) can grant any wish she likes, there's no real conflict anywhere in the show or in any possible story.  If something goes terribly wrong anywhere in an episode, we're aware that Bianca can ultimately wish the problems away.For instance, when the little boy says he wishes he wasn't afraid and Bianca turns to camera and says, ""He wishes he wasn't afraid.  What should we do?""  Well, the obvious answer is for Bianca to grant his wish to not be afraid.  Instead, she inexplicably refrains from doing so.  Why?  Because if she did grant his wish to not be afraid, then that would be the end of the story.The way to play this beat in a more interesting and dramatic fashion is to have Bianca attempt to grant the boy's wish, only to have the wish backfire so that now he's even more afraid to go onstage    in fact, because of Bianca's wishing error, he's now petrified.  As a result, Bianca has to decide if she should risk wishing yet again for the boy not to be afraid.  What if the wishing goes doubly wrong?  That's when she decides to help the boy by taking direct action, in a real world way that kids at home can relate to, instead of by attempting another wish.To make the show truly dramatic, her wishing should have as many negative consequences as positive, so that you then have recurring conflict in the plot and an actual story to tell and a theme to explore    instead of these little disconnected and relatively conflict free vignettes.As it now stands, the few times Bianca brews up her wishing, it's merely for comedic effect.  Never for conflict or drama.  A huge story telling engine totally squandered!

"I caught this film as a free sneak peak on HDNET in my home theater a week or so ago and it does seem to play better on a big screen. For a film called ""Monsters"", this film shows very little of them. This may have helped the film to created some atmosphere when the land roaming octopus with squid like tentacles is shown, but the acting and dialogue aren't good enough to carry the film. I wasn't a big fan of 'Cloverfield because they used the POV camera in ways that didn't seem natural and if they had used the POV camera in that film like they did here, it would have been a better movie. The POV camera works, when used as a tool and not the sole viewpoint in a film. A good example of this is 'Quarantine or {REC}.I did like the atmosphere when the monsters are on screen as there is a haunting quality about these huge things. For there size they didn't make much noise and they seem to come out of the black sky eerily! It's effective, but where a film like 'District 9' had too much over the top mayhem, this film is a little too tame. I think it's a film worth seeing, but it isn't anything I would watch more than twice. I think that horror and sci fi films like all the films I mentioned above(including this film)are all worthy entries in the two genres as they are taking a new avenue to the cljazzic atmospheric tales that scared me as a kid, rather than just being gory or full of jolt shocks to make up for lack of story.","NICE TRY, BUT NEVER REACHES GREATNESS!",1289952000,"11 17, 2010",3,0

"Six people become trapped in a storage facility with a deadly alien creature hot on their trail in STORAGE 24. STORAGE 24 commits high treason against Horror fans by sticking to a bland and predictable storyline that rarely strays from modern convention. Not one of its unlikeable characters ever come close to resembling a hero, as we are left to suffer through their petty drama in the hopes that each of them will be soon be dispatched. Johannes Roberts fails to inject any energy or suspense in to the picture, with the minimal amounts of action being weighed down by each dialog heavy (but substance free) scene. The only minor success is in the creature design, itself, whose sinewy, insect like appearance scores a few points for originality. Otherwise, STORAGE 24 is a downright boring viewing experience that fails to elicit any form of response in the viewer.

"I have to give Jennifer Garner credit for playing a despicable character in sheep's clothing with such unfettered brio in this 2012 comedy, one that aspires to be a darkly eccentric political satire but ultimately becomes too soft centered for its own good. That outcome is a real shame since the stellar cast is obviously quite game for something edgier, the women in particular, and the scabrous tone works well for at least the first half of the movie. Director Jim Field Smith and first time writer Jason Micallef certainly make their political proclivities clear with their broad caricature of corn belt values and status hungry elitists who intend on attaining power any way they can. With her constantly pinched voice, crisp color coordinated outfits, perfect hair and make up and a triple strand of pearls strung tightly around her neck, Garner is obviously playing Laura Pickler as an amalgam of Sarah Palin and Michelle Bachman but with a more naked malevolence toward anyone who stands in her way toward the White House.Even though her congenial husband Bob, the Iowa State Fair's 15 time butter sculpting champion, is asked by the judges to bow out of the latest competition, Laura is not about to relinquish her powerful position as queen of the fair and decides to enter the contest herself. However, she faces unexpected competition from a ten year old African American child named Destiny, who has been moving from one foster home to another with her packed suitcase in tow. She somehow maintains a level head about her life as she tries to figure out what her true talent is. The answer lies in butter. For most of the first hour, the film provides a lot of easy laughs at the expense of Middle America conservatism and Tea Party stereotypes. It was clever to cast Ty Burrell since he plays Bob as a slightly duller variation on his cljazzic portrayal of dimly lit Phil onModern Family, but he's quickly relegated to the sidelines here. The first butter sculpting contest is set up quite amusingly with the addition of two other contestants: Carol Ann, a devoted fan girl of Bob's played with ditzy dexterity by Kristen Schaal (30 Rock), and a vengeful, hard edged stripper named Brooke, who is waiting for a $600 payment from Bob for services rendered.As an unsavory character who wants desperately to annihilate Laura's dreams of higher status, Olivia Wilde is a genuine comic revelation who almost steals the entire movie as Brooke. Having just seen her as the overly patient, put upon girlfriend inPeople Like Us, I am surprised at how bracingly funny she is here in her 180 degree turn as a foul mouthed nihilist trying to look tough riding on a girl's bicycle. Playing what has to be considered the too good to be true Obama figure, Yara Shahidi brings quiet depth to Destiny and makes her feeling of isolation palpable even as her foster parents show their unconditional love for her. As the liberal minded couple who take her into their home, Rob Corddry (Seeking a Friend for the End of the World) tamps down his antic comic style just enough to resonate, while Alicia Silverstone (Clueless) makes a welcome return as the one likeable grown woman in the story. Although the movie has a sharper edge than ""The Campaign"", Micallef's screenplay reaches a certain point where you begin to realize that there is little to Laura's motivations beyond her small minded ambition.It's at this juncture in the story that Hugh Jackman shows up as her former flame Boyd Bolton, a successful car dealer who still holds a torch for Laura and colludes with her to ensure her victory at the fair. In only a few scenes, Jackman hams it up considerably, especially in a silly prayer scene. Phyllis Smith (Bad Teacher), on the other hand, has a few sharply funny moments as the continually flummoxed contest moderator. The final showdown feels rather repetitive with little variety in the build up of suspense and a denouement that feels far too predictable and contrived to make the story's resolution feel like it was earned. Nevertheless, the central concept of butter sculpture as the means of driving the absurdist plot somehow works. Seeing all the blocks of yellow lard turn into hilariously inappropriate creations like Schindler's List, T Rex Eating Girl, The Last Supper, and even JFK's jazzjazzination provides the film's biggest laughs. At the same time, in a dilemma that it shares with ""The Campaign"", I just wish the filmmakers maintained their initial audacity all the way through instead of slapping on an ending that lets the story sputter out insipidly.",Butter Sculpting as a Political Metaphor Yields Good Laughs Upfront But Fizzles by the End,1347321600,"09 11, 2012",3,0

"Ti West's The Innkeepers (2011) spends most of its time in a small inn, immersing you in a strange reality where the emphasis is on the paranormal.  This slow burn is mostly atmospheric, as not a great deal seems to happen, but if you stick with it, you may be in a receptive frame of mind, for the unsettling conclusion.With a somewhat notorious history, the Yankee Pedlar Inn is about to close.  The establishment is supposedly haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a woman who killed herself in the inn, after being abandoned by her husband.  While the owner is away, employees Luke (Pat Healy) and Claire (Sara Paxton) make up the entire staff for the last few days.  With not much to do, these ghost hunter wannabes pjazz their time looking for evidence of Madeline's presence.  The inn is nearly empty, with actress turned medium Leanne Rease Jones (Kelly McGillis), being one of the final guests.Claire is the more active ghost hunter, and she confides in Rease Jones after a spooked Luke flees from the inn.  With some psychic ability, Leanne is able to offer some jazzistance, as she and Claire venture into the basement, where the ghost is supposed to dwell.  Leanne advises Claire that they need to leave immediately.  Claire attempts to clear out the last of the guests, but discovers that he has already checked out.  Back in the lobby, she finds that Luke has returned, but Leanne is now absent.  The end is near, but will they all survive?The Innkeepers moves at a leisurely pace.  Claire and Luke have so little to do, that even providing fresh towels is a major undertaking.  Mostly free to do as they wish, and seemingly fascinated by ghosts and the paranormal, we come to know them as two different varieties of geek.  Claire is hyper, goofy, clumsy, and often behaves like a child.  Luke has a hairdo like Tin Tin, is something of a cynic, and acts like Claire's smartjazz older brother, although he is actually attracted to her.  Healy and Paxton bring a quirkiness to their roles, which makes them mostly amusing to watch.  Her role as a medium may be something of a clich&eacute;, but even with limited screen time Kelly McGillis manages to bring some credibility to it.With such a substantial buildup, you fully expect a paranormal incident of some kind.  Unfortunately, what occurs may not be quite enough to satisfy.  There are some creepy moments, cheesy jump scares, and decent special effects, but the magnitude of the horror isn't exactly overwhelming, and is sure to have some asking ""Is that it?"", when the film is over.Ti West's approach, reminiscent of some traditional 70's ghost stories, may be a fun change of pace for some.  Although rated R, what happens appears to fall well within the PG13 sphere.  The story holds together fairly well until the end, when the bottom falls out, and the door slams shut on the events at the Yankee Pedlar Inn.","The Innkeepers is a slow atmospheric burn, with quirky characters, that delivers just barely enough of a thrill...",1340841600,"06 28, 2012",3,0

"&#34;Zero Charisma&#34; was a crowdsourced film, presumably by geeks who long to see a role playing game true to the spirit of gamers everywhere. The good news is that &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; gets a lot of things right.  The bad news is it gets so many things right that there are several plot threads that are never really resolved that make for an unsatisfying ending.Scott Weidemeyer (Sam Eidson) is the old school game master everyone loves to hate.  If you've ever played Dungeons & Dragons, you know him well: the DM who house rules everything, argues on message boards, gets thrown out of hobby stores, and rules over his players with an iron fist. Scott's not particularly lucky with the ladies, but he&#8217;s got a place to game (his grandmother&#8217;s house) and he&#8217;s not afraid to use it.The players around the table are all gaming archetypes: the hopeless nerd, the aspiring creative types, the guy with a family who is constantly battling with his spouse over his game time. When that player realizes that it&#8217;s the game or his spouse, he gives up the game.  Worse, Scott's mom has returned and has plans to take over his grandmother&#8217;s house and move her into a home. Scott's sweet gaming pad is about to disappear. Reality, in essence, comes crashing into the long standing fantasy world Scott has so meticulously created.Thus begins a quest to find a new player.  This is no easy feat, and there are plenty of opportunities to sneer at younger generations of players who came to D&D; fantasy tropes by way of World of Warcraft.  In the end, it&#8217;s a different archetype that finds his way into the gaming group: the hipster douche in the form of Miles (Garrett Graham).This new breed of gamer has a successful career in a creative field, runs a popular blog, has a hot girlfriend, and treats D&D; like a fun past time the same way other people treat a card game.  He doesn&#8217;t take it too seriously.Mile's acceptance in the group soon overshadows Scott, who inevitably finds himself compared to someone with much higher Charisma&#8230;and failing the opposed roll.  Miles is everything Scott is not, and it&#8217;s not long before this rift comes to a head that involves a Gary Gygax stand in, a philosophical argument over the purpose of playing role playing games, and a lot of heavy metal.The problem with &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; is that because of how it was edited, it shambles unevenly along. Considerable attention is paid to glances from Mile's girlfriend, who at one point appears to be flirting with our anti hero. This plot point goes nowhere, despite the camera frequently zooming in on her expressions.  There's also a lot of emphasis on people filming the climactic battle between Miles and Scott that again, goes nowhere.The climax, which takes place at Miles' party, is meant to reveal the true douchery by showing that while Miles is happy to game with the nerds, he doesn&#8217;t really consider them friends.  This isn&#8217;t really so much said as implied, as not all the other players are invited to the party.  It begs the question though: so what? Is it really that big a deal if Miles doesn&#8217;t invite people to hang out socially? Additionally, the rest of the players never find out they weren&#8217;t invited.  What should be a climactic emotional showdown becomes something of a slap fight.Like the film &#8220;Napoleon Dynamite,&#8221; &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; asks what kind of happy ending can there possibly be for the mistfits of the world.  Unlike that film, &#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; has an answer and it&#8217;s not particularly satisfying. Instead of growing as a person, Miles keeps the game the same and just changes out the players.&#8220;Zero Charisma&#8221; is a fun film for gamers, but it could be so much more.

"The Oxford Murders is a quasi sophisticated murder mystery attempting to combine philosophical mathematics with a series of murders. The movie has the feel of an attempt to emulate the Da Vinci Code without the action and excitement.  The writer of the script clearly misused chaos theory in professor Seldom's lecture. Being able to predict hurricanes has nothing to do with the limitations of mathematics as the script would have us believe, but is rather a failure of our inability to gather enough data points to the precise measurement that is required to make those calculations. Anyway, This is a murder mystery who dun it. As such it is best just to list the characters then to speak profusely about the plot:Martin (Elijah Wood) is an American at Oxford wanting to be sponsored by the famous Arthur Seldom. He is a border at Ms. Eagleton.Arthur Seldom, retired professor, author of philosophical mathematics. WWII decoder.Mrs. Eagleton  Wife of a colleague of Seldom's. She is in a wheel chair, terminal, and the first victim. Her husband and Mrs. Seldom died in an auto accident some time ago. Seldom apparently rejected Mrs. Eagleton as a would be lover  second wife as he prefers younger women, although they remained close friends.Beth, Ms. Eagleton's daughter and caretaker. She inherits her mother's wealth. She is in love with Martin, throws herself at him, and he rejects her. She plays a cello and is clearly unbalanced, imagining a relationship with Martin that does not exist.The guy who studies with Martin  He is also a bit crazy. He hates Seldom and claims his ideas have been stolen. For some reason his lips clearly don't match what he is saying most of the time.Nurse  She works in a hospital that Arthur Seldom goes to frequently to visit old sick colleagues. She throws herself at Martin and they become lovers. Later we find out she was once Arthur Seldom's lover. She is familiar with his work and writes murder mysteries.Crazy guy  He believes Jesus came back to revenge his death. He is clearly unbalanced. His daughter is dying in the hospital in need of a lung transplant, but there are no matching donors. He hangs out in the same hospital as the nurse and Seldom and buys books on Pythagorean society.All the characters are interconnected and it would easy to jazzign a motive to each one. There are very minor clues or hints as to what is happening, although nothing that would completely tip who the murderer is...or does it? I will give you a clue that may help you try to figure out what is happening, one scene fuels the next one although it may not seem to.  It is a  butterfly effect, which is what the ""genius"" of this film is about or maybe it is about mathematicians should never write murder mysteries.Nudity, sexual scenes, and language.",JUST ANOTHER MURDER MYSTERY,1287705600,"10 22, 2010",3,0

"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict   I've seen quite a few films now where an Israeli falls in love with a Palestinian and I'm starting to get the sense that, in essence, they're all the same. It's clear from the opening moments how romance between the characters will work out and Strangers does nothing to make me question my notions of these films. It's not a bad movie by any means; the performances are strong and the story makes sense, but there's no drama here because everything they do has been played out by every other film that uses this cross cultural matchup. Granted, it's rife with political baggage, but it seems like these films are afraid to actually approach the politics. Guy Nattiv and Erez Tadmor, the writer director combo of Strangers, appear to try to breach those boundaries by using the Israeli attack on Lebanon, but it winds up only being used as a roadblock to their romance instead of the drama it might have had. Eventually, these films all feel like Romeo and Juliet knockoffs played during modern times, pushing aside any actual relevance for the rote progression of a romance film.Still, Strangers is a decent filmed, well made and solidly acted. Even if there's no question as to how the relationship will work out, the performances from Levo and Azabal are strong. They have good chemistry together and it's easy to root for their success, though there's no suspense in the drama to make you wonder. The story is well filmed and there are some interesting soccer sequences that try to parallel the political struggles going on outside of Berlin, which the lovers see and deal with together, but none of it ever gels into anything substantial or all that interesting.Strangers comes to us from Zeitgeist Films in a very standard package. The anamorphic image is nothing spectacular, but is an adequate image with good detail and colors. The sound is a standard stereo mix with nothing to laud, but nothing to complain about, either. The only extra is a trailer.Strangers is a frustrating film. There's much about it that could have been great, and the setting could have made the politics behind the romance both muted by the distance from the action and more explosive for the same reason. Unfortunately, Nattiv and Tadmor cut the corners on all counts, using the national conflicts to force some personal conflict, but betraying themselves by allowing it to all be okay with a smile. In the end, it's cheap romance that, while competent in all facets, is a film I have a hard time recommending.

"The show starts out strong but the constant, never ending struggle with Lulu (she seriously should have gone to Berkeley and STAYED) and the fact that Nick never gets ahead. Not once.

"Nine Things About the Movie &#8220;Pompeii&#8221;1. The only thing that most people know about Pompeii is that it was an Italian city destroyed by a volcano and buried in ash a long time ago. So this movie makes up the rest of the story.2. The plot of the movie is as generic as you can get. You can almost hear the filmmakers say, &#8220;Well, the event happened in gladiator times. And it&#8217;s about a bunch of people who can&#8217;t escape where they are and they all get killed. So let&#8217;s make &#8216;Gladiator&#8217; meets &#8216;Titanic&#8217;. And even though it&#8217;s in Italy, let&#8217;s make everybody talk with a vague sort of British accent.&#8221;3. And that&#8217;s exactly what they did. It&#8217;s your basic poor boy rich girl story. It&#8217;s about a boy named Milo that is captured in war, becomes a slave, and then is sent to Pompeii to fight as a gladiator. While there, he meets Cjazzia, the daughter of the city ruler. They fall in love. Her dad is upset. The usual.4. Meanwhile, the volcano starts acting up. For some reason, it only happens at night, like the volcano was some serial killer, and people start disappearing.5. Besides the love story, there is a half baked political subplot.. Since we all know how the movie ends, the story is not only silly, it&#8217;s pointless. There&#8217;s no reason to care much about the characters.6. The last half hour of the film is all about the destruction of the city. It&#8217;s pretty cool to watch, and the 3D effects are well done.7. The director did take a lot of time to make the city itself historically accurate, basing it on studies of the actual ruins. Historians give the movie points for this.8. Scientists who study volcanoes say that the depiction of the volcano is also historically accurate, except for when it rains fireballs.9.

"I gave this a three because it's just nice to see something other than Vampires and Zombies on TV, BUT: I wanted to like this show but I found some of the premises of the show unbelievable, and then there was the acting and or directing.SPOILERS:1. ISSUES WITH THE PREMISE: The basic plot premise is that Elena is the ONLY WOMAN EVER to have survived being bitten. We were told that women weren't strong enough to survive the change. Well, okay, I didn't like that    women survive childbirth which involves spreading open and moving internal body parts to expel a baby, and we survive that, but we can't survive the first change. Disappointing, but that's the author's premise. Then there's Elena  she survives the change. And does first villain want to capture her to study her DNA, her blood values, her brain chemistry or any number of other scientific things to figure out how she survived?  NO. He just wants to keep her bare pawed  and pregnant with new little superwolf babies.  Didn't make sense to me.2. ISSUES WITH THE HEROINE: Elena doesn't want to kill   yeah well that's such a clich&eacute;. The entire first season I wanted to shake her and yell GET OVER IT!  Could we not have found a more original conflict issue?  Elena acts the stereotypical female, &#34;I'm so emotional, I can't handle it, I'm going to run away and have normal life no matter what it costs.&#34; GET OVER IT!Her refusal to accept her new reality costs the lives of her pack members and the guy she's supposed to love but that's OK 'cause she's a girl and girls are just like that. &#60;You have no idea how many times I was screaming YOU DWEEBETTE&#62; at the screen. so I found the heroine as portrayed in the TV series to be annoying.3. ISSUES WITH THE FIRST VILLAIN: The rich coward who uses others to do his dirty work. Of course, our current meme is that anyone who is rich has to be a coward who uses others to do his dirty work.  And I admit at times I hallucinated a mustache on the villain and saw him twirl it and go, BWA ha ha.4. ISSUES WITH THE CAST DIRECTION: Never mind that the woman chosen to play Elena is a stereotype in herself. (All that blonde hair and big sad blue eyes), I'm used to casting directors choosing actors who look like Barbie models. But so many of the actors in this series gave me the feeling that they were just phoning it in. Now I have to believe that there are some fine actors in the cast, so I wonder at why everyone's performance seemed just a step or two down from what it should have been. Did they not believe in their part? Is the director doing it deliberately? Was the cast chosen to be understated and they are too understated? I don't know, but I had the feeling that sometimes they just wanted to be home on their real couch drinking a beer.4.  STORYLINE DRAWN OUT TOO LONG:  I skipped some of the middle episodes because I was so bored waiting for the big battle.Look I can't speak to the novels, I haven't read them. And I've noted that those who have are not particularly happy with the changes themselves. And whoever decided that women couldn't shape shift really took a lot of the fun out of it for me.

"I've never been a big fan of Eli Roth. I know many think of him as the new face of horror but most of his movies to me have amounted to minor of the plot story with a focus on the gore. I have no problem with gore in movies, but gore for gore's sake gets boring after a while and for me most of his films have been that, boring. So when I heard his name connected with this film I viewed it with trepidation. Once I found out he wasn't directing I felt better. In the end, we have a decent movie here that offers some chills along the way from start to finish.The movie takes place in Chile where three friends (one played by Roth who gets a co writing credit on the film too) and business partners are enjoying the night life that the city they're in has to offer. One of the three is Chilean so he speaks the language. Moving from club to club, night spot to night spot, the three end up connecting with three women and the six of them carry on with the partying. So much for about 30 minutes of the film. It's not quite enough time to make us care about the group or perhaps it's the antics that involve them but when things change we care.While in one of the clubs a huge earthquake hits and panic follows. The required amounts of gore and blood flow as people are crushed beneath the columns and pillars that decorate the club they're in. One of the friends has his arm crushed and as the group gets out they begin to search for the nearest hospital. When they hit the streets the amount of devastation confronts them as they roam the city seeking help while dealing with the looting and rioting that follow each aftershock.But that's not enough jeopardy to put this group in. Someone mentions that there was a prison nearby that housed the worst of the worst, the nastiest killers the country had to offer. So on top of trying to find help and dealing with the wreckage around them they now must try and decipher who is safe to trust and who might be one of these mentally disturbed prisoners.This adds a nice touch to what could have been a rather standard disaster film. The group does their best to make it through but along the way is hunted down by the escaped prisoners. Just who will and won't make it through the night becomes the question that follows them from street to street. As would be expected, not all of them will survive. Who does and doesn't adds to the suspense (limited though it may be) and moves the story from point A to point Z. All would be fine with the exception of the ending (which I won't spoil but saw coming a mile away), which makes this film a part of the sort of movie Roth would make. If you don't understand that comment I won't ruin the ending for you.Not great acting but pjazzable, some decent gore effects and a well shot film. The story moves along at a snails pace to start but picks up once the earthquake hits. If you're not a fan of Roth then there is one piece in this you will love. On the whole this is a movie worth watching if you like disaster or horror films. If you don't like either or are planning a trip to Chile, I'd pjazz this one by.",TERROR AFTER THE QUAKE,1393372800,"02 26, 2014",3,0
"This is the 1st time I've seen this seris and my jaw is on the ground.  In law school, they teach that conspiracies are worse than crimes committed by single actors.  There's a multiplier effect on the evil and efficiency and effectiveness.  This episode was painful to watch as the murders were so senseless and wicked.  I don't know why this case doesn't get that much attention when the killers are pure garbage just like the DC Snipers and the Atlanta Child Murderer.The couple commit many crimes and the show goes through each of them.  After awhile, it gets irritating.  This was different from a show like ""Forensic Files"" where some scientific truth is the key to getting the killer convicted.  Near the end, we learn a governor commuted the death sentence of the retarded female in the couple.  I think recently the Supreme Court may have ruled that the retarded can't face capital punishment, so this case may have been a forerunner of that.From the 1st minute of the show, I was ready to put these killers up under the jail.

"Here's what you get: the greatest of actors trying to bring to life a mediocre story.  There a few thrilling scenes that you will like.  But the heist plan is lackluster, unnecessarily complicated, with a poetic justice twist in the end that just did not feel that satisfying.The professional criminals make a few stupid mistakes that you probably will not be able to forgive.  Designed to characterize, these mistakes just make them look unprofessional, unpredictable, and kind of silly.  I won't spoil anything, but you'll see a couple when the counterfeiter works on a painting, the wheel man jumps a motorcycle, and the apprentice crosses a border.  Just a few examples.The movie cannot decide if it is a comedy or a heist movie.  The Interpol agent is not funny, but constantly tries to be,  It makes you feel NO TENSION WHATSOEVER that our criminals will be caught.  Jay Baruchel's character delivers some believable comedy  even at the border crossing, but on top of the fumbling Interpol agent, it is just too much.The writers seem to have forgotten that the best stories pit CAPABLE and threatening enemies against heroes.  They wasted a cast of acting giants to put on a semi entertaining Bugs Bunny cartoon.There is a nagging question of trust plaguing the movie throughout, which starts as a point of tension but deteriorates into a eye rolling, annoying situation that should be remedied with a gun.This movie MIGHT keep you attention all the way through, because you will want to see the ending once you get invested.

"I caught some grief with my initial review  with good cause.  I returned and carefully watched all of the first episode and have revised my rating to 3 stars.  It was okay  but formulaic and hurried.  The main female lead's acting began rather stilted but was beginning to improve as the episode progressed.  The predictable ""hunk"" with the 2012 police force, linked with the usual gun battle, the lame interrogation scene, and the gimmicky body suit, left me cold.  The characters needed much more early development so we actually cared about any of them, and were basically one dimensional.  Perhaps subsequent episodes will eventually get to working on this.  Sure, it's science fiction and not expected to be reality based, but the wildly improbable scene where a group execution turned inexplicably into time travel, left me groaning and rolling my eyes.  Way more background leading up to this would have been very welcome to make it more plausible.  The time travelers are a stereotypic group of personality disorderd misfits and, even though they are presumably the ""good guys"", none were in the least bit likeable or sufficiently intelligent to have ever invented time travel.

"The subject matter of this episode is very familiar, I've seen it fictionalized before and even read news stories that were similar. Therefore, in order to make its mark, Elementary has to do it one step better than the previous shows. It has not.Past: A boy leaves his home and is abducted off the street. Balloons are left as a thank you for his parents by the kidnapper. Through the years more children are kidnapped. Some are found dead. Others aren't found at all.Today: A seventh child is abducted from her home. Her parents are abrasive, not sympathetic. Her father left her alone in the house to meet a former lover, and lies about it until Holmes confronts him. The woman he met was a witness to the kidnapping, she saw the escape vehicle. (At a later point the parents even suggest trading the first victim back to the kidnapper to secure the release of their daughter. When their demand is not agreed to, they then threaten to hold the captain responsible for all consequences).Watson manages to be more abrasive intrusive than Holmes himself. The constant sniping and need to have the last word is irritating. Elementary is not improved by this Watson. Unless you appreciate that Holmes finds clues while he is trying to run away from her.The young man who was the first victim many years ago, is discovered driving the kidnapper's van and taken into custody while trying to flee. He refuses to help the police find the kidnapper. He has become attached to the man. This process is carefully explained to us.Holmes shares some of his own ""history"" with the rescued youth during an interview. Interesting tidbit if it is true (Holmes is evasive on the point later). He goes through his lightning quick analysis in a few locations. Very clever. He consistently maintains his emotional distance or does he show actual empathy? He discovers the little clues that others miss. His energy is toned down in this episode. Perhaps he finds listening to Watson as tiring as I do. Whatever the cause, he is less the scene stealer here. Still watchable, tho.The police are a touch too oblivious. They dash into the kidnapper's home, right past balloons in an empty room, then state they have nothing. Until Holmes tells them to go back. They find the incredibly obvious balloons and an attached USB drive. Too much Keystone Cops to be credible.Victim #1 is talked into signing an immunity agreement. In an act of atonement he reveals the kidnapper's new residence. The police bust in and rescue the little girl. The kidnapper commits suicide. The child is unharmed. Uhhhh, really?The psychology is interesting, make no mistake. But there are too many detractions to make this an improvement over the previous episodes of Elementary. Holmes finding a loophole in the immunity agreement is too predictable, not fresh at all. His pitting his wits against the clever young murderer who was Victim #1 is sort of bland.Sure they get their guy in the end, outwitting him. It just didn't quite meet its full potential. 2.75 stars rounded up to 3.

"Oh, man. This was a show I really wanted to love. It has two of my favorite actors, Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy. It has a solid supporting cast with the likes of Natalie Zea, Annie Parrise and Shawn Ashmore. It seemed to have a solid plot.However, in THE FOLLOWING, Fox's latest attempt to get more ""edgy"", it bludgeons the viewer with every single possible cliche in almost every episode. It's a veritable clown car of character tropes, red herrings, laughably bad dialogue, abysmal plotting, and narcoleptic performances.Here's the plot: Ryan Hardy (Bacon) is a former FBI profiler who was once involved with the chase, and ultimately the capture, of charismatic college professor and failed writer (and co ed serial killer) Joe Carroll (Purefoy), whose killings have the shared theme of Edgar Allan Poe style murders. Hardy is wounded badly in the capture and now has a pacemaker. Since the capture, he's drowned himself in alcohol and wrote a book about the Carroll case. Suddenly, Carroll escapes his maximum facility incarceration and intends to continue his murder spree with his ""following""; a cult of various murderous misanthropes who have all been bitten by the crazy bug. Hardy is brought back into the fray, so that Carroll can continue his game of cat and mouse with Hardy, but with Carroll's followers, all who have impossibly played out various roles of importance to Hardy and the people around him, remain one step ahead. It's SILENCE OF THE LAMBS meets The Manson Family.Showrunner Kevin Williamson, who rightly made a name for himself with the SCREAM films, has very little faith in the target audience for a show of this type. It's a consistent insult to the intelligence of those who watch the show as the FBI and Hardy stumble around like the Keystone Kops, feebly attempting to quell the murders, but also to save Carroll's ex wife (Zea) who Ryan is in love with, and Carroll's son. It's as if none of the pursuing forces have more than three or four brain cells functioning at any given time, EXCEPT when the plot requires them to suddenly become brilliant.With maybe the exception of Purefoy, every cast member, especially Bacon, seems to just be cashing a check here. Bacon has never EVER been as dull as his performance is in this show. Even he seems to be asking himself, ""Why am I in this idiotic show?"" as he lumbers from plot point to plot point. Purefoy at least seems like he's having some fun here playing Hannibal Lec... ahem... I mean, Joe Carroll as he chews his way through most of the scenery in the show.So why three stars? Because at the end of every episode, after I've been screaming at the television about how stupid the FBI are, I find myself taken with the idea that the series in and of itself is a long form parody of these types of stories. Williamson was all about playing against the stereotypes while playing with them in SCREAM, and for whatever reason, I believe that this show is somehow totally aware of how bad it is, and is willing to keep making itself more and more idiotic and implausible as the season went on.Either that, or THE FOLLOWING is really one of the worst shows in recent memory. It's probably the latter, but I kind of hope it's the former.",The BEST bad show on television!,1379548800,"09 19, 2013",3,0
"I think everything Debbie Joy said was right.  She hit the proverbial nail on the head when she said it's like watching a train wreck or I could say a police car pulling over someone   you slow down to watch it   morbid curiousity.  I too have seen every episode of Dance Moms   some episodes more than once.  Abby has always, always been a demanding teacher as I've said in previous reviews of previous seasons but it seems that since Hollywood has callin', the woman's ego has no bounds.  I agree with another reviewer who said even though the show is titled &#34;Dance Moms&#34;, Abby seems to think it's all about her & brew everyone else who gets in her way.  There's no mistaking now that Maddy's her one and only fav   &#34;I want a team of Maddys&#34;   a frequent saying of Abby.  I agree with one thing she says and that the kind of studio & competitions she goes to are not just merely an afterschool extra curricular activity, this is serious business of training a child to be a professional performer whether I agree with it or not.  Now why Kelly and Christi insist to call it that means imo that they need to move on but I'm pretty sure that either one or two things   they are under contract to Lifetime and or they too are addicted to fame attention.  I can't imagine a new cast   we've grown to care about Maddy, Mackenzie, Chloe, Nia, Brooke, Paige, and Kendall.  I'm not sure if I left anybody out.  We've grown to gasp almost delightedly with guilty pleasure at the fights between Abby and the moms but it's old, old, old.  It seems that the drama now is 'scripted' and forced.  Dance Moms is numbered   I'm willing to bet the ratings will decline with a new time if they haven't fallen already.  I love the training that Abby gives   the girls dance probably pretty darned perfect because of her eye for technique but the woman can do it without being such a bi*%@.  I know in order to get that kind of response a teacher has to be tough but that's how it started   with Abby being tough.  Now it's on to abuse over inflated ego.

"Seth Rogen is still everybody's favorite stoner; it's just that now he's an old stoner. In the raucous R rated comedy Neighbors, Rogen's character gives in to the phony domesticated bliss that we see guys like Kevin James (name checked in the movie, too!) enjoy in lousy network sitcoms. He's got a great wife played by Rose Byrne who is out of his league, a crappy job, a beautiful newborn child, and a hefty mortgage to contend with. But that urge to light up a fatty is still there, and that dichotomy of the responsible parent who also wants to be one of the guys is what keeps Neighbors interesting even as the puerile jokes run out of gas.Mac (Rogen) and Kelly (Byrne) have just blown their entire savings on a new home in a seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood. They're young, not too far removed from their party hearty days, but now that they've had a daughter the pull of boring domestication is strong. So they feebly try to hang on to their youth with &#34;spontaneous&#34; sex (which the baby ruins), smoking a blunt on occasion (sometimes at work), and planning to go to raves with their friends. It doesn't happen, but the plan was sound.  It's a limbo time for them because neither wants to be all dull and old and stuff. Who does?They're snapped into focus with the arrival of new neighbors, the rowdy dudes of fraternity Delta Psi Beta. At the head of this toga party bound to happen is Teddy (Zac Efron), a chiseled stud Mac breathlessly describes as &#34;something a gay guy designed in a laboratory.&#34; With his loyal co prez Pete (Dave Franco) and a veritable army of fast livin' fraternity brothers at his disposal, Teddy plans to throw a rager worthy of going up in the Hall of Fame. In a pitiful attempt to look cool and hopefully convince the guys to keep the music down, Mac and Kelly make a sticky green peace offering, then hang out at one of the frat's all night blow outs. Shot with ultraviolet energy by Nicholas Stoller, the party scenes are an absolute blast. It doesn't hurt that Rogen gets to act like a clown in them, emphasizing his oafish appearance in contrast to Efron. Ultimately, an agreement is made that if the noise gets unbearable, call the frat first rather than the cops. But when that plan goes up in smoke (pun intended!) and the cops are brought into the situation, Teddy feels betrayed and sets about making Mac and Kelly's lives miserable.The turf war that erupts between this square couple and a bunch of overzealous dudes is more fun than a thousand beer pong matches, at least initially. The jokes, of which there are tons and many of them land like a punch to the jaw, consist of denigrating the yard bushes, exploding whoopee cushions, busted water pipes, and used condoms in the front lawn. There's even an attempt by Mac and Kelly to get the frat suspended by appealing to the university's image conscious dean, played with blas&eacute; attitude by Lisa Kudrow.  It's all innocent and largely harmless shenanigans until things escalate a little too far out of control, and this is when screenwriters Andrew Cohen and Brendan O'Brien lose their way. Things take a turn for the dark side when Mac and Kelly actively set up Teddy's girlfriend to cheat on him, which leads to Teddy taking glee in their marital turmoil later on.  There's nothing funny about that at all, nor is Teddy's later comments about &#34;watching&#34; their young daughter grow up into a woman. As the violence goes from comedic to ugly, Neighbors begins to resemble an entirely different movie, and one this viewer was not especially into. I signed up for Neighbors, not Lakeview Terrace.But when this film is on it's an absolute riot of juvenile, mildly offensive gags with laughs coming a mile a minute. While we've all probably seen the De Niro impersonation scene a thousand times already in TV spots and trailers, it's much funnier in full context, and bit players like Christopher Mintz Pljazze, Carla Gallo, and Ike Barinholz hit the mark. In a way this feels like a coming out party for Efron who has never been asked to carry the comedic load like this before. His Teddy is a snot nosed punk, but one with a touch of complexity. And hopefully this will be the film that finally earns Rose Byrne the attention she has so long deserved. If it wasn't already obvious after Bridesmaids that she is one of today's funniest women alive then Neighbors proves she is a true showstopper. She adds gravitas to a role that could have been overshadowed by Rogen's goofy antics, but instead it's her who gives a towering comedic performance.So what you have is the old couple trying to recapture their youthful vigor, Teddy who sees in them what could be his future. There isn't a ton of time spent on this dynamic but it's enough, and told with enough honesty to be relevant. Most of the work is done by Rogen and Efron in the way their characters interact with one another non verbally. It's clear right away that Mac sees Teddy as the guy he wishes he was back in college. Not that you'll come to Neighbors for poignant insight on growing up. It isn't straining to be much, but as a &#34;bros before hos&#34; flick with some big laughs, Neighbors gets a pjazzing grade.",Big Laughs but Runs Out of Gas,1400976000,"05 25, 2014",3,0
"I would even sit, riveted, to a feminine hygiene commercial ... if Naomi Watts were in it. Both her and Kate Winslet, just tell me either is in a film and my interest IN that film automatically jacks up about 80%.Which is what led me to 'Sunlight Jr.', starring Watts and Matt Dillon (who I also like, with few reservations) and   another BIG bonus!   Norman Reedus. Set in Florida, the film tells the story of a couple, Melissa and Richie (Watts and Dillon) struggling to keep their heads afloat in a depressed economy. Richie, a disabled war vet living on disability, relies too much on the bottle as he feels the frustration of not being the breadwinner, having to watch Melissa go out to work every day at the Sunlight Jr. convenience store. They live in a weekly rental motel, Richie often has to swipe gas from other cars to be able to drive their own beater, and Melissa has her issues at work, dealing with both a lecherous boss and a violent and determined ex (Reedus) who wants her back. Things get even more complicated when Melissa finds out she's pregnant, and the couple have to figure out how to survive, better their lives with a baby on the way.Does this sound like a downer? Guess what? It is. The film plays out nearly every cliche it can grab, about drunken vets, violent exes, drug dealers, a life of poverty in the grungy state of Florida, domesticate abuse, the abuse of the foster care system   good God, you name it. Saved only by the performances of Watts, Dillon and Reedus (especially Watts, you really do grow to care about Melissa   hoping she'll escape this life!), otherwise this collection of cliches has ""mediocre"" written all over it ... and is so depressing, it could make Mary Poppins consider picking up a bottle of sleeping pills.","Really two stars, but Watts/Dillon/Reedus add the third ...",1385683200,"11 29, 2013",3,0

"Lifetime's ""Dance Moms"" fills a specialty niche in reality programming that you either love or you hate.  Season One was a surprise hit for the network, Season Two has further exploded in the ratings, and the network even launched a totally unnecessary spinoff in Miami. (I mean really, how many stage mothers does one need to see highlighted on national television?) That's just it, I'm not a huge fan of putting children into stressful situations on TV and watching their parents straddle the line into exploiting them for profit.  I know it's a fact of the world, but it doesn't always qualify as entertainment for me to see people behaving poorly.  At least ""Dance Moms"" features talented young performers, a strong instructor in Abby Lee Miller, and a no nonsense approach to some of the sillier mom related shenanigans.  There is an unpleasant underbelly to this world of competitive dance.  ""Dance Moms,"" in large part, capitalizes on an unsavory aspect of child rearing.  But for the right reasons, it also showcases talent and drive.  For those distinctions, it's not nearly the purposeful train wreck of the popular ""Toddlers and Tiaras"" which is even more distressing and over the top (even though it might be strangely alluring).As a guilty pleasure, as I said, ""Dance Moms"" will either rock your boat or come across as patently distasteful.  In a given episode, you can expect Abby Lee Miller to push the children (as young as six).  Depending on your viewpoint and experience, you'll think she is motivating them or berating them.  If they want to compete at a national level, this is a fact of competitive sport.  For me, it's hard to be too squeamish about Miller's techniques so most of my disdain is with the parents.  At least one parent will object to her methods and confront her in a staged battle with plenty of bleeped foul language.  I don't particularly like the aspect of the dance world and the show that sexualizes children either (some of the moves are designed for provocation and sexiness).  To have their kids participate in Miller's program is a huge physical, emotional, and financial stress to the families involved.  The ultimate question in ""Dance Moms"" tends to ask if it is worth it.Season One is comprised on 12 real episodes and a Most Outrageous Moments special.  On four discs, this comes to just over 9 hours of programming.  The Bonus Features also include additional footage, but I'm not sure that anything included will actually enhance your viewing experience.  If you know what ""Dance Moms"" is and you love it, obviously you'll want to pick up the release of Season One.  While my rating straddles the middle ground, my comments are made to give new viewers an idea of what the show is and how it plays out.  If you're on the fence about whether it is right for you, I suggest you find a rerun on Lifetime or even check out an episode on on demand (they have it here on instant video) to see if you like it.  As a train wreck guilty pleasure, there are certainly worse shows on TV but I still don't like getting kids involved.

"When you're dealing with a musical entity as mjazzive as The Beatles, you typically have an idea of the type of response you're going to get. Even to this day, nearly everybody enjoys The Beatles or at least appreciates their contributions to the music industry. At their peak, The Beatles were the biggest phenomenon music has ever seen and were globally recognized as such. Not many fans can say they were there at the beginning, the end, during all the travesties that hit home, through the thick and the thin, to celebrate their most lucrative accomplishments, and everything in between. But one woman named Freda Kelly was there during all of it and for the first time in her 50 year career as a secretary, she's an open book regarding her 11 year stint as the lifelong secretary for The Beatles and it's all documented in Ryan White's documentary, ""Good Ol' Freda.""What's really appealing about ""Good Ol' Freda"" is that not only are you getting a fan's perspective of the birth and demise of the biggest foursome to ever hit music, but Freda managed to have a bird's eye view regarding everything concerning the band. She knew each member personally, was friends with each of their parents, and was the main source of communication between the band and their families back home while they were touring. Freda just had a normal job with extraordinary circumstances.During the film's 86 minute duration, you're taken from the band's incarnation in Liverpool in 1961 to The Beatles going their separate ways in the late 60s to Freda's resignation from Apple Records in 1972 due to wanting to start a family of her own. Freda reveals fascinating details regarding the job she acquired at the tender age of 17. She mentions the countless times she used to see The Beatles perform at The Cavern Club with Pete Best, the drummer before Ringo Starr, starting the official fan club, witnessing The Beatles play at the Empire Theatre and knowing that they finally made it, being there through Beatlemania, having to dodge questions regarding the relationships of the band members, and enjoying every minute of what would be a dream job for just about anyone.The really admirable part of Freda's story is that she always stayed true to herself, the band, and her profession. She's not rich and didn't sell anything Beatles related to anyone. In fact, she gave most of the merchandise she did own away in 1974 by personally handing most of it to Beatles fans. When she was offered money to give details regarding the relationship status of the band members, Freda politely refused. She'd personally go out of her way to get The Beatles to sign autographs for fans and even catered to absurd demands from fan letters including sending locks of hair or having one of them sleep on someone's pillow case before sending it back. Freda had an incredible story to tell and it's quite shocking that she's sat on it for this long.Despite being extremely informative for its short length, ""Good Ol' Freda"" feels like it ends a little too soon. The documentary kind of fizzles out once it gets to the band members going their separate ways. Obviously being a Beatles secretary, information was probably pretty scarce on Freda's end especially since she was starting a family during that time. But it would've been nice to hear a bit more about that portion of The Beatles' lives. Were the members happy to be touring as a solo act? Did they miss the glory days of being together as a full band? Did they keep in touch? These are things that aren't covered in the film. On the surface, it seems like a different story but at the same time you find yourself wanting to know more about that segment of their lives since you just learned so much about the first 11 years of their career.""Good Ol' Freda"" feels like a peek behind the curtain of one of the biggest bands in history. Freda was practically considered family by the Apple Records crew and even The Beatles themselves. If this is the last true story of The Beatles, then it's a remarkable tale full of magnificent triumphs, devotion, sorrow, and maturity.",A common perspective of The Beatles' career,1380240000,"09 27, 2013",3,0
"Shameless! At least, that's sort of how I envision a trailer for this flick   a throwback to the days where scene clips were overprinted with salacious and titillating titles. &lt;g>Talk about old school. Charles Bronson must be smiling somewhere as 70's and 80's anti hero crime fighters have made a comeback of sorts.Funny thing is, when these low budget monstrosities were new and headlining theaters, I hated them. Pointless bloody messes whose moronic plots screamed ""Exploitation!"" with a capital 'E' and exclamation slammer. But now I see them for what they always were: Silly, ridiculous and staged for laughs   essentially live action versions of 'Itchy & Scratchy'.Interestingly, this retro groove has found a new life in amongst the studio processed glop of the 21st century, pushing it's way back into the mainstream pipeline.'Hobo' encapsulates the very best of these elements and blasts them across modern digital screens. From the opening credits clunky font and electro disco esque soundtrack, to the all important cherry red blood sputtering scenes. All the while making sure to sidestep morality or any sense of reality   this is supposed to be fun.While I still don't quite 'get' the entire genre that was once dominated by B movie specialist actors like the late Robert Ginty, schlock movie actor producer Andrew Stevens,  and the crew from Tromaville   there's something fascinating about any culture that revels in such cheap indulgent entertainment. In fact, almost the entirety of Bollywood is made up of this kind of vapid throwaway flick.Not interested in a cultural debate, so I'll say that if you've ever harbored the desire to take up vigilantism against a streaming horde of rotten unholy nogoodnicks   then this is your flick. &lt;g>Again, I still do not enjoy these kinds of productions, but I greatly appreciate the intentional artistry and clever stylistic revamp. It's not easy doing a period piece, even if that period was full of crap.Ultimately, I'm happy for my man Rutger Hauer. Always pleased he gets the nod from producers as I know he'll get a nice payday.Movie Notes:  Directors producers of these kinds of blood n gore productions are accurately portrayed by Steve Martin in the sublime 1991 film ""Grand Canyon"". Watch it and you'll get a peek into the business of filming these kinds of flicks.  If you enjoy the modern grindhouse, I highly recommend catching ""Drive Angry"" with Nick Cage.

"The overall theme is what happens in a future society that uses technology to enhance the connection between the common person and those pedestal statured special people. This behavior is prevalent in all cultures   an obsessive fascination with anything celebrity and successful. The emulation and fanaticism is most obvious in sports where bizarre mindless mobs dress and scream their iconic team to success while believing that that success is now their personal own achievement.The movie shows this obsession taken to the extreme where the common person pays to be injected with whatever disease (e.g. herpes) their idol is currently experiencing to further strengthen their bond.Well acted, appropriate sets. Only weakness is a bit of obscurity in how the script and visuals conveys this theme to the viewer and also a little too slow of a pace.

"""Blue Caprice"" is a docu drama about the DC sniper. It starts with a teen boy in the Caribbean and goes from there. He meets up in the US with his paranoid father uncle guy who has a grudge against the system that separates him from his children. He uses the boy to enact revenge.The film doesn't have a lot of action. It is mostly a drama, a means to provide some closure for those who ask ""why?"" The killing scenes are not overly graphic and in many cases they jump over them as well as skip scenes such as the actual arrest and taking them into custody.The acting was good although Lee (Tequan Richmond) didn't have a lot of lines and seemed to have lost his island accent by the end of the film. I found the film interesting as a biography of the killers, but overall lacking in shear entertainment value.

"A probe is shot into space and, from it, things start to spawn. Monsters soon own a nice portion of our world and, from it, a contaminated zone is form. In this setting you have our two main characters who, through some unlucky bits and some not so wise bits, end up crossing through some really bad country while trying to get back to the states.As far as the movie went, it could have been something. The layout of this seemed epic, with the effects pointing out just how mjazzive this could be. The monster impacts on the movie were great, too, and they seemed like they could really be walking those areas they hit. When I saw the first one in the water, for example, I kept thinking how much they should be feared. And more explanation is given on them and that keeps a person watching   and wondering.My main problem was in the ending of this movie and in the characteriszation. When you see this, recall that one of your characters is a photographer that talks about needing money. When great photos show themselves, however, he seems to shy away. I'm talking about stuff that isn't morally gray, either, but that involves monsters and water or other things. This portrayal doesn't say the man is remotely good at what he does. Then the ending pops up and, well, it takes forever. The people stumble around and it feels like something is going to happen but that happening takes around 15   20 minutes. This really hurts the movie alot and takes a thing I would have rated a 4 back to a three.Is it watchable? It depends. It is something that doesn't ever show you the monster and that seems to want to pjazz enviromental judgment on society. In fact, this is a message in a bottle with a hammer to guide you. I personally found that less enlightening and a little bossy, going beyond the screen. Still, it wasn't something I regret watching. I enjoyed parts of it and, al told, I thought parts were great.

"I remember when this show firsts started airing. 3 guys with their camera's went out alone to try to find evidence of paranormal activity. Usually the first 30 minutes of the show would be them getting a back history on the place and the new 20 25 minutes of them doing the actual investigation, and then the last 5 10 minutes of them reviewing what they caught and following up with people. I watched the show off and on over the years but the later season seems pretty different. It's not just them alone going into places anymore they have people that review the footage, and the dialogue the crew says sometimes just seems so scripted. Actually in this episode Zak seems like he's acting. Way different than the enthusiasm the group kind of showed in earlier episodes when going into places and the unscripted dialogue and them genuinely being surprised. Maybe by now they've been enough places and experienced enough activity that things don't interest them the same as they did before. Zak actually seems kind of strange now and the rest of the group seems pretty worn down. Makes you wonder where Television Entertainment and Reality Split. Has the experiences they've had over the years effected them personally and changed them or is it just an act for the show. Who knows... either way I like the Ghost Adventurers the show was always cool to me but like everything that gets popular it changes and stops being interesting after a while.

"I'm kind of on the fence with this one.  Going into a flick called ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" you know your not getting ""Mary Poppins"".  You have to expect buckets of blood, gore, and bullet casings.  In order for a flick like this to work there has to be a certain ironic and tongue in cheek sense of humor.  Director Jason Eisener tries hard perhaps too hard.  He lays the bloodshed on so heavily that after a while you become immune to it but not particularly moved by it.  His effort strikes me as that of a student filmmaker attempting a homage to grindhouse.  This is not to say that there's not some things to recommend the film.  I thought the Plague were a bloodchilling and inspired touch.  Though most of the acting is strictly amateur hour, not entirely a bad thing, Rutger Hauer's presence gives the film gravitas.  In a subtle turn, Hauer with his weathered visage projects a man who is mad as hell and is not going take it anymore.

THat being said I am sure many people were not happy that the movie is all taking place in jungle territory and northern mexico is all desert and mountains!

No giant screens to block sunlight and such but still having no script and no idea what you want is not the best way to make a movie.

"In a small village in Western Ireland, a fisherman named Circus (Colin Farrell) finds one day on the net of his fishing barge a woman who calls herself Ondine (Polish actress Alicja Bachleda Curus). The woman is disoriented and refuses to see other people. He gets her living arrangements in a old shack that belonged to his deceased mother. He tends to believe she is a mythical creature called a Selkie, a mermaid like creature from Irish folklore. She encourages him to believe this.

"I had high hopes for this show, but now I see that it has been cancelled and will only run for 13 episodes. Sadly I am not completely surprised. This show really tries, and I think for many, it does not move fast enough. I was hoping also that since Terry O'Quinn from Lost was featured, that it would have more to offer, but I like O'Quinn's character and the rest of the cast in fact. That is the only reason that I keep watching. I like strange and creepy shows like this, and have been since the days of Twilight Zone, One Step Beyond, The Outer Limits, Lost, Fringe, etc. I do like the setting for this show; a haunted old building called the Drake converted to an upscale apartment complex, and modern tenants confronted with the paranormal.

"I love the series. It is engaging and a lot of fun. However, the blu ray edition and my Sony blu ray player do not get along. I suspect the player is the problem and not this set. Every time I start up the disc, it resets as if I had just placed it into the player and I have to go through all the front matter again. It is irritating because if the blu ray player is on pause and shuts down for lack of activity, it resets the disc and we have to start over.Aside from that little problem, this is one great series, solving a new case each episode, and yet having an on going story in the background. All of the performers are top notch and the stories are all over the map, presenting a new look each story at some form of crime (white color or otherwise). The performances and story excellence carry forward into the following seasons and we are looking forward to the release of the fourth season.",Problem remembering on my blu-ray player,1369440000,"05 25, 2013",3,0
"Be warned: some folks sense of humor can be maudlin.  And, as anyone can tell humor, humor is indeed a difficult concept.  It's certainly one that doesn't always translate (or transmit) well from person to person: what one person finds funny, another finds depressing.  Such is life, and such is the case with STRUCK BY LIGHTNING, GLEE's Chris Colfer's debut project.  Colfer wrote and headlined the picture, and, while I've no problems whatsoever with his acting chops, methinks his script could've used a bit more maturity in order to graduate from cljazz.(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)Here, let me spoil it for you: high school senior Carson Phillips (played by Colfer) is dead.  In case you missed it in the title, he's the one who's been struck by lightning.Now, before you get all high and mighty on me, let me remind you that (A) my second paragraph already spelled out the fact that there would be spoilers and (B) if you're at all interested in this film, then you'll know only a few minutes in much the same: Phillips is dead, and he's narrating his story for the audience in flashback because   as a precocious and world weary spirit at his ripe young age   he has lessons he feels need to be imparted to you, the viewer.See what I did there?  I did exactly what Colfer does with the `moral to his story': he delivers the impact right outta the gate, and then he spends 84 minutes proselytizing about how life ain't fair, how high school sucks, how parents are incompetent, and how you'd better live a life of dreams before it's too late.  And I did it in only a handful of paragraphs.  Now, I've save you 84 minutes you can use for actually achieving some of your life's goals.  You can thank me later.That's what I mean about `humor.'  What works in STRUCK are the niceties   the little things   the quirks of young relationships; the stereotypical talking heads that populate a young person's life (especially the school guidance counselor who's more interested in securing a complimentary, free juice cup than she is concerned about your future); and the like.  Colfer hasn't quite experienced a full life, and, unfortunately, his script revolves around the very basic observations of a relatively young man.  That isn't a bad thing; it's just limiting.  That's why STRUCK is also populated by bad or tragically flawed adults that take the shape of a wryly comic but still abusive mother (has Allison Janney skills for anything else?), a dismissive father (Dermot Mulroney), and a school receptionist who's possibly part pedophile.There are plenty of other television stars packed in here   to the gills!   including Christina Hendricks, Sarah Hyland, and Angela Kinsey.  To Colfer's credit, he does give everyone a good moment or two, which gives the picture a nice touch.  Unfortunately, the fully advertised premise of the film   that Carson is intent on extorting his fellow high schoolers in order to get what he wants   doesn't begin until halfway through the run time, and, as a result, STRUCK feels like it was struck by lightning all a little too late.An impressive first attempt, but I'll be expecting better the next time out.STRUCK BY LIGHTNING is produced by Permut Presentations, Camellia Entertainment, Evil Media Empire, and Inphenate.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As for the technical specifications, the film is extremely well made with crisp images, fairly predictable cinematography, and excellent sound work.  As for the special features, there are a few, including a behind the scene short, an interview with Colfer and director Brian Dannelly, bloopers (17 minutes worth!), and a few deleted scenes.  It's a nice package   all of them are worth a look   so everyone involved should be commended.RECOMMENDED.  STRUCK BY LIGHTNING is a far cry from the zeitgeist works of John Hughes.  Hughes near definitive take on being adolescent in such films as PRETTY IN PINK, SIXTEEN CANDLES, and THE BREAKFAST CLUB appear to be fairly safely mounted on their respective pedestals if Colfer's work is any indication; and that's actually quite sad.  Much of Colfer's script is winning   he admirably captures the sensibilities of the small town boy with the big city dreams and fairly consistently tweaks the basic high school archetypes (prom queen, cheerleader, athletes, druggies, nerds, etc.); the problem is   as most Hollywood creations do   he's also intent on smothering all of the good under the typical Tinseltown indictments of middle America (mom's a closeted substance abuser, dad's a deadbeat loser, principals don't give two squirts about students, etc.) the way a good Progressive Liberal does.  Nice try, son, but maybe you should stick to singing.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD copy of STRUCK BY LIGHTNING by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Battle of the TV Stars Can't Quite Find A Story To Tell,1369267200,"05 23, 2013",3,0
"This whole series is like a writer's pitch session that gotten out of control and produced without any editing.

"I've often said that one of the benefits of DVDs is that we now have the opportunity to view and entire season of a series we found interesting all at once. Perhaps you missed an episode or two, maybe you missed the beginning and came in after others discussed it, but with DVD on hand you can now watch anything start to finish. Binge watching has become a phrase that many have begun to use.If you missed the series HELIX on the SyFy network then you missed an interesting and exciting new show. The story takes place in the arctic at a secret research facility. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) has been called and alerted to a possible infectious outbreak at the station. Specifically requested is Dr. Allan Farragut (Billy Campbell). He's been asked to come because the main person infected is his brother, Peter. Along with Allan is his jazzistant Dr. Sarah Jordan and several other specialized team members.Once they arrive at the facility Allan learns that not only was his brother working there, his ex wife Julia is there as well. This adds some dramatic tension to the show as it slowly reveals that Julia had an affair with Peter which led to the break up between her and Allan. But with Peter's life on the line that's set aside as they try to discover just what the actual problem is.This won't be near as easy to do as they think at first. Whereas Peter was supposedly near death as the story opens he suddenly has superior strength and has escaped a secured outbreak type cell through the air ducts over top. Just exactly what it was that was going on in this facility is at the heart of the show as it begins. Eventually it twists a bit into who is involved and eventually it falls into the category of can this be stopped and the world saved.One thing we witness as the story progresses is an attempt to somewhat cash in on the current zombie craze in movies and TV. Those infected with the virus in that's been released suddenly begin to look like the living dead. Fast zombies, not slow ones. But the real fear factor involved in the series is less about those infected and whether or not the entire planet might succumb to this disease. Containment is the answer but will those behind it all want to keep it localized or are they forming plans to weaponize it?  Those answers aren't coming quickly and not fully addressed with this season. It's more about trying to discover just what it is and how it came to be.Many have compared this series to THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN and it's easy to see why. We have a possible outbreak of a deadly virus that mutates or kills those it touches. Scientists are attempting to control that outbreak at all costs but at the same time someone among them may have an ulterior motive when it comes to the virus. It makes for a combination of science fiction and thriller that works well combined this way.There are times the show moves along a bit slowly but when binge watching that's easily placated by being able to advance to the next episode in a short amount of time rather than having to wait a week. The acting is well played by all involved with perhaps the exception of one person who I will kindly not reveal. If you watch you'll know who I'm talking about. In the end what we are presented with here is a solid science fiction story that holds keeps you guessing from moment to moment. It's science fiction that doesn't take you beyond the stars to find and enemy but right here in your own back yard. Well if your back yard was the arctic. In the end you'll find yourself entertained and wondering what will happen next. That's a good sign for any series.",BIOLOGICAL ATTACK!,1405382400,"07 15, 2014",3,0

"Reno 911 at one time was the best thing on TV for live action comedy.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it was quietly cancelled.  Never heard about why either.The show started out as a great spoof of police procedures and personnel; the cops were breaking all procedures and often the law itself on every show.  But, it was funny all the same, as most of us like to see satire about staid institutions like the law or law enforcement.The last season, shown on these disks, was brief, as were all the seasons of Reno 911.  Also, they changed the players, getting rid of the blonde police ""bimbo"" and Garcia, whether due to contractual problems or other reasons.  They added two ""white guys"" who were funny but made the show too ""one dimensional"" and actually dull.

"As a fan of the original Bionic Woman, I am appalled by the liberties taken by the writers in this show. First of all, they have completely altered the story of Jamie Summers, the original Bionic Woman. The story presented in the series is COMPLETELY different. I don't undertand why they didn't just change her name.Second, the acting of Michelle Ryan is not the best. Still, I do think she is doing the best she can with what she has been given. But, she displays no emotion, barely any tears when crying. Her face looked completely emotionless when her fiance died or when she was at his funeral. The show just doesn't deal with her emotions. They have concentrated so much in the action and the lines that they have forgotten an important part of television, facial expressions and body language. The younger sister seems to be the only one displaying an emotional range in the show.The show is not that cohesive. They do not explain certain things. Why was the sister sentenced(?) or prohibited from using computers? The show just doesn't tie in things together.The show has a very nice visual style (hence my rating of 3 stars) and I think it has some potential, but a lot of things have to be fixed. These facilities, very low budget by the way, where she trains have really bad security and look like a basement. They should vamp up these settings and make them more hi tech. The plotlines and the writing should deal more with how Jamie feels about all of this. She took everything so matter of fact (except for the initial screaming after her operation). Someone needs to wake her up and say ""Woman, you are Bionic! React! I would also like to know how she knows all these fighting techniques. Was some computer implanted into her head? I mean, she did not train for that long!In conclusion, the show has a lot of things that need fixing.

Tom failed it five years ago, and if he fails again or refuses to play now, his movie star wife Emma (Kerry Bish&eacute;) will be dead.I said it&#8217;s a thriller, but perhaps you should not take it too seriously. If you think &#8220;Phone Booth&#8221; has an incredible premise, &#8220;Grand Piano&#8221; stretches the film's credibility to the breaking point and well beyond.

After all, why the criminal needs such an elaborate plan?Spanish born director Eugenio Mira seems aware of that. Some may say it&#8217;s all about MacGuffin, a plot device to further the story. Some part of the film is self referential, to be sure, anticipating our reaction to the criminal&#8217;s motives for choosing this particular method.

"This is a not a good film in any sense. But it is a good film within its genre. Its pure violent pulp exploitation with no pretensions and in many respects its the purity of the concept which elevates it to something more than it would otherwise be. Its kind of like the old Sergio Leone westerns or something like the original Beastmaster or Road House or the first Boondock Saints.The film had its start as a phony trailer in an earlier bigger film. The trailer was a funny two minute joke. But they managed to make it work for real as a film.A nameless hobo gets off a train in a new town with dreams of buying a lawnmower to start a business. But the streets are out of control and the hobo is forced to clean up the town on his own. The town is run by a violent goof named ""Drake"" and his two sons...one of whom looks like he stepped out of old Tom Cruise film like Risky Business. The villians are really easy to hate. The hobo is a no nonsense hero.The film is slightly different than the old ""Death Wish"" formula because there is a clear wealth and cljazz subtext to it. Most vigilante films feature middle cljazz or rich victims taking revenge on psychotic criminals. But ""Hobo"" is about a man at the very bottom taking revenge on a corrupt system run by the wealthy and powerful who exist beyond the reach of any law. Going after the ""bumfights"" guy, going after the rich goof (Drake) and going after the idiot sons of the rich goof are all powerful concepts.And like all exploitation films, we get things that just don't make a bit of sense. Two Junior Iron men eventually show up with no particular explaination. But its so goofy, it works.The only thing that I have against it is that its too violent. Its in the nature of explotation, but I think the material was good enough that they could have done without it. An edited version would probably run on cable forever.The acting is 10x better than it has any right to be. Rutger Hauer was perfect for the role and delivers (as usual) a really solid performance in a third rate role. This is not award winning acting, but its a role that some people would sleepwalk through (but he did not).Most homaige films are derivative and so tied to the source material that they can't ever even be as good as what they are swiping.

"According to Jewish beliefs, the Torah, both written and oral, was handed by God to Moses, who in turn wrote it down; preserving it through the ages to this day. But historical facts and research seem to contradict that notion.The majority of Biblical scholars believe that the Torah,the Talmud and TaNaKh were first written during the Hebrews exile to Babylon (following the destruction of the First 'Solomon' Temple by Nebuchadnezar ll around 587 BCE) and completed by the Persian period, two hundred years later.The TaNaKh relates the deeds and miracles of the Prophets from Abraham, Moses, Miriam, Isaiah, Samuel, Ezekiel, Malachi, and Job.  Daniel is not counted in the list of prophets, yet this film relies heavily on his prophecies and dream interpretations. The Book of Daniel is paramount in this production; and so are the hallucigenic prophecies of John the Divine of Patmos (Book of Revelation).The divinations of the alchemist, Michel de Notre Dame (Nostradamus) and more recently of the ""Sleeping Prophet"", the American Edgar Cayce, are dismissed as nonsensical by the authors of this production. Also they do not spent much time on the geography or history of (Tel) Megiddo, an important ancient city on the Via Maris, a major trade route between (often at war) kingdoms of Egypt, Syria, Mesopotamia and Hittite Anatolia. Megiddo was the site of many battles and is mentioned several times in the Old Testament but without any particular prophecy. Its connection with the Apocalypse and the 'end of days' Battle of Armageddon is only found in""Revelation"".The film is mainly a vehicle to peddle the conspiracy theory of the New World Order (NWO) that refers to the emergence of a secular totalitarian one world government supported by Satan and made possible by the evil machinations of the Illuminati, the Masons and especially the Jesuits!

"This may be one of the strangest films I have ever seen. It seems it might make a Lifetime television film, but I am not sure that would work out either.The film starts out at a wedding reception in Phoenix, Arizona. All or most of the guests and the wedding party are from Minneapolis. It seems the bride wanted her wedding in a warm part of the country. Justin Long plays the groom, Scott, one of the few actors I recognized. Jess Weixler plays the bride, Kristin. Early on we find out that Kristin is hooked on Xanax, and Scott cannot afford the wedding nor the honeymoon. 'Lumpy', the best man loaned Scott the money for the wedding et al. After a hairy wedding reception where Lumpy drank everything in sight, made a mess of everything in sight, he is found dead in a field of cacti.  Scott and Kristin find they must bury Lumpy, not honeymoon and off they go.  The rest of the film is quite an interesting look at the world of Minnesota. The most interesting bit of this film is the young girl, Ramsey, played by Addison Timlin, who was a good friend to Lumpy. She is the focus of the film, around which everything else revolves.The other very strange part of this film is the bride's mother. I kept looking at this woman wondering how I knew her. It finally dawned on me this was Shelley Long of the Boston Bar fame 'where everybody knows your name.' She has changed, weight gain, lined face, weird spotted gljazzes,but the voice rang true. The mother is a busybody always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. However, she added some spice to a pretty bland film. Not really sure what the message is from this film, it may be you never really know.Recommended Warily. prisrob 03 10 14","Lumpy, We Hardly Knew You",1394409600,"03 10, 2014",3,0

"Francis Ford Coppola returns to the Horror genre in a minor way with an unusual Gothic fairytale that will leave you TWIXT! Val Kilmer stars as washed up writer Hall Baltimore, who stumbles in to a small town's dark history while visiting on a promotional book tour. With the help of the local sheriff, Baltimore may have finally found the inspiration for his latest novel, but to what lengths is he willing to go in order to uncover the horrifying truth? Ever the stylist, Coppola tries to inject his own work with a series of surreal nightmares care of some shrouded mists and moody black and white. The heavy use of green screen and computerization frequently reminds us that we're watching a movie, however, and never quite achieves the intended effect that has been generously lifted from SIN CITY. The plot, on the other hand, is refreshingly original, and only bears a minor resemblance to John Carpenter's IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS. Coppla delivers a twisted tale of vampires and murder that has been cleverly intertwined with the works of Edgar Allan Poe, who even makes an appearance in the film (as played by Ben Chaplin). Val Kilmer puts forth a worthy performance as the failing writer, who keeps us engaged with his playful curiosity. Unfortunately, though, TWIXT suffers from the same dilemma as its lead character, and that is in finding its ending. After investing in the town and each of its many mysteries, the sudden ending feels rushed and incomplete. On the other hand, David Lynch would be very proud.

"Although this movie appeared at various international film festivals in 2010, it didn't show up in America until the spring of 2011.  Twenty somethings Joanna (Keira Knightley) and Michael (Sam Worthington) have been married for a couple years but have known each other ""since college.""  By all accounts they are happy but when they attend a cocktail party sponsored by Michael's boss (Anson Mount), Joanna learns that Michael has been working with a new employee (Eva Mendes).  She is sophisticated and beautiful and Michael never mentioned her.After a fight that night, Michael leaves on a business trip with his jazzociate Andy (Daniel Eric Gold) and yep, Laura (Mendes).  At this point, we're not sure if Joanna should be worried as Michael appears to be honest with his wife.  After Michael leaves, Joanna goes down the block from her cool Manhattan apartment to get some coffee and runs into an old flame from Paris (Guillaume Canet).  Wow, what a coincidence!  He invites her out to dinner with another couple.  She primps and purrs but we're not sure if she's on the prowl or just wants a little flirtatious attention.One of the best characters in this movie is one of the friends played by Griffin Dunne.  He gives Joanna and Alex (Canet) the third degree but does it in such a playful, inventive way it doesn't seem overly intrusive or personal.  From here director writer Mjazzy Tadjedin goes back and forth in scenes between the 2 couples and the will they or won't they conflict.  When asked by Laura, as they paddle about a hotel swimming pool in their underwear, as to whether Michael is happy with his marriage, he responds, ""You can be happy and still be tempted.""  Great line.Without giving away too much, I've always wondered which is worse in terms of marriage fidelity.  To do everything emotionally romantic both physically and mentally except engage in an actual sex act and remain technically faithful or have meaningless sex.  For the most part, Ms. Tadjedin keeps things in balance but I suspect this film will have more appeal to the fairer sex.As far as the Blu ray quality, it is a 1080p in a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  It looks great.  Much is shot at night and in a dark indoor setting, so your display's black levels will be tested.  Watch in a dark room if you can.  The DTS HD MA 5.1 sound is also clear and concise but this movie is a talkie, so much won't be happening in the surrounds save the beautiful soundtrack.",3 1/2 stars for a couples drama with beautiful people,1331337600,"03 10, 2012",3,0
"The main reason I rented this was because of Lauren Graham. I have been a fan since following her through all the seasons of The Gilmore Girls, a show that is close to my heart, mainly due to Graham's brilliant performance. Sadly, her movie roles thus far have been rather lackluster, partly because of the secondary roles she has been playing, as in ""Evan Almighty"" and ""Flash of Genius"". In ""Answer Man"", Graham gets to shine a bit more, but I still felt her character deserved more exposure.""Answer Man"" reminds me of ""As Good As It Gets"", only it never quite gets a chance to achieve the brilliance of the latter. Like Jack Nicholson's OCD character, Jeff Daniels plays a quirky and eccentric character. He portrays Arlen Faber, an author whose one book ""Me and God"" created a sensation and became a bestseller, cornering 10% of the ""God"" market. Yet 20 years later, Arlen feels he has not really learned anything nor gained any great insights, so he shuts himself away in his Philadelphia house downtown, living a reclusive life, shunning all his fan mail & interviews, much to the chagrin of his literary agent. Feeling frustrated with all the self help books that fail to lift his spirits nor grant him any useful perspectives on life, Arlen carts the books away to a used bookstore run by a recovering young alcoholic Kris (Lou Taylor Pucci in a wonderfully nuanced performance), only to be refused (as Kris doesn't have any money to buy Arlen's books). To cut a long story short   Arlen hurts his back and seeks help at a chiropractor's which is owned and operated by single mom Elizabeth (Lauren Graham). The pair start to bond but the relationship is complicated by Arlen's eccentricities and inability to reach out to people who need him and Liz's own personal problems.Meanwhile Kris the recovering alcoholic begins to show up at Arlen's home seeking advice in return for taking some of Arlen's books off his hands.The various story arcs do intersect quite well, but the characters lack sufficient development   so Arlen is seeking answers...but why exactly has he allowed 20 years to pjazz by, and his whole romance with Graham almost seems contrived at times. Graham's personal problems are alluded to but never fully explored, and her interactions with her seven year old son seem unbearably awkward and even a tad fake at times. Pucci's character was the most likable in this movie, in that he elicits the viewer's sympathy and makes one want to root for him in his battle against the bottle, yet even his role seems to lack true depth.""Answer Man"" is interesting and engaged my attention, but it is also quite forgettable. I would certainly recommend it as a rental especially for those who like Lauren Graham, Jeff Daniels, and Lou Taylor Pucci, but it doesn't compare to some real gems like ""As Good As It Gets"".","3.5* - not quite ""As Good As It Gets"" but a pleasant diversion",1259539200,"11 30, 2009",3,0

A lot of the comedy that is attempted doesn't hold much thought, and most of the jokes are rather low brow for a show claiming the status of political satire. In the end I could go either way on this. Despite all the failings of this show, John Goodman is really funny, however, that doesn't necessarily excuse bad writing.

First, they replaced the oldest daughter with a different actress, who seams too old and far less believable in the roll.  Then they jumped her son's age by maybe three years and again used a different actor.  Third, they switched actors for the babydaddy, which wasn't so bad, but also made him a much more regular part of the show.

"When I first discovered director Neil Marshall, I was an instant fan.  In the horror genre, he did some solid work with the satisfying werewolf tale ""Dog Soldiers"" and the sublimely staged ""The Descent"" (which I know has its detractors, but for me was one of the most entertaining films of its year).  The ""Mad Max"" retread ""Doomsday"" was an inevitable disappointment  but didn't dispel the notion that, at least, Marshall had a visual flair.  I was intrigued to see him wander into ""Gladiator"" type territory with ""Centurion"" because the man can stage one heck of a battle.  While the film, which is certainly better than ""Doomsday,"" has a lot going for it  sadly, it ends up missing the mark.  My guy reaction as I turned to my friend at the end was ""Man, I wanted to like that much more than I did!""I was genuinely and actively rooting for ""Centurion"" to be more wholly satisfying  so I guess that's a positive comment in and of itself.  First off, the film looks absolutely incredible.  The sweeping countryside and mountainous terrain as the camera pans across is breathtaking.  The battle sequences are alive and bloody  not as dreary as some recent higher profile epics.  The film sounds fantastic with a pulsing orchestration that fits the film beautifully.  But the film's greatest jazzet is its star Michael Fjazzbender.  A sensation in the art house favorite ""Hunger,"" Fjazzbender claims leading man status with ease.  His grounded physicality and intelligence shine through  at times, you think that he's smarter than the material he's been dealt.The film covers the period of A.D. 117 when Roman troops were engaged in a struggle and trying to advance upon the the Picts in the Scottish highlands.  The Picts employed guerilla tactics to hold the Romans off for 20 years.  I won't, but could, debate historical accuracy in the film, but it is clearly meant to be an adventure yarn and not a historical treatise.  However, the film seems to want us to identify with the Romans and brand the Picts as the villains when all they wanted to do was defend their land from being conquered.  Not so bad in my book.  My main issues with the film is that sometimes the screenplay can be conveniently silly.  Several times the Picts don't finish off the stragglers after the epic battle by choice (""oh, just let him bleed""). Their guerilla camp is invaded by not one, but about 6, Romans soldiers in a rescue attempt  not very alert for guerillas!  And a tracker who could trail soldiers for hundreds of wilderness miles couldn't find them in a one room cabin!  These are but a few examples that had me scratching my head.I won't even discuss the unnecessary twist ending or the tacked on romance, I'll just say that ""Centurion"" ended up losing some of my good will.  I'd probably still recommend the film as light entertainment, especially if you put your brain on hold, but I wanted it to be great!  But look for Fjazzbender elsewhere  he's going to be big (I hope)!  KGHarris 08 10",Technically Impressive Epic That Sometimes Fails The Logic Test,1282694400,"08 25, 2010",3,0

The first manned space mission to move further than our moon is on its way to the Jupiter moon Europa because there is evidence of water there and, hence, the possibility of life. The mission reaches Europa but technical problems and an unseen force throw a monkey into the wrench.This is supposed to be 'found footage' film but the multiple camera angles and adroit editing throw that down the tubes pretty early on. This reads like a regular movie. The idea is good and they do their darndest to get the technical jargon right and make it believable. The viewer does get the a good sense of being there with the crew. The problem is that it is a bit on the dull side. Two of the high tension points come later in the film and both lack a certain immediacy. The technical glitch should have been more intense, while the unseen force is too vague. It makes its presence known but there are few clues the crew can jazzemble to figure out what they're dealing with.The acting is all spot on. The crew interact with each other in a way you figure a  crew of professionals, spending some four years confined with one another, would act. I suppose that's another point. There are few ups and downs in the pitch of the script. Even during the tense points, all remain pretty even tempered.This is a very watchable film and those involved worked hard to keep this from being a cheap shot.

"Just about the time that I thought just about every possible variant on the TV cop detective crime solving show had been explored by the creative geniuses who provide our nightly broadcast television ration of pap, piddle and trivia  whoa   here came a show that tickled our Sherlock Holmesian forensic knowledge fancy.  Whoever would have thought that poking around with microscopes and spectrum analyzers and picking up little bits of fluff at a Los Vegas crime scene with a set of tweezers could be interesting? But yes, it was and has continued to be for going on eight seasons now and has given rise to a couple of variants set in New York and Miami. All three of the CSI iterations offer a distinct challenge to a viewer who possesses a decent ration of curiosity about puzzles and mysteries but a very, very low gross out threshold. CSI season 7 mercifully let up a little on the really gross visualizations and focused a little more on the puzzles. Nothing I watched this season sent me gagging from the room, so either they let up or I have gotten a little more used to maggoty corpses.Three of the special features in this collection focus specifically on episodes which made season 7 stand a little apart. The first is  a `making of'  ""Built to Kill"" a two part episode set backstage at the astonishing Cirque d Soliel, another covers  the definitive stunt casting of all time;  Roger Daltry playing five different guest parts in ""Living Legend"".  And a third extra feature focused on the hunt for the ""miniature"" killer, which continued intermittently all though the season. I found the ""Miniature Murders"" feature to be especially fascinating, as I had built many inch to a foot scale model interiors and buildings. Having a series of perfectly replicated half inch to a foot murder scenes showing up within hours of a real, full sized murder offered a puzzle to Grissom and his crew that lasted all season. Very obviously, it would have taken an artisan of miniatures days and weeks to build such a detailed replica, and the feature made it very clear what a challenge it was, even with the resources available to a television studio.

"WARNING: As a conscientious reviewer, I always add a warning to my reviews when there's clearly a campaign to down vote anything critical. Shame on the voters who do this instead of considering an opinion, and shame on Amazon for expecting me to take my precious time to write a good review only to allow this type of shilling activity with the votes.GHOST MINE ~ general review which I'm putting under this particular episode, seasons 1 (2012) & 2 (2013) is yet another paranormal TV show I watch in order to relax and perhaps obtain a laugh or two. I chanced upon it while I was enjoying the obviously phony shenanigans of DEEP SOUTH PARANORMAL (see my review:Dead On The Bayouwhich is the only episode I was able to review).There is an important preface I think I should add. While the wife and I enjoy paranormal shows as popcorn entertainment and to get a few laughs, we're under no illusions as to their reality. In other words, we know these shows are all 100% fake (though I admit I'm a sucker for PSYCHIC KIDS). They hire actors for these shows, rarely any genuine non actors. We see the bad acting in every episode; we often recognize the actors as being from other shows.Here it must be obvious the show deals with a haunted mine. This program appears to be influenced by the cynical personality who 'co hosts' the show, paranormal investigator Patrick Doyle. While stiff as a board with about as much personality, Patrick is a fascinating creature. He is well known for his internet presence as a skeptic and harsh critic of paranormal shows. Recently his internet presence has vanished.So, he and his partner in spook detection, Kristen Lumen (a skittish B movie actress and hypnotherapist not to be confused with actresses Kristin Lehman or Kristen Lowman) both attached themselves to a gold mining crew in Sumpter, Oregon. The mine, up in the Elk Horn Mountains, is called The Crescent, yields pretty pathetic gold, but BOY!!  is it ever haunted.The question with GHOST MINE is not whether the whole thing is fake, but rather: How many of the miners are real miners, and if there are real miners on there, how did they get mixed up in this fakery? As to Patrick Doyle (a former skeptic and hater of paranormal shows) and Kristen Lumen (a k a Kristen Luman, an awful B movie bit player) ... well, show me a paranormal show that DOESN'T have such people. They've got to earn a living!Yet Patrick and Kristen saw fit to attempt to erase their internet presence before going on GHOST MINE. Why do that? To generate publicity? You can't hardly erase your entire net presence, and Kristen is easy to find on the Internet Movie Database while Patrick has left huge footprints all over the web erasing his old skeptical web videos. Food for thought, readers.One thing I already knew which this show exposes is the horrific treatment of Chinese miners from the mid 19th century. There is an episode from season 2 (Mjazzacre at Hell's Canyon) in which Patrick and Kristen travel up a river where several dozen Chinese miners were slaughtered.That is the 'spook hook': it has to be those poor Chinese miners haunting the area. I watch this show mainly for the miners and their work. The show has an obnoxious soap opera tactic: you're left hanging at the end of each show, basically forcing you to wait a week just to discover what the hell happened. Without spoiling, I can reveal that it does resolve itself  pretty shabbily but dramatically  at the end of season 2 which just aired (I think the week of November 18, 2013).While I enjoy and even learn from watching the miners, I get bored as stiff as Patrick Doyle's lack of personality from watching the investigations. Patrick somehow keeps up his robotic lack of personality while Kristen unashamedly screeches at any little noise. It is pointless to name and describe the mining crew, which I suppose is just another mining crew. However, if they were real miners, I somehow doubt they'd accept a paycheck to be put into THIS kind of chum bucket.My wife and I have spotted (besides the lugubrious and annoying Kristen) at least three actors we have seen in other paranormal TV shows. However, when I think of the way pioneers in true adventure expidition documentaries, like Marlin Perkins and Jacques Cousteau, also faked some of their material, well ... there's got to be some fakery, it's TV.At least Perkins and Cousteau were doing real work and bringing us real footage. I warn my readership to avoid wasting money on GHOST MINE. Watch it for free on cable and decide for yourselves. What the heck, one day Patrick might actually show some emotion or at least some life behind those shifty eyes  and Kristen might just finally learn how to act!What is occurring with these shows is sad. These shows are being put out there with the claim they are ""reality""  in other words, DOCUMENTARIES. If an advertised documentary is not a documentary, then it is a fraud. Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did, but they always admitted it; they were not trying to deceive their audiences.The true problem is we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only, which signals that it is a faked show. That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside  has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle? Or is it that everyone wants to forget! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo's exposure.GHOST MINE has its strong points, and I have confirmed these by closely studying fan reactions on the internet. It seems the main catch that makes GHOST MINE unique and very popular is that it is essentially a soap opera. We know it is fake, but that's not always totally obvious  and that deceives people. Even so, we know how much we like it, and people described how they got hooked on the show.In other words, the people who put this together were raising the bar for these kinds of shows. Yet they also threw in with the other pathetic fraudsters who claim their shows are 100% real. I am a fan ofPsychic Kids: Children of the Paranormalbecause at least the children on that show seem genuine. Notice I wrote ""seem genuine"".I'm the first person to admire and applaud innovation  I even established a new branch of anthropology, called ""cinemanthropology"", to study tv movie entertainment and its impact on human culture. What I deplore is the dishonesty, the fraudulent tactic, of pjazzing off such work as journalistic documentary work.Mine is not difficult logic: fraud is fraud, it's still illegal as far as I understand it, it cheapens ruins what little integrity television has left, and (perhaps least of all) it insults everyone. As far as I can tell, GHOST MINE has never had any disclaimer nor have they made an effort to present one after the fact. Don't you think all of that places GHOST MINE and all the other paranormal shows in a kind of unacceptable jeopardy?","This TV trickery has some actual good ideas, but by all means pay Amazon to see something you can watch for free on cable",1383868800,"11 8, 2013",3,0
"When the series first started the Characters were great and the plot was really good. After the Bar owners death it kinda went down hill.

"This was an interesting show.  I chose this because I love Gold Rush and had heard of another Alaska Gold show.  Wow, there is definetly a difference in the two programs.  I gave this program  3 stars because at times I found myself really angry with the people and it was making my life miserable.  If you enjoy watching a dumb  _ _ _ screaming at the people that are trying to help you, then you'd like it.  This program shows several different groups of people using a &#34;diving&#34; method of a what I'd call a &#34;duck taped&#34; piece of wood or metal &#34;1 2 put together&#34; crap boat.  They dive down into the Bering Sea and use a powerful hose to suck up dirt, rocks and gold.  I am impressed however with all the gold that they bring up versus the TV show Gold Rush.  Some of these guys are getting amounts of gold in a DAY'S work, compared to the amount of all the gold that's found in ONE Season on Gold Rush.  These are definetly desperate people that don't have any quams about trying to &#34;get rich quick.&#34; This show films several groups of people; a father and son team, that are the only ones that actually have one of the nicest boats. they have an actual excavator on the boat to dig for gold and run it through their sluice boxes.  This team seems to get the most gold, but with all their equipment they have, they apparently have a ton of debt to pay off first.  Then you have this idiot guy who can not get along with anyone.  At the end of the show, the man that fronted the boat and equipment for this guy ends up FINALLY firing him and they actually get into a fight on the last show.  The others are a young man and women, the women of which doesn't know much about diving and freaks out every time, obviously not getting much work done.  And you find out that this other &#34;excentric&#34; guy that works only when he wants to, is this girls father. Yikes, some crazy people.  All in all, the good and the bad keep you wanting to watch it to see how much gold these people can get.  But at the same time if you can laugh off all the fighting and bleeped out (every other) words without getting frustrated and wanting to reach through the TV to strangle some of these people, then this is the show for you!

"Another of the History Channel's increasing roster of infotainment programs, ""America's Book of Secrets"" is one that is decidedly hit or miss.  Playing up speculation, myth, and even scandal, the show aims to be somewhat provocative but, more often the not, comes across as a bit silly.  I mean, really, there is an episode about the Playboy Mansion!  I certainly don't have anything against Hef and the girls, but the episode seems ill fitting at best and completely overblown at worst.  And for a show that promises secrets, many of the episodes offer very little new material (especially if you have a pre existing interest in and knowledge of the topic).  Instead of straightforward profiles, in most cases the show attempts to sensationalize its subjects.  So we've got myth and speculation, conspiracy theories, and factual specifics all wrapped up in a docuseries that is overflowing with self importance.  If you watch History Channel offerings with frequency, you'll know what I mean.  Even the most mundane declarations are stated in such an overheated way!  It can be off putting to new viewers, but it's something that has provided much amusement in my life.I'm not trying to discourage anyone from sampling ""America's Book of Secrets"" as it might appeal to those that love the National Treasure films or Dan Brown books or Brad Meltzer's Decoded.  I'm just trying to set appropriate expectations for new viewers of History fare.  The program is fun enough, but it works much better as entertainment (to my mind) than as a source of real information.DVD Specifics:  The set features the ten episodes of Season One plus the Bonus Special that launched the entire enterprise (let's just call it eleven episodes for the sake of ease) spread over 3 discs.  Each show clocks in at around 47 minutes so you're getting roughly 8.5 hours of material including the added bonus show.  The DVD has English and Spanish subtitle options.Episodes:(1) The White House, (2) Free Masons, (3) Fort Knox, (4) Area 51, (5) The Playboy Mansion, (6) Presidential Transports, (7) The FBI, (8) West Point, (9) Black Ops, and (10) The Pentagon.Bonus Episode: The MonumentsIf you are completely unfamiliar with the History series format, I might suggest sampling an episode (they repeat with frequency) before making the full investment.  My guess, this will either really appeal to you or it will really not.  While I enjoyed some of the episodes more than others, the series never really qualified as must see destination television for me.

"As MST3k is sort of show within a show within a movie format, I like to review the sections of the episode before giving it a grade.The movie: Actually the movie is a very well made '50's horror movie.  This is a rare MST3k movie where the suspenseful moments create a sense of dread. The acting is great and Forrest Tucker makes an excellent leading man.  If this movie was on late at night, I could see myself watching it   and enjoying it.Segments: Hit or miss. The last few with the 'bots are funny.Riffs: The riffs are funny but there are not a lot of them. I guess at this point I should point out that this is the first episode shown coast to coast.  The movie is great and the segments aren't too bad but you can really see the growing pains with the riffing.  If (like me) you started watching MST3k in the later years, the riffing is painfully lacking.Overall: Not a bad episdoe. Great movie but the lack of riffs hurts.  Obviously this is required viewing for MST3k fans but I would suggest that other people should start someplace else.Other: As mentioned, this was the first episode broadcasted nation wide! MST3k was still a work in process during Season I and it really shows with a slow riffing pace. Later fans (like me) will also be thrown by this and by the bot voices.***NOTE:  I originally posted this review on Netflix.",Great horror movie offset by first episode growing pains,1312243200,"08 2, 2011",3,0

"This is an unconventional historical documentary. It combines narration, re creation and commentary by any number of people including large numbers of high profile people in business. It tells the history of a complicated era (the industral revolution in post civil war America) from the perspective of those who led it. It makes for compelling viewing in that its always presenting things from an understandable individual point of view. But at a price.While the program is extremely watchable, its often playing fast and loose with history. Sometimes its only telling part of a story. An example is the struggle over the Erie railroad. While it leaves the impression that Jay Gould cleanly beat Vanderbilt, the actual story is a whole lot more mixed. The business relationship between Carnegie and Frick is told somewhat from a self serving Carnegie point of view. They go even so far as to hold Frick personally, directly and exclusively responsible for the Johnstown flood. As for Carnegie, the flood is presented as a moment of complete moral transformation leading to the construction of Carnegie Hall. While doting on Carnegie Hall, they fail to even realize that at about the same time Rockefeller was creating the much more ambitious project of the University of Chicago.There is a certain danger in presenting these stories mostly from the point of view of the winners of the era. It edges toward boosterism (and that is perhaps being too kind).There are some commentators I could have done without.

I've read the books this series is based upon, I work with ""squints"" and I thought the writing was spot on, especially the cultural conflict between the scientists and the ordinary joe, i.e., Booth. The original seasons creatively worked through those conflicts and demonstrated how a team can be formed from this kind of diversity.  However, this season has become a characture of that original season.  The characters who had grown are regressing.  Bones is becoming every negative quality that can occur with an over inflated ego and it is not pleasant to watch.

"Whenever another television adaptation of a Stephen King novel comes around, I always feel a little wary. Some of his supernatural offerings seem better suited left to the imagination as opposed to getting a literal screen treatment. That's not to say that there haven't been good interpretations. There have. But there have been just as many failures as successes. If anyone should have a sense of King, it is director Mick Garris who collaborated on previous TV efforts include ""The Stand"" and the much maligned ""The Shining"" miniseries. For me, ""Bag of Bones"" falls squarely in the middle ground of King's television presentations. It has been simplified and changed in ways that purists and or fans of the novel may not appreciate. But for those unfamiliar with the story, it has its share of pleasures as well. For those expecting big scares, however, the pacing of this two part miniseries may be a little off putting. I would describe this as a melancholy murder mystery enhanced by supernatural elements as opposed to any kind of horror show.Not surprisingly, King sticks close to the topics he knows. The protagonist in ""Bag of Bones"" is (once again) a popular writer, played by Pierce Brosnan, who is pushed to the brink of sanity in picturesque Maine. Reeling from a personal tragedy and trying to push through writer's block, Brosnan settles into his family's lakefront country estate. The town is populated by a typical array of eccentrics including a plucky single mother (Melissa George) and an evil town bigwig (TV stalwart William Schallert). It seems that this quaint little berg has seen its share of unpleasantness with a series of murderous drownings through the years. Brosnan starts communing with spirits in the afterlife, and the central mystery seems to have something to do with a blues singer named Sara Tidwell (Anika Noni Rose) of a bygone era. Past and present meet as Brosnan seeks to establish a connection and put a long standing mystery to rest.The leisurely pace allows the viewer to really get to know Brosnan, and he gives a solid lived in performance. The cast also has Jason Priestly, Matt Frewer, and Annabeth Gish (perhaps the most underrated actress working), but none of them has anything to do before all but disappearing. George is likable enough, but the teleplay doesn't really establish a relationship between her and Brosnan before forcing them together. Schallert is menacing fun and his female companion is a hoot. Noni Rose gets a couple of welcome musical numbers, but isn't developed with much depth. Everything is so straightforward and uncomplicated in this adaptation, it is never very hard to envision where the screenplay is taking you. And when you finally get there, it is so rushed and rather unconvincing.It's fair to say that this adaptation of ""Bag of Bones"" lacks the subtleties and shadings of the novel  but that's probably to be expected. If you aren't anticipating big thrills or an exact replication of the book's plot, I might still recommend this for Brosnan's performance. Without commercials, this clocks in at just over three hours. I, personally, liked this slow build (although someone who watched with me declared it a snooze fest). I just wished that when we got to the conclusion, it had offered up something of a surprise. Still, it was enjoyable enough. However, it is not a particularly memorable endeavor when you think about all of the King adaptations that have been produced through the years (would they and could they all be made by Frant Darabont for the big screen!).

When there have been blackouts or 911 in NYC or earthquakes in California, people don't go wacko in a day, so that was stupid. People downtown, mostly they just turn around, and start walking home.

Cops are trained NEVER to do that. The cop puts down her gun and the criminal with a gun can shoot the hostage, the cop and everyone else, in this case, 5 or 6 other people. Stupid. And later the female cops gives her gun to thugs with guns. Stupid and uncoplike behavior. Maybe just to show that women shouldn't have guns or be cops? Sexism?

"I was looking forward to a PLL spinoff when I heard about it. Now that it's here I'm not sure how I feel about it.While PLL has always pushed the border of being realistic, it's always been careful to never go beyond the realms of realism or into the supernatural, even if the latest Halloween episode questionably pushed the envelope. Even if it's been a bit unlikely or slightly outlandish I've been glad that the writers have stuck to these contraints   for me it's made it interesting in wondering how they'd explain what happened. Ravenswood however has a very supernatural element to it, and I'm not sure I like that it has done this, being part of the same PLL world. After a few episodes it's hard to explain most things in the show without accounting for the supernatural unless you jazzume all the characters are crazy. I hope that the writers keep PLLs in the world of non supernatural, regardless of what happens in Ravenswood.On its own merits, I think the casting is not bad. I like Caleb as a character, so I hope he is able to carry a leading role. The initial strory themes introduced in the PLL special regarding the tombstones is interesting, although I don't feel sold about the storylines about[SPOILERS]Miranda being a ghost and kids dying after soldiers returning curse.[ END OF SPOILERS]I would really like Ravenswood to be good.

"[SOME SPOILERS INCLUDED]Halle Berry plays an astronaut, Molly Woods, who returns to earth after a long solo mission in space. Her scientist husband John, played by Goran Visnjic, awaits her at home, along with their little boy, who we quickly discover is a robot. Thus we embark on the beginning of several seemingly unconnected threads, which include outer space, supernatural happenings and the creation of an A.I.The problem is that it's all so clunky. For example, I'll paraphrase the dialogue at the investor meeting where John Woods asks for continued funding for his A.I. project. This is world changing stuff, and it's a meeting with the equivalent of Silicon Valley's top investors. Lots of brain power and big bucks in the room.Female investor in audience: Have you thought what would happen if it all goes wrong? You going to, um, terminate it?John Woods: You monster! Baby killer!Investor: MY child has a soul.John: You MONSTER!I've paraphrased, but that's more or less the gist of it. Really, inventor? You haven't had this debate many times over with all sorts of critics? You're SHOCKED? And when asking for a huge investment, you throw a fit of histrionics?And the ""no soul"" thing thrown out there like that by the potential investor. Could you be any more cliche? You came looking to invest and only now this occurred to you, like you haven't seen it and read it in every science fiction book and film ever made about the pitfalls of A.I.? Hello, to be an investor in Huge Big Buck Scientific World Changing event, don't you think you should know a LOT about the subject matter? It's not enough to just throw on some business woman clothes.Then you have the Japanese ultra rich guy who apparently controls the world and is Up To No Good. Not only does he look Japanese and has a Japanese name, but to make sure we get it that he is Japanese, they threw in a cherry tree in blossom behind him, and had him pour tea in a faux Japanese tea ceremony. After pouring the tea he immediately abandoned the ceremony thing and sat on the table drinking like you would any hot drink. It was in your face and oh so clunky and oh so ridiculous. A subtle writer who didn't want to shove things in your face would have shown him simply sitting at a normal desk without the stupid tree in the background and drinking a cappuccino. Or tea. Or anything.Just two examples of the clunkiness.

"My son watched a few of these with me, and on the first one got put off by the whole &#34;dandy&#34; approach to look, in particular the mustache.  There are many mustache conspiracy theories here and he was all over at least 5   6 of them.BUT, if you look past the primping, the mustache and personal oddities that Agatha put on this guy, you'll find that he's a fairly likeable type who is written to care about the people involved in his life and the victims lives.The stories....  Well, back in the day I imagine they were ground breaking, today, it's like well....  well, still entertaining at least.Some tropes are overused, people dressing up as other people, that sort of thing, still and all the scriptification of these was overall decent and enjoyable.Now on to the oddness, some of  the characters basically vanish over the course of the series, I did a bit of research and seems like that's the way Agatha had written them, disappointing because I liked the supporting cast in the early series.  (Captain Hastings, Miss Lemon (sp?))Couple that with some real oddity on streaming these things.A couple of seasons, in the middle aren't free, I think one is completely missing, and one season in the middle of 3 paid seasons was free.  No rhyme or reason that I could detect.Couple that with the prices on the ones you'd have to pay for being ridonculously expensive and, No, I haven't seen them all.Still and all, for some decent, well plotted mysteries, done in the period, with fairly likeable characters, this series is worth the time.Not nearly as nauseating as the Peter Ustinov portrayals.

While the film offers a good dose of chills and Anderson's flair for psychological horror, the end result just feels sadly empty.  Considering the previously mentioned films that Anderson has helmed were quite masterful, Vanishing on 7th Street just doesn't have that same kind of magic going for it.

"This story is a made up one. However there is no doubt that fierce female warriors existed back then. Boudica almost drove the romans out of britain but was defeated , barely defeated that is!  The acting is good here but really this movie is a chase movie in which a group of legionaires try to escape the picts. WHo later became the scots after mixing with the irish scotti people.  The violence is very bloody and realistic but the loss of the legion which here only has three thousand men is far less that the six thousand a legion usually had.  So you get what you get here and good looking chase movie. I didn't like the ending though , because I don't know of any returning soldiers betrayed regardless of losses. That part was not right but the fact remains that this is a decent action flick in many regards. the budget was not that big as  you really don't have that many sets in this feature. But to be fair they did a good job with the pictish village. This is not a terrible movie , it's not great but it's good enough. Historically even 'gladiator' is all wrong, although commodus was one of romes worst emporers he reigned for twelve years! not twelve months. And people love that movie, including me, I wish the filmworld could get it more right in many regards but this is good enough for a watch and you will root for the Romans. yes, they are the heroes in this movie in spite of the fact that they are out for conquest.  And to be fair , once rome was in charge things weren't always totally bad. (years after the initial conquest that is).  So this movie politically upset alot of people!

"We Steal Secrets: The Story of Wikileaks is a mixed bag at best. On the plus side, We Steal Secrets is brilliantly crafted, well filmed and edited, and fast paced and as exciting as a Hollywood thriller. On the negative side, the director clearly had a personal vendetta against Assange by the end, giving too much light to fishy stories of jazzault in Sweden and his melancholy time holed up in various safe houses.I have no idea why Alex Gibney, obviously a fine director, chose such obviously one sided sources. We mostly hear from outcasts like Daniel Domscheit Berg and other ""former"" WikiLeaks supporters, and too much screentime is given to some extremely questionable stories from the woman Assange allegedly sexually jazzaulted. Neither Bradley Manning nor Julian Assange were directly interviewed, which is obviously a huge blow to the film. We Steal Secrets starts out hopeful and mysterious, detailing the huge leaks perpetrated by conflicted soldier Bradley Manning, and the rise of Wikileaks   the triumphant exposures of heinous war crimes, lies, and secrets swept under the rug by various countries and organizations. Wikileaks gave us the truth on the Iraqi War and the War on Terror that no one else would. But the documentary tries to paint it, AND Assange (which I find heavily ironic since We Steal Secrets is against those who targeted Assange in person) as a controlling, paranoid, suspicious bunch of wierdos.Look, I'm NOT saying to paint Assange as a white knight in shining armor. He's a human being, full of faults and shortcomings, doubts and weaknesses. He's also one of the great visionaries of our time: a controversial and engimatic figure that dared to show us the secrets that our governments wouldn't. Along with whistleblowers like Manning and now, Edward Snowden, and organizations such as The Pirate Party and Anonymous, these individuals seek a more transparent, honest, and safer world. Thomas Jefferson said, ""A government afraid of it's people is democracy. A people afraid of their government is a tyranny.""When you look at it that way, WikiLeaks is a fight against tyranny. Freedom of speech, press, movement, and belief are untouchable rights of every human being. We must fight against tyranny alongside them. Long live sites like Wikileaks!In conclusion, We Steal Secrets is fascinating and provocative, but also biased and not as insightful as it might hope.

"Meaning, that it's a three because there can be an argument made for going in either direction with the stars. The trouble is, the fact that it has such a questionable feel doesn't bode well.It has good graphics. Yay. But that will only last a little while. That's short term thinking. Here is where they could have made a four star product had there been better story or voice acting to back it up. Can Stark get any higher pitched?The Cartoon has very limited plot. We're treated to merchandising sales pitches in cartoon form. ""Here's some gear we'll soon have on the shelves, and you kids are going to buy it because the Avengers are on it."" The jet house, the team and the anti avengers. All set ups for marketing. It's like the suits in accounting wrote the script.One great argument for a one star rating is that the characters are not very likable in this version. There is no room for each character's story, and thus as the team comes together they feel two dimensional and presumptuous. It is far less likely for the audience to forgive negative personality traits if we understand how the characters came to their conclusions.It's frustrating how, despite all their powers the Avengers keep getting whooped by the Red Skull and his tool flunky Modok. And yet, despite almost wiping the heroes out one second, Tony waves a magic wand and utterly and completely defeats the enemy, but somehow misses capturing them in the ensuing kerfuffle of petty Avenger whining.Iron Man: Tony keeps saying that it was a unanimous decision to ax the Avengers, but then Hawkeye accuses Tony of breaking them up a second time. Everyone either attributes no leadership skills or way over the top ability and nothing in between. Unfortunately, Tony pulls a boner trying to save Cap where he doesn't really do much, kind of lackluster, throwing blasts around vaguely until, BLAM, suddenly he's got everything all figured out and, hey, perhaps he really DID know Cap was really alive and not disintegrated, but, no, he didn't know, and it wasn't us mistaking unrequited genius for a lack of talent. Stark comes off like a wiener who uses people when he needs them, and then cuts them loose and sends them packing the second they're not needed.Captain America in this version is the most wishy washy, no spine having est, oops I let myself get shot and died est, would have been spanked by the red skull and left for dead had not iron man blundered into the frozen tundra and saved me est, non Avenger est Avenger of all time... except for Falcon, of course.Hawkeye: Not as cool, tongue in cheek as I would imagine.

Can't get a date on a Saturday night? Mjolnir!!! Is there nothing this hammer can't smash? How about a nail, like into wood to fix something. Nope. Asgardians SMASH... Oh, wait. Isn't that the line of...The Hulk: Slightly more intelligent than previous incarnations, but TRYING too much to be like the movie without actually BEING the movie Hulk. Banner MADE the Hulk in the Avenger's movie. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk is the best out of the three Hulk featuring movies, but this show does not even mention that the Hulk HAS an alter ego. He's JUST Hulk. This cartoon has Hulk constantly pulling the unexpected punch or finger flick that made audiences of The Avengers chuckle when Thor went flying in that museum. But this Hulk is also described by his fellow heroes as stinky and foul breathed with no personality other than an intense desire to smash things.Black Widow: Eye candy. She's there to strut in a skin tight leather suit and bend into a pretzel for mid puberty teens. Otherwise, there's nothing this version did that a really fit chauffeur could not have, even the nay saying.Falcon: I know little about this character, but, and I hate to say it, but it feels a bit like a ""token"" to me. He's not the War Machine we've come to know. More like an intern who eked out a salary by being in the right place at the right time. He is NO replacement for Black Panther, who is NO ONE'S token. Black Panther earned his place in the Avengers, and he deserves to be there.In fact, all of these characters get dissed by Iron Man over and over and still hang on his coat tails like he's pjazzing out free puppies and snow cones. Even Widow, who is just self aware enough to hate Tony and herself for dripping maudlin on his nice, shiny robo boots, is compelled to hang on his every command.Um... Is that it? Geeze! Where's Wasp? Ms. Marvel? Antman, or Yellowjacket, or whatever. Come on!One last thought on storyline. The effects here play the vital role in holding this series, but it's not a good casting choice. Bring in a story arc that goes from one end to the other and isn't just a bunch of this guy vs. that guy. Put some thought and heart and effort into the writing and stop worrying about how much to mark up the cheap piece of plastic out of which you'll be making the new Avenger Jet.Justin Bently has a point about not comparing this series to the previous one. Really, this is a whole different animal. There isn't a tie in with the last one like, ""Ok, THAT happened, but now THIS is happening."" It's a reboot, which means that they got to a point where they felt the last series got way off track (presumably) and now they want to completely remake it in keeping with what they've got going on in their current arena. I just can't see how, if it is indeed an attempt to bridge the gap between movies (primarily because they know with all the individual sequels in the works it is going to be a long, long time before the next Avengers installment hits the box office and they need to keep up interest) it is, in my opinion, a feeble attempt. I have seen the Avengers movie a dozen times (more for my kids, really, but I like the movie, too), and this just doesn't have the same personality.

Really? It could have been poor writing, but ""given"" implied a giver. ""Maybe we were given these powers to help people."" Seriously? Or, maybe, since these special powers are supposedly the next evolutionary step in human development, they were'nt 'given' but a natural evolutionary path. Uh,m see what I mean? Must everything revert back to the lowest thinking denominator? Yesm floods because we're 'given' punishment, and disease because were being punished, and wealth becsaue we were GIVEN wealth for a reason. Shoddy writing at best.How about this: If everything evolves with survival as the reason, then maybe evolution has provided powers to further the survival of the species. Simple, huh? Oh, but it's so much better to try and wedge in some sort of religiosity, right?I was starting to warm up to this series too in that there are some substantive points being made about morality, technology, human nature, instinct, etc. But if we're going to go the route of explanation by gods, forget it.Update: Episode, ""Thanatos.""This is my last episode. The writing is simply lazy and unbelievable. So, in this last episode, John teleports Jedikiah into an Ultra safe house with power modules in it, so then John can't use his powers to escape. Really? I mean, are we suppose to believe that this is even a possibility for a group of teleporting humans that have as their main escape teleportation?Are we suppose to believe that of all of the places on earth that John could have teleported,  he chose an Ultra safe house?Are we suppose to believe that the only place they could keep the head of Ultra was in their own safe place? I mean they could have teleportred him to any part of the earth and back 10 times day. You know, ""Hey, they're getting close again.""Are we suppose to believe that the above people haven't gotten caught based on how stupid a move John just made?Actually, it wasn't any sort of intelligent being who made the mistake, for if this were real, no one with even sub par intelligence would have teleported to an Ultra safe house.The real problem is that it's just too bad that writers these days don't have the intellectual horsepower to see the contradictions their own creation; rather, they insult viewer intelligence to a point of disbelief.For ages 6 10 (and 10 is pushing it logically speaking)","Please, no 'god' factor, just for once?",1384732800,"11 18, 2013",3,0

"I liked the pilot of Betas but this still feels like a show in in Beta mode; not quite ready. The pilot was funny, and easily one of the best of the Amazon pilot season. But the two most recent episodes don't quite live up. One of the biggest flaws is the lead character of Trey. He was charming in the pilot but now grating and not a good fit with the rest of the cast. he seems like a pretty boy acctor trying to sounds like a tech insider.The rest of the crew is an okay mix of pleasant goofballs. John Daily is a breakout as Hobbes, the seasoned but slightly nutso pro. He's easily the most seasoned actor of the crew and it shows. Ed Bagley Jr has the right amount of gravitas and menace as the The Merch, the billionaire investor who shows an interest in the gangs app(which sounds really pointless by the way)The real problem with the show is that they keep throwing tech insider references to ad some sort of authenticity to the show. But it has the effect of making everyone seem like a shallow name dropper. By the way if you're going to throw in a Seattle area reference get the pronunciation it's Tuk will a not Tuckwheela, and it's not a high tech party of the Pugetn sound in any case.The show is at a point where it could either way.

I've been giving one star reviews to basically all the &#34;Real Housewives&#34; shows because they are horrible.

For that it looses two stars because when I sat down to see Mob Wives I wanted to learn about &#34;The Mob&#34;.  The best part about the show is how comfortable the wives are with crime.  They don't take the law seriously and they are all quite scary women.

"Solomon Kane stars James Purefoy as a pirate of royal blood, who's soul is darned for hell (literally!) and becomes a self made holy man. Now, one heck of a story could be told about this man, however this is not a character study. Instead this is another CGI over substance wonder, this one coming from Great Briain instead of Hollywood, that's a novelty I suppose.Based on the works of Robert E. HowardConan   The Complete Questthis is another tale of ""witchcraft and sorcery"", this tale begins in 1600 with Solomon working as a privateer for Queen Elizabeth 1 in North Africa, here he meets a demon who tries to take possession of his soul, it's no longer his, but property of the devil. Solomon escapes, or the movie would be a lot shorter. Once back in England he gives up his evil ways, seeks sanctuary at a church and begins a life of peace, intending to live out his days their. I guess that wasn't in god's plan, as one day, the priests boot Solomon out, I think he got until sundown to leave, because he was out of their fast.Solomon's plan seems to be to wonder the Earth, you know like Caine in Kung Fu, first day out he's besieged by a band of robbers who look escapes from one of those horror films about a family of cannibals. He's beaten and robbed, of what I'm not sure, because of his unwillingness to lay his murderer's hands upon anyone anymore.He's saved from death by a puritan family (Alice Krige and the late Pete Postelwait),their daughter Margaret (Rachel Hurd Wood) and son Samuel (Patrick Hurd Wood), who nurse him back to health, befriend him and give him a silly looking quaker costume.It takes nearly forty minutes to get the core of the story which comes after the family is mercilessly butcher by emissaries of the sorcerer Malicah (Jason Flemying), Margaret survives, but is abducted. Now, the sleeping beast Solomon Kane was has been awakened. Malicah, has imprisoned the people of the land, stolen the throne and has his minions turned into scared brutes. Solomon Kane, as it turns it, is the second son in the line to the throne (Howard had some belief hereos had to be of some sort of noble blood), banished years earlier by his father (Max Von Sydow), he may not have expected  a happy homecoming, but not this.Solomon Kane is s good looking production, good actors, costumes, make up, cinematography, locations. It does sufer under the weight of it's terrible dialogue that sounds as if it was lifted directly from Howard's writing, someone actually says ""silence you dogs"" and Solomon states ""I am the only devil here"", I think you get the idea. I suspect that this movie will draw some comparison with last summer's dudJonah Hex, it is better than that, in some ways I was reminded of Bergamsn'sThe Seventh Seal: The Criterion Collection [Blu ray], and not just because of Von Sydow's cameo, and not because this is great art, but certain plot elements and a tiny bit of it's thematic structure. This in itself, I think makes it a more interesting movie.It is well known that the film has, as of yet, to find a distributor in North America, it was released theatrically in England and parts of Europe where it did poorly. It is hard to say, especially in this filmgoing climate if this is theatrical worthy. I know I liked it better than a lot of what is playing at multiplexies, however it does have a syfy channel ready approach to it, some of the CGI is not so great, Solomon Kane was shot on a budget of $45 million, not $250 million like the latest Transformers movie.  Also, today such high exposure stars as Al Pacino, Kate Winslet, Meryl Streep, Emma Thompson, William Hurt, Dustin Hoffman, Nick Nolte find themselves working on HBO, filmmakers like Michael Mann, Todd Philips, Paul Schrader, Curtis Hnasen, and soon, David Mamet have all directed cable movies.

"Who says an indi film can't be a run of the mill soap opera?  That's pretty much what we get here in this brief (85 minutes) look at sexual desires, infidelity and questionable morality.  The best thing director writer Ry Russo Young (""You Won't Miss Me"") has going for her is the cast.John Krasinski stars as Peter, a Hollywood sound technician who is married to Julie (Rosemarie DeWitt), a therapist.  Julie has a teenage daughter (India Ennenga) who has a crush on her step dad's jazzistant (Justin Kirk).  A twenty  something documentarian named Martine (Olivia Thirlby) shows up to get some help with special effects and sound for her film about bugs.Martine is a friend of a friend and once Peter first meets Martine, everybody's hormones kick into high gear.  Like all good soaps we've got the hunky ex hubby (Dylan McDermott) coming around for dinner.  We've got Julie accepting flirtatious advances from a patient.  The daughter has her eyes on the jazzistant and the jazzistant is goo goo for Martine and Martine for Peter.  Whew!While there is at least one scene of a sexual nature, nothing is overly graphic and little skin is ever shown.

"The series started off pretty good.  It was a fresh approach the first ten minutes, but then began the stereotypical misunderstood cop. The supporting cast  was good, except for the  &#34;older&#34; police woman.  She was just too old to be starting out to be a police woman at this stage of life.  She looked old enough to be ready for retirement.  She should have been in her middle to late thirties, but looked well into her forties.  Just a flaw in the casting, but one that was  jarring.  The protagonist, Bosch, appeared to be weak.  He had the appearance of being jaded.  He needs to have more character.. Its an okay series, but one that I probably wouldn't seek out to see, but might watch if there wasn't anything else to watch.  As long as I had a book to read while the series played in the back ground I would watch it.  Bosch just wasn't a character that I cared about. It's not the actors fault.  He's a good supporting actor, but he won't be able to carry the show as long as the script is as poor as it is. There was too much happening in the pilot.

"This is a decent movie, with predictable ending but really outstanding acting and direction!Addison (Eric Bana), his sister Liza (Olivia Wilde) and an accomplice are running away from a casino heist. Suddenly a deer hits the car and following several tumbles, the accomplice is killed on the spot. Addison and Liza get separate and it's everybody on its own until reaching the Canadian borders. Liza meets ex boxer Jay (Charlie Hunnam), who is en route for a Thanksgiving dinner, with his parents (Sissy Spacek and Kris Kristofferson) on a nice Thanksgiving weekend. A very smart female police officer (Kate Mara) who just pjazzed the FBI entrance examination is involved in the whole situation until the predictable ending occurs.  Her very rude incompetent father (Treat Williams) who is also police chief in this small border town treats her really bad repeatedly in front of all the male officers. She doesn't protest and still loves her father.During the entire movie, I was wondering what the purpose of Kate Mara is. Why are we having this subplot where the father mistreats his daughter, who is much smarter than all the yahoos in the squad, in front of everybody?  And why this is happening on Thanksgiving weekend? It could be any day of the year. In addition, there are so many contradictions in Addison's behavior that it is really confusing. For example, he meets a couple in the forest where the husband boyfriend beats his wife girlfriend in front of the daughter. He kills the guy, makes breakfast for the kids, shoots a cop in the face, and on his way out he leaves a pile of money in the purse of the sleeping mother. Huh? Is he a psychopath or a good guy?After the movie ended and still looking for answers, I watched the extras and saw the director Stefan Ruzowitzky, stating that he wanted to make a point in this movie about families and how bad and unrealistic we Americans are.  That's why he chose Thanksgiving, to mock (analyze portray?) the American family and traditions! He is presenting four families: Addison and Liza, Jay and his parents, the police chief and his daughter, and finally the couple in the woods. In all four families the father figure is like an afterthought, a sperm donor and a mean bastard. I know that most directors have daddy problems (even Spielberg until recently) but that's enough!!! Watch the ""Fifth Quarter"", ""The blind side"", or ""Touchback"" among others and then let's talk family.At this point, my rating of the film dropped by one start (from four to three). I now understood why the plot is happening on Thanksgiving and all the talking about family and the flashback of Liza to her childhood and her father.  This is the problem with all Hollywood actors directors pseudointellectuals high school dropouts, that mostly grew up in a dysfunctional family with no father present.  They are trying to impose their minority views on us. Instead of making a good, entertaining, action packed movie they want to insert their perverted out of town opinion about American society and in particular the American family.  The scene towards the end when everybody gives thanks is laughable and is a direct insult to all great families in this country. In addition, Addison is sitting at the table drinking and eating all afternoon with his hand on the shotgun (while two people are free to move at all time, and one has a gun) and not one single time he goes to the bathroom. How does he do it? Is he wearing diapers? I know it is a movie, but let's try to be realistic.Three stars for the acting and the direction. I wish the director would stick to the direction and leave the script alone! Alternatively, he could have inserted more twists to the plot if he wanted the movie to be less predictable. The ""Counterfeiters"" is a great movie! ""Deadfall"", not so much. Want to see movies with messages about families? All right then! Watch ""The Tall Man"", or ""Gone baby gone"".

"&#8220;Lovelace&#8221; is a bio pic of Linda Boreman (played by Amanda Seyfried), or better known as her stage name Linda Lovelace, who starred in a 1972 pornographic film &#8220;Deep Throat.&#8221; Though Linda Lovelace was later involved in anti pornography movement, the film focuses how she met her first husband Chuck Traynor (Peter Sarsgaard), who brought her into the porno industry, and how,she was actually treated by him.This is a fascinating subject matter, but, despite the wonderful performances from Seyfried and Sarsgaard, the film seems a bit superficial, lacking details. Linda&#8217;s relationship with her parents Dorothy (Sharon Stone) and John (Robert Patrick) is not fully explored. People like Gerry Damiano (Hank Azaria) and Hugh Hefner (James Franco) are portrayed in an uninteresting way. They (and other supporting characters like Linda&#8217;s best friend Patsy played by Juno Temple) leave almost no impression on us.&#8220;Lovelace&#8221; employs a familiar narrative device: telling the same story twice, with two different perspectives. Linda&#8217;s seemingly smooth road to the success as the star of &#8220;Deep Throat&#8221; is followed by a grimmer version of the same story, or what really happened between Linda and Chuck. I do not see the point of doing this. Her life itself is full of events, some very disturbing, so why not telling it in a more conventional way?As I said before, brilliant performances from the stars carry the film, but it seems to me that &#8220;Lovelace&#8221; is a missed opportunity for a more insightful observation about this interesting subject matter.",(3.5 STARS) See for the Great Performances of Amanda Seyfried and Peter Sarsgaard,1395446400,"03 22, 2014",3,0

"I didn't know JOHN DIES is based on a book by David Wong.  I saw the trailer and it looked like it might be fun and inventive, so I rented it.  The film has the manic energy of EVIL DEAD in some of its bizarre images and dark humor.  Unfortunately, it loses steam halfway through and the cleverness succumbs to sheer foolishness and a rushed attempt to tie up loose ends.  The end result for us non Wong neophytes is less than satisfying.  I respect those fans who have a deeper understanding of the book and felt the movie falls short of their expectations.  Director Don Coscarella (sp) had the right idea but just didn't follow through.  Cameron Williamson and Rob Mayes are affable as David and John.

"Dollhouse is a difficult show to review. I wanted to give it 4 stars, but it doesn't merrit it, yet. The first 5 episodes are not good. The stories are bland, and the performances given are servicable at best. But once you get to Episode 6 "" Man on the street "" you are given a glimpse at what the show could be. The actors are finally given a script that they can sink their teeth into, and they run with it. It is fast, fun, and engaging. While the rest of the season is unable to maitain that pace Briar Rose, the second to last episode, is proof that something great can be done with this show. Let me clarify, I like this show, it may not sound like it, but I do.Eliza Dushku takes alot of abuse for her role, and the reason for it is the rest of the cast. While Eliza does a fairly good job with a very challenging role, the rest of the cast is great. This is a show worth seeing if for no other reason than being prepared for the second season which is pretty much guaranteed to live up to the potential of the first.

"The problem is that the premise, a group can successfully keep a whole family hostage for this long, is just not real.  I see so many opportunities for the family to reach out and get help.  The doc could have spoken to the secret service senior agent.  Once she knew Duncan's identity   she had all the power she needed.

"This is a night time soap opera on a grand scale. To sum up the plot; every single character is a big time conniving liar with huge problems like alcohol, drugs etc. and they are out to get money from their family, friends or clients with any means possible, even if they have to kill them for it. Another possible title for this show can be ""The last liar standing"" because every episode seems like a race among the characters; who is going to outsmart and manage to ruin the others.There are plenty of totally absurd unbelievable twists and turns, as in all soap operas, where every possible criminal and indecent behavior is piled up in huge doses; infidelity, murder, fraud, drug abuse, greedy schemes, prostitution, impersonation and plenty more.The hook is typical in TV shows of recent years; everyone is good looking and wealthy, the scenes are opulent and the twists are entertaining, so it makes the viewers feel good about the fact that they are better people than these evil, ruthless and degenerate upper cljazz characters.The main character that we are supposed to identify with is Bridget, who is relatively better than the others, but she was an irresponsible drug edict and a prostitute and the show presents her as a totally changed woman as soon as she jazzumed her twin's identity, like a miracle happened to her   absurd, of course.If I critique it as a soap opera then I have to say it's good. But I personally am bothered by the fact that every drama on TV now is a soap opera. It seems like there is nothing to watch now except gritty crime shows and soap operas. The good old shows like ""The Waltons"", ""The Wonder years"" or ""Thirtysomething"" with nice decent people are non existent, and all the dramas now are full of criminals, drug addicts, mean people and thugs who are getting prime time exposure.

"Being the smartest person in the room doesn't always help. It truly hinders when trying to tell a story where you have to make things palatable for the mjazzes trying to entertain while at the same time discussing topics that perhaps the majority of them have no interest in. This becomes the biggest problem with THE OXFORD MURDERS.The movie tells the story of Martin (Elijah Wood), a young man who desperately wants to study philosophy with the predominate author in the field, Arthur Seldom (John Hurt), now at Oxford. The problem is getting to even speak with Seldom let alone have him be mentor for your grad thesis.But Martin has an in by staying at the home of a woman named Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Mjazzey) who once was friends with Seldom and her daughter Beth (Julie Cox). The love hate relationship between the two makes Martin a tad uncomfortable but he gets by, listening to his landlady's stories and trying to know more about Seldom.At a conference where Seldom is discussing his views on philosophy, Martin raises a question which follows with Seldom putting him in his place. Afterwards both turn up at the residence of Mrs. Eagleton, Martin going home and Seldom to pay her a visit after receiving a note instructing him to go there. What they find is the landlady friend murdered.Thus begins a teaming of the two as they attempt to use their own methods of discussing philosophy and the meaning of life to determine who the murderer is. Unfortunately for much of the movie the viewer sympathizes more with the chief detective on the case Inspector Peterson (Jim Carter) than they do the philosophical duo. Listening to their wordplay does little to clarify the situation but instead confused more issues that either do or do not connect with the case at hand.Along the way Martin falls for a young woman he meets on a squash court, Lorna (Leonor Watling). At first explaining his theories and computations to determine strategy for the game, the two meet for a weekly game but eventually become enamored of one another. It isn't until later that Martin discovers that Lorna was once involved with Seldom.Clues to the identity of the murderer continue to pop up, mostly in the form of notes that he leaves behind as he alters from a simple murder to a serial killer. Each note posts a figure that the discussions of philosophy used to determine what the next symbol will be which in turn will lead them to who is doing the deeds and where he will strike next. The problem is that we're watching as two great minds discuss what would apparently be simple things they would understand in an attempt to explain things to us but at the same time explaining things that most of us won't get.So does that make this a bad movie? Not really. To begin with it is extremely well made with fantastic cinematography and acting that truly makes each and every character believable. And the base story itself, the murder that does indeed get solved by the end of the film is one that uses plot twists and skullduggery to make those seeking the truth go this way and that trying to follow each clue. Even the discussions of philosophy can become interesting at times, though they feel out of place when the whole idea of catching a serial killer is in question.Perhaps the movie tries too much, combining these two elements (murder mystery and philosophy) to little effect for either one. A film like MY DINNER WITH ANDRE showed that two people sitting and having a discussion over dinner could make for entertainment. Here it just feels like we have to emotionally detached loners more interested in impressing one another than in actually discovering whodunit.Its not that this movie doesn't entertain at all, but it makes the viewer work far more than one would expect for a murder mystery and not in the form of solving the murder. Instead it makes you consider the thoughts and theories being discussed around the murder and then try to apply them to solving the case much as the pair attempt. At most it is enlightening, at worst a muddled mess.Is it worth a rental? I'd have to say yes. It might not be one to add to your collection though. Perhaps the best things is seeing a murder mystery that relies little on gore and bloodshed and more on trying to locate the killer.

"With a setup like this the viewer knows, within a flip of a coin, how it will end. So it isn't the destination that matters. It's the trip itself.Here's the scoop. Alice and John (Juno Temple and Michael Angarano) don't have two cents to rub together. Worse yet, they rent a small house from a high school acquaintance who is a real jerk. After John loses his job they are involved in an auto accident. Alice spies a teapot in a nearby shop and is compelled to steal it. The teapot coughs up money when either of them experiences pain, so they do all manner of things to one another to cause extreme pain and become rich. The quest for more dough becomes all consuming and begins to ruin their lives. What to do?This is an Okay, enjoyable film but it's played on a lighter note. Michael Angarano is always likable and he's no different here. I don't quite get Juno Temple. She doesn't have a good camera face and she has a whiny voice. So what am I missing? Anyway...they do work well together. Even under their economic woes they are in love and care for one another, so it becomes disheartening to witness the physical and emotional pain they inflict on themselves and one another to get the teapot to cough up more moolah. Then when they realize they can get oodles more money by inflicting pain on others (even as murder is considered) that things get dark. Then there are the side characters. I just don't see Hasidic Jews going around beating people up and shooting them. That kind of killed things for me. And Arnie, the guy from whom they rent the house is written and acted poorly.

"Welcome to the Punch is written and directed by Eran Creevy   if the name isn't familiar to you, you're not alone   this is only his second feature (his first, Shifty, earned him a BAFTA award and a few other nominations).  It features James McAvoy (I'm becoming a big fan of his) and Mark Strong (another great actor   you may recognize him as the villain in Kick Ass).The story at it's core is a cat and mouse game between a detective and the thief that got away by shooting (and crippling) the detective years before.  However, like many British crime flicks, there is much more than meets the eye.In terms of story, it's serviceable, although I do think it has more twists and turns than it ultimately needs, sometimes tying itself into knots.  The characters (mainly the two leads) are interesting and have personalities and vulnerabilities.  This movie really shines through with the visuals though.  It's got that new school 'blue tint' which I'm not a fan of, but there are a lot of beautiful shots to be seen here.  I'd say that Creevy's technical expertise shows more than his penmanship.I still think it's worth a watch, if you're in the mood for a gritty, British thriller.Final Score: 3 5",Welcome To The Punch,1370304000,"06 4, 2013",3,0

"I just finished the Battlestar Galactia series with some mixed feelings about the show and the path it took to tell its story.I enjoyed the first two seasons quite a bit, but the third seasons writing started to faulter and the fourth seemed like they were using different writers altogether.The show attempted to take on some pretty serious issues that can be hot button subjects for some. We hear throughout the series of the gods (human belief) and god ( cylon belief) belief systems and which was right true Vs. the other false god(s) and in season three it really heats up and is one of the major factors for the war. I didn't feel that this show was a good platform to try to rationalize religion, social wealth status  and race issues that have plagued us forever the way shows like MASH was able to effectively address during its run on TV. Yes, its a drama, but its a scifi fantasy drama and it wasn't near as effective nor as convincing as other shows like Mash's superior writing, acting and directing teams talents.The shows writers creat tension for the show by having these constant  riffs between the military and civilian populations that for me made little sense when the entire race was fighting for survival. Not everyone would use weapons, but would provide support for the troops and the population in one form or another. Yes, there would be issues, but everyone (all were soliders) was fighting for their lives and their race. Yet, we would rarely ever see people join the fight as troops or pilots like we saw during WWII and when you think of the stakes involved the shows creators writers really blow this need for unity and patriotism that saved the day back then as well as for their war.I don't know about you, but half way into season two I had had enough of Galus Baltar (James Callis) who did a great job at being the King Antagonist of all time!!! I felt his role turned into some kind of comic book character like the road runner (at least I like the road runner) who never received a scratch no matter what was thrown at him. Baltar would have been killed more times than all the humans and cylon's combined if his character resembled something other than pure fantasy.All the mutinies and drunkeness and disobeying of orders that were in this story would have been the end of the human race in any other show.Look. I'm am in the middle on this show and how I rated it because of all its flaws and its OTT (over the top) stories plotlines and silly characterizations of some of the cast. I liked the first BSG (1978) a little more than this one because of their character portrayals and stories. That said, I really liked this shows special effects and action scenes over the original series and between that and most of the casts acting abilities help to still make this a decent scifi series to sit back and watch.There is a fair amount of cursing and their version of the F&#8230;word (fracking) being used a lot ( you how many service persons like to swear a lot) to keep from being rated for mature audiences. There is several sex love making scenes through ought the series especially Dr. Baltar's character without any exposed breasts.Again, this was a mostly fun to watch series especially the first two seasons with the third and fourth more of a challenge to sit through. 3 stars.Ps.

"When the Lifetime network announced that it was producing a movie called ""House of Versace"" with Gina Gershon playing Donatella, I had to wonder whether they would play it as camp or go for a more serious approach. No offense to the actual Donatella Versace, but she is a bigger than life personality that is ripe for comedic interpretation. Maya Rudolph absolutely nailed the fashion icon is a series of skits for SNL, but I had faith that Gershon could also bring the goods. And in truth, it is for Gershon primarily that the ""House of Versace"" is worth a look. If you think that ninety minutes of Lifetime fare will do justice to the Versace legend, your expectations probably won't be met. But if you just want a casual glimpse into that world and a bare bones biography, this pjazzes the time easily enough. I anticipated a little more insight into some aspect of the Versace legacy, whether it be the business, the fashion, or the family. But the movie's screenplay really skimps on all three. The first part of the movie plays more toward a campy excess while the second half attempts something more serious. Both parts, however, lack much depth of character or history.As the movie opens, Gianni Versace (Enrico Colantoni) has already achieved enormous success with Donatella as the public face of the company and their under appreciated brother Santo (Colm Feore) playing a role behind the scenes in a business capacity. The plot focuses on the sibling dynamic and the movie's best (and oftentimes most amusing) moments come from the interactions between Colantoni and Gershon. Many of these sequences play out in the fashion workroom, but not much is detailed when it comes to the clothes. When tragedy strikes, the family and the public look to Donatella to take the reins of the company. The film, once again, doesn't spend much time on the events leading up to development. This is not a crime drama, so that doesn't become a focus. Instead, in true Lifetime fashion, the rest of the movie deals with a downward spiraling Donatella. Fueled by drink, drugs, and the scrutiny and skepticism of the world at large, she is determined to take over as lead designer even as she alienates those closest to her. While this is a perfectly reasonable story thread, years go by at the drop of a hat. No time is spent on the disintegrating company, only on Donatella as an addict. Will she get it together? Do I even have to answer that? I bet you can guess, and just in time for the credits to roll on her triumph.My main issues with ""House of Versace"" all come from a rather uninspired screenplay. With the wealth of juicy material and the sheer originality of the Versace clan, I was sad to see this develop into just another ""woman in trouble"" picture for Lifetime. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy much of it. I love a boozy Gina Gershon as much as the next person and her performance had me enthralled. I also enjoyed Colantoni, and even Raquel Welch (I haven't seen her in a while, she looks great) does a credible job as the matriarch. But the movie lacks an insider's perspective or insight that would have made it truly memorable. Quite literally, I know NOTHING more about the Versace family after watching this movie than I did before. And I am no expert on Vercace! Still, I've certainly seen worse from Lifetime. This just had so much potential. Again, see it for Gershon. Her Donatella is strangely captivating, I just wished that the screenplay supported her better.

"Warning!  There are some spoilers in this review.In the spring of 2007 it was reported that NBC had asked the producers of THE OFFICE to expand it permanently to a one hour format.  Initially I thought this was a terrible idea, that the show would be irreparably weakened by expanding it to an hour.  Then I saw the Season Three DVDs with the deleted scenes and with so many really great deleted scenes, I though that perhaps it would be possible to expand it to an hour.  Now, however, I'm not so sure.  Especially after this last of the four one hour episodes that start off Season Four.  As a half hour show, THE OFFICE almost always leaves you wanting more.  But as a one hour show, it always seems to go on too long.  Like most of the four episodes starting off this season, this one just felt like it was over before it was over.I'm not saying that it would never be a good idea to have an hour long episode.  The show has had some very good expanded episodes in the past.  But four in a row seems to have stretched the show further than it really wanted to go.  I'm actually looking forward to it going back to shorter episodes next week.This episode revolves largely around two major stories.  First, Michael's increasing money woes created by having Jan live with him without working any herself.  To help make a bit more money he takes a second fulltime job as a telemarketer.  The scenes showing him at his second job are the weakest in the episode and really do feel like padding to make the show go a full hour.  The other major story centers around Pam and Jim deciding to visit Dwight's bed and breakfast.  After three years of teaming together to play tricks on Dwight    and indeed this visit starts off as a trick on Dwight    they realize how deeply he is hurting because of his break up with Angela (caused by his killing her elderly but deeply beloved cat by putting him in her freezer) and make a couple of gestures to try and make him feel better.  For instance, they give his utterly dreadful B&B; a stellar review on the Internet.  I like the symmetry of Pam and Jim not being together for a long period of time during much of which Dwight and Angela had a hidden relationship.  And now that Jim and Pam are together, Angela and Dwight have broken up.I have no doubt that the show will get back on track, but to do so, the network needs to permanently commit to the show being only a half hour each week.",One of the weakest episodes yet of one of my favorite shows,1192838400,"10 20, 2007",3,0
"A group of soldiers enter GP 506, eventually finding a bloody mess and a corpse... and an axe wielding man drenched in blood. Sergeant Major Seong gyu Noh is sent to investigate the events. The Guard Post is a creepy mystery film with a great setting, held back by confusing storytelling.The story is interesting; as a mystery film, it tackles all possibilities from psychopathic to supernatural, and everything in between. There are unexpected twists and turns at every corner to keep you guessing. It all leads up to a tense, well done ending. The setting is great; an isolated guard post with dark, tight corridors. However, the story is negatively affected by the confusing storytelling. The current events are told concurrently with the past through flashbacks; this can work, but, in this case, the editing isn't smooth and tight enough to keep the audience on track; I think there was even a flashback within a flashback at one point. The point is: you may get lost during this film. Another slightly less negative flaw is the inflated runtime; it often feels empty and uneventful because it is too long. The acting is great, the cinematography is amazing, and I also enjoyed the music (some of it gave off an ""Old Boy"" vibe).Overall, The Guard Post is a good mystery film. Although it has great acting, cinematography, and music, the film is ultimately held back by its poor storytelling editing and an inflated runtime. As of 3 11 13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a rental is recommend for fans of the genre.Looking for other similar South Korean films?

"District Attorney, Mitch Brockden (Dominic Cooper), goes out one night to celebrate a big victory, and fearing for the safety of his car, in a bad neighborhood, decides to drive home drunk. On the way, he hits a kills a man, running across the street. Another man, Clinton Davis (Samuel L. Jackson) is charged with the crime and it's Brockden's job to prosecute the man accused of committing his crime. Not wanting to convict an innocent man, Brockden blows the case, but afterwards finds out that the wounds on the man he hit, were not consistent with being hit by a car, and match the wounds of seven unsolved homicide victims. Now Brockden must find out if he mistakenly let a serial killer go free. Reasonable Doubt, unlike many similar films, actually had a unique and original story. Both Dominic Cooper and Samuel L. Jackson were terrific, and the film really could have been the hidden gem of the year, but only got 3.5 stars. The reason is simple, while it was a great story, it was far too predictable to be what it could have been. I really it hate when the Writers jazzume that the audience is too dumb to figure out what's going on. That's what happens here, while the story is tremendous, everything is laid out in such a way, that even a child would know what would happen next. Aside from that, the great story and terrific cast make for an exciting film, that was quite enjoyable, but it was just predictable to a fault.",The Ultimate Movie Review! - (...) - @tss5078,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",3,0

"The main problem with Apartment 143 is not the movie itself, but the fact we have been inundated with a host of hand held ghost stories that are ""real"" found footage with actors. The production by itself is decent, but given the fact we have seen it before will cause one to quickly get bored.Three ghost hunters investigate the bizarre events at the apartment of Alan White (Kai Lennox). Paul (Rick Gonzalez) is the technology guy and the one we have to blame for all the cameras. Ellen (Fiona Glascott) is the secretary and jazzistant but vastly prefers the title ""gate keeper."" The brains of the operation is Dr. Hezler (Michael O'Keefe). Alan has two children: Benjamin (Damian Roman) who is four and Caitlin (Gia Mantegna) who is at that difficult age. Caitlin has a very cold if not hateful relationship with her father, which immediately makes you think we are headed down the ghost incest lane, something that has become too much of a substitution for good writing here of late.The mother Cindy has pjazzed on. They believe she is the haunting spirit. Caitlin blames her father for her death.This production is subject to the same criticism of all found film productions. This one experiments with an idiotic head mounted camera that gives the film a ""fish eye"" view. The writing and acting were acceptable ""B"" grade fair. The scare factor was middle of the road. The main problem with this film is that we didn't get to feel for the characters.

"Despite being a loyal fan of ""The Office"" for many years, the show hit such a rock bottom after the horrific eighth season that I actually considered dropping out entirely.  Luckily, the show producers (and NBC) must have realized the same thing, as the decision to label this the ""Final Season"" did wonders in terms of all around quality.There are three main reasons why this final season made ""The Office"" watchable again (minor spoilers)...1. The departure of Andy Bernard for the first portion of the season.  The show had pretty much completely wrecked that character during that eighth season, so (despite all that the ""Nard Dog"" had brought to the show in previous seasons) his absence was needed just to get away from his terrible character for awhile.2. With Andy out of the picture, the focus shifted again to where it should have been all along...the incredible ensemble cast.  Whereas the eighth season focused WAAAAYYY too much on guest stars and gimmicks, this season gets back to the tried and true formula of just letting the characters play out and watching the hijinx ensue.3. In the past, as evidenced by the Wedding & Baby episodes for instance, whenever the writers of this show have desperately needed a really good string of episodes, they have always come through.  This was again true down the ""stretch run"" of this season, as the final slew of episodes are truly magical once again with the writers being able to ""pull out all the stops"".  The finale could easily be considered one of the best episodes of the entire show for its equal parts drama & comedy (what the show always needed to succeed in the first place).Now, don't get me wrong...this is not the best season of ""The Office"" by any stretch of the imagination.  Without Michael Scott, this show was just never going to be the same again.  However, it was nice that the finale season was able to pull itself up just enough to make me look forward to watching it each week instead of dreading it.Thus, the Ninth (and final) Season of ""The Office"" was able to do just enough to justify the ""goes out on a good note"" tag.  Seeing as how this was on the heels of bottoming out the previous year, it is a testament to all the show creators writers actors who truly cared enough to make the ending of this great show special.",Setting An End Date Pulled Show Up From Rock Bottom,1368748800,"05 17, 2013",3,0

"After a breathtaking, fast paced Season 1, Season 2 has been a little slow getting going and I have not been as excited as I was with Season 1. I hope it picks up. I think perhaps it is the overemphasis on Paige. She is turning into a rather petulant, difficult teen, and I don't find her parts of the stories as compelling. It reminds me of last season on Homeland. We had another teenage daughter there, who was equally petulant and difficult to deal with, and in my opinion both series have been spending too much time on their fussy teenage daughters. I know the parents are worried about the safety of their children, but I would rather see that playing out in perilous situations rather than focusing on Paige's running off on her own, trying to verify the &#34;aunt's&#34; existence.",A little disappointed with Season 2 so far...,1395100800,"03 18, 2014",3,0

"Call me crazy (go ahead, do it), but a town dominated by a bunch of grown men who all dress like bikers and commit crimes is about as credible as a white collar married father of three being a mjazzive pothead well into his forties.  Let's get real.  You might have difficulty getting into this show because most of the people on the show are, how you say, sorely lacking in reedeming qualities.I watched all the episodes as they premiered on FX and found them to be well written and well executed, but I originally tuned in because I'm a Ron Perlman fan.  I've never ridden a motorcycle or broken a beer bottle over anyone's head, but I do enjoy shows that are different.  Katey Sagal and Ron Perlman do a very good job with their characters.To be honest, I had (and have) a hard time caring about the main character, Jax Teller, played by Charlie Hunnam, who seems like a bit of a turkey and hardly the cool biker dude with somewhat of a conscience that he's supposed to be.  His tall friend Opie is way cooler and much more likeable.  And it's frankly hard to buy Jax's off and on again relationship with his old flame, Tara, who happens to have gone off to medical school and returned a doctor, but who still digs that biker guy she used to date!  (Jay Karnes of ""The Shield"" guest starred on a few episodes as an FBI agent who stalked Tara and I suppose he summed her up appropriately: ""Once a biker wh*re, always a biker wh*re!"")  Well, come on, how could she resist such a bad boy as Jax Teller!  I mean, he's like Einstein 'cause he wears the same clothes every day!Despite my misgivings, it's a unique show with an interesting albeit not always believable storyline.

"A thoughtful individual realizes that the claims of politicians and corporations are unworthy of serious consideration.  For example, why has the crime rate fallen in the U.S. over the past couple decades?  I can remember back when Rudy Giuliani first trumpeted his supposed accomplishments as the major of New York City  the fall in the crime attributable to his approach to policing the city.  I jazzumed that any such shift in behavior is probably due to complex forces beyond our control.  The claim of the authors, however, is that the advent of Roe vs. Wade and the availability of abortion on demand allowed women to delay childbearing until they were properly able to take care of their children.  As a result, fewer children were born into families that didn't want them, and fewer unwanted children meant fewer people who grew up to become criminals.

"LIZ AND DICK, as the title suggests, tells the story of the romance between Burton and Taylor, that was kindled during the filming of CLEOPATRA and lasted right up to the Welsh actor's death in 1984.  Perhaps the main attraction of this film lies in looking at the performances.  Lindsay Lohan makes a creditable stab at Liz Taylor, even if she does not really suggest the actor's indefinable star quality.  Grant Bowler bears little or no resemblance to Burton   he simply does not look raddled enough   but he tries his best to capture the lilting Welsh vowels.  His least convincing moments occur when he tries to impersonate Burton playing Hamlet; the way the lines are delivered suggests only a pjazzing understanding with Shakespeare's text.  The film contains one or two jarring moments: no Welsh person would ever pronounce ""Ivor"" as ""Yvor"" when referring to Burton's brother, while the impersonation of Anthony (""Puffin"") Asquith, the director of THE VIP'S (1963) is laughable.  The ending of the film peters out, with very little attention paid to the stars in later life (for example, their farewell tour of PRIVATE LIVES (1983)).

The film utilizes real facts about Chesapeake Bay and isopods as well as actual footage of the creatures which you think are fake.The idea was to draw attention to the problem of the bay because no one watched the Frontline documentary on poisoned waters and even fewer people cared (from director's interview). The problem is that the terror created by isopods didn't come across as terrifying as I found my self concentrating Donohue's tight pants trying to will a button to pop.I enjoyed the realism more in this film than the ""Paranormal"" series. I also liked the idea of bringing a message to the film. Now if we could take the next step and make it entertaining. This could be done with a witty soundtrack and or clever dialouge. Maybe having Trey Parker Matt Stone smoking a joint saying, ""Dudes they're isopods, not Crab People.""Parental Guide: F bombs (spoken and text). No sex or nudity.

"I'm always looking out for a menacing or cerebral Mars film and this film met my needs, although coming up short in at least two major areas. Starting with the negative aspects first, the movie was filmed poorly. I don't mind the shaky camera technique once in a while but this film over used it, and in an amateurish way. I was also frustrated by an often tight camera look that cried out for an ""un zooming.""I watched this non blu ray and the DVD picture quality was hazy and disappointing.  It took something very interesting for me to muddle through these serious drawbacks, and that was the well done high tension and Mars atmosphere. Is it Mars on a grand scale? No, but its effective enough to carry the story.You've probably read the ""zombies on Mars"" reviews and I can't entirely disagree. I just felt these bacteria infected creatures had an original look that aided in keeping me watching. Obviously the actors are almost completely British, and being an American,the dialogue was a bit unclear, but that was also due to mumbling. I used the subtitles and I didn't hate the script.The film is actually strangely compelling while showing its cheap attributes in the filming process which is odd from my perspective. I think the film opened up some potential for higher tech Mars horror sci fi films. There is a demand for it and ""The Last Days On Mars"" explores that opportunity.Oh, what was the movie about? A good old Mars bacteria and a crew that deals with the shear horror of it. Fun and effectively scary stuff even with its shortcomings. The DVD contains some surprisingly in depth behind the scenes extras, especially for a Red Box rental that has of late been removing ( or unable to supply) extras from their discs.",A good Mars flick,1394755200,"03 14, 2014",3,0

"This show has a few things going for it. Piper Perabo (playing the principle character: 'Annie' Walker) is very sexy, and the producers aren't afraid to show her in some sexy clothing and poses that make me... Christopher Gorham (playing 'Augie' Anderson) is also quite sexy (for the ladies) and once again the revealing outfits and workout scenes are abundant. The costumes, locations, sets and props are superb. It's a very stylish show, with high production value. The music (especially the title track by Flint Eastwood) is killer and the overall production value superb.  The problem with this show? The writing; specifically the portrayal of the CIA (and other intelligence agencies). The show routinely shows CIA agents conducting covert ops inside the U.S., targeting U.S. persons for ops, breaking various laws, acting in irresponsible and illegal ways. Their interaction with other intelligence agencies is always competitive, antagonistic and marked by direct competition. The ignorance (or is it disinformation?) regarding U.S. intelligence agencies (do five minutes of research on Google, why don't you?!) is disturbing, insulting, and distracting. The acting ranges from fair to downright abysmal   If Christopher Gorham is supposed to play a blind person why is he constantly dodging furniture, doorways and objects directly in his path? Is the director awake during the shoot? I don't think I'll make it beyond season two. It's fun to watch for a season or two (I saw season one as well), but ultimately this show will run out of steam.","So factually inaccurate that it makes me groan, but Piper Perabo is oh so hot!",1389139200,"01 8, 2014",3,0

"This movie is entertaining if you go in with low expectations.If you follow horror movies you have probably been pretty hyped about this film. This movie is interesting but I don't feel lit lived up to the hype. I feel that many other viewers do, and have, disagreed with this statement.This movie feels original in its presentation and is definitely able to create some creepy scenes. One main thing to know about this movie is that it is a compilation movie. These were popular in the 70's 80's but have definitely fallen away recently. It is great to see this style of movie coming back.The individual clips have a wide range of reviews. There is at least one that is so excellent that I feel it should have its own dedicated movie. Some of the other areas are derivative of other movies, while at least one is just pointless.  I feel that the different clips are varied in length so that some are so short that its hard to really get a lot out of it. These shorts were maid by people who didn't seem to be completely married to the idea that everything involved a V H S and it shows, but that really shouldn't detract from your enjoyment too much.Even though I am only giving this three stars I still feel this movie was worth watching, and it was a fantastic effort overall.

"I was interested in this show because of the material presented in the book ""Blink"", in which microexpressions are used very successfully. However, one should be careful about trying to apply what you see in this show. For example, the episode where a character is focused on because he is unconsciously or subconsciously giving someone the ""finger,"" can lead to all kinds of amateur misapplication, especially for people who do not use that gesture. It's pop science, emphasis on the pop, so just take it with a grain of salt.Also, photos of many celebrities and especially politicians are shown with a certain gesture or expression and described authoratitively as meaning or feeling this or that. This seems to speak more to the writers' prejudices and biases rather than actual facts. So, again, a word of caution. Reading microexpressions is a science which requires years of training and study; do not go off on your friends and coworkers for supposedly lying to you based on what you've seen here.So, all good fun, if you're not overly gullible.","Interesting premise, iffy facts",1251158400,"08 25, 2009",3,0

"The trouble with ghost stories is that they all jazzume that there's some sort of supernatural rule book that spirits and the like have to follow from beyond the grave. These rules change from movie to movie, and audiences are almost never given any glimpse into what they might be. The end result is that viewers think anything can happen, and therein are supposed to lie the movie's chills and thrills. For some, this works. For those who tend to think a lot, it can be distracting as more and more questions pile up in your head.And don't act like this movie doesn't want you to think. Like most ghost stories, THE PACT is essentially a murder mystery with a ghost (or two?) as characters. In this film, an abusive old woman dies and her oldest daughter, a recovering addict, disappears when she goes to the house to settle the estate. Enter the bitter, younger daughter    Nicole    who begins to discover that there is more to the house (and her family) than meets the eye. What follows is a fairly tense, well filmed, decently acted, but ambiguously plotted search for truth that culminates in some truly creepy but head scratching moments.Since most ghost stories become a game of Find Out Who Killed Me (or Find Out Why The Ghost Hates You), the film starts to falter as soon as most of its larger secrets are revealed. To compensate for this (I guess) this movie peppers in quite a few bizarre minor mysteries that do more to confuse than tantalize. This includes the final five minutes of the film [SPOILER ALERT: which not only include a completely unrealistic portrayal of how recently orphaned children behave, but END OF SPOILERS] which also adds a final shot that requires you to fill in a ton of blanks on your own, like a MadLibs that only gives you two words of the whole story. ""The (noun) (verb) (preposition) the (adjective) (noun)."" This includes the title of the film, which the audience is likewise required to make an entire book of guesses about.Decently directed, the movie would've been far more satisfying had it avoided the abundance of red herrings, as well as the loose threads that make me wonder if they were red herrings after all, as well as had our resident ghost played by some clear, definable rules.

"Many of the elements of the iconic setting of ""Psycho"" are here to hook you into the action. The old Gothic look motel on a weedy hill is well re created, with its treacherously steep staircase to the upper floor of bedrooms, and the dusty, moldering Victorian furniture throughout. Freddie Highmore looks like a teen aged Anthony Perkins and captures the volatile combination of quirky charm and dangerous temper that Perkins projected as the adult Norman Bates. But beyond that, this series goes its own way without providing any legitimate insights into what might have been Norman's making. None of the over the top action here rings psychologically true.For one thing, Vera Farminga's character could not have been Norman's mother. Farminga's Mrs. Bates is young and attractive and outwardly focused. She wants to make a go of this motel she's just bought (this time located in Oregon). She has none of the insular, doting, insidiously manipulative quality that we imagine any mother of a Norman must have had. A psychologically more apt media model for any mother of Norman would have been Howard's mother on the old ""Andy Griffith Mayberry"" TV series. (Often hailed as a cljazzic of small town American decency, many of that series' episodes, stripped of their laugh tracks, could actually be seen to have a chillingly dark side.)What's more, the one after the other dilemmas that are supposedly molding Norman's character in this town are improbable and even ludicrous. Everyone in this small town is homicidally antagonistic due to having some terrible secret to protect. So this comes off as ""Twin Peaks"" meets ""Bad Day at Black Rock.""Outside of recreating the old Psycho sets, there is a certain carelessness about the details and the logic of this series. Viewers are tipped off to this slap dash approach when we see the original name of the motel that Mrs. Bates buys. Before she re dubs it in the ghastly, guttering neons of ""Bates Motel""   the place had been named ""The Seafairer."" I think that misspelling of ""seafarer"" was one of the many oversights of this production, rather than an intentional variant of the spelling.It's too bad that a cljazzic film has again been exploited to grab an audience for essentially unrelated material. Nevertheless, once I realized I wasn't going to gain any serious understanding of the cljazzic Norman Bates character here, I was able to go with the flow of this series of implausible cliffhangers and enjoy the roller coaster ride.There aren't many extras on this DVD. There are a few ""deleted scenes"" for some of the episodes. Then there's a panel discussion about the genesis of this idea featuring the series' producers and some of the stars. The conversation here is lame. You can easily skip this bonus feature and just concentrate on the thrill of the surreal dilemmas in the episodes themselves.",Disappointing & Unlikely as a Back-Story for Norman,1382227200,"10 20, 2013",3,0
"Generally I have very little hope for the procedural police genre. Every season they flood the market hoping to become the new NCIS, and every season they all get cancelled.  This one is no exception.This show started out strong. A female lead, Interesting plot, engaging drama, and just the right amount of pretty to fugly ratio in our characters. And then, halfway through the season, what I can only jazzume is the original writers going on permanent vacation, the story and the characters became shallow, uninteresting, and the episodes cheap knock offs from other CSI shows that came before them. Fake, Shallow relationships started popping up with (surprise surprise) the ""good"" son of a mafia boss, (done before, see Hawaii 5 0, CSI, and NCIS for details). And it keeps getting worse. By the end of the season I literally could not stand Carrie, the lead protagonist. I found her abrasive, agressive, and increasingly irritating character intolerable.In the end the show emphasized only 1 thing: If your boss is your ex lover (who you obviously still having feelings for, surprise surprise), and you have any kind of super power (even a lame one like photographic memory), then none of the rules apply to you, and you are the only one who can solve every problem.The ""remembering"" scenes were cool the first 3 times, but the flashback time in every episode was basically boring as h    towards the end of the season.I think the writers realized by the 5th episode that the show wasn't going anywhere so they just gave up and moved on to planning the next crime show that will fail next season.",Fizzled Out,1370390400,"06 5, 2013",3,0

"Poor, poor Christian Slater.  He's gone from being a reliable presence in slacker or rebel style movies to playing bit roles, such as the borderline pedophile police officer in PLAYBACK.  I don't know what's sadder: the fact that he's sunk so low or he's given second billing in the advertising when, realistically, he's barely in the picture?  Meh.  Maybe I'm overanalyzing the situation.  I guess it's nothing to lose your head about.Julian (played by Johnny Pacar) is working on a school project meant to explore local history.  His choice?  He and his friends are re enacting on video a local family murder mystery.  However, when he learns that there was a survivor of the event   an infant who has curiously gone unreported from the press surrounding the event   he's drawn deeper and deeper into uncovering what may be the real secret, and it may lead him to his very doorstep!For all its portents, PLAYBACK is a harmless flick, a lazy diversion available on video stores shelves nationwide.  Part slasher, part techno thriller lite, part teen flick, it never quite irons out what it can do best, and that's probably tapping into society's collective fear of all things technological.  It probably would've made for a better script   or, at least, one that made more sense than the supernatural way the killer uses video devices to transmits his nefarious desires into the minds of others   but perhaps that wouldn't have been what writer director Michael A. Nickles wanted.  As it is, PLAYBACK feels similar in tone to such quick flicks as FINAL DESTINATION or maybe even any entry in the SCREAM saga, but it lacks the depth   as well as lacks the depth in any performance here   though I'll admit it tries hard.These days, horror films genuinely are a dime a dozen, and it's probably cheaper and easier to go the cheaper and easier way all along.  Why put serious effort in when a modest production   with a respectable budget and respectable players   can deliver any studio a modest payday?  PLAYBACK succeeds modestly as a cautionary tale about youth being co opted by evil forces, and that's the only level is excels on.  That's a disappointment, mostly because the crisp editing works so well.  Everything looks better than the story makes sense.  All of the players do the best they can with what they've been given   while there are no break out performances here, everyone appears comfortable ""phoning it in,"" a curious choice given the fact that the script hints at cell phones proving to be near and dear to the central menace.It's pjazzable fare ... and what better Thespian to have on board than Christian Slater for pjazzable fare?The film is produced by Magnet Releasing, Fontenay Films, Ltd., Bennett Robbins Productions, and Emmett Furla Films.  DVD distribution is being handled by Magnolia Home Entertainment.  It all looks and sounds as good as any other thriller lite.  The disc comes with a brief behind the scenes featurette, a photo gallery, and the film's trailer.RECOMMENDED only for fans of slasher style horror, though they'll probably find very little here to genuinely love.  PLAYBACK isn't a failure; I think it just fails to capture any legitimate narrative.  Everything happens because of some mystical connection from the past fueled through the magic of home video   a device already explored to vastly greater effect in quite a few other movies, not only THE RING or RINGU, depending upon your preference.  When TV was invented, in fact, there was a pocket of civilization that warned us of bad things to come from all of those radio and TV waves buzzing through the air; methinks that maybe they foresaw film duds like PLAYBACK a century earlier.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Magnolia Home Entertainment provided me with a DVD screener of PLAYBACK by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",2 and 1/2 stars: PLAYBACK Has Little `Replay' Quality,1340064000,"06 19, 2012",3,0
"Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, who on his 60th birthday, appears to be the portrait of success in American business, and the perfect husband and father. However, what he portrays on the outside is only a cover up for the dark secrets he holds on the inside. His mansion was a dream come true, but behind the walls are silent echoes that he's in over his head. In desperation, he attempts to sell his trading empire to a big bank, before fraud is revealed. During this process of panic, he struggles to hide his secret from his wife, Susan Sarandan, and his daughter. To add on more stress, he is having an affair with Julie. Just before he unloads his troubled empire, an unexpected bloody event takes place, forcing him to juggle crime with family and business as someone from his past comes back to haunt. The NYPD begins to confirm suspicions, and trouble ignites until it explodes. Michael Bryer goes after Miller full force. Will Miller clean up his act, or run and hide? This is a fast paced drama that relates to economic problems, white collar workers, Wall Street, and crime. The tone is tense, but Performance and Dialogue are lacking. The movie moves too fast as it becomes confusing and disappointing. The ending does not satisfy. Worth seeing? Yes. But, don't expect too much.

"The main premise of this show appears to take the actor with the least screen time or interaction with the star and make them the guilty party.

The main character is likable and the relationship with the nurse is oft times weird and disjointed, but the supporting cast makes up for the obvious flaws and inconsistencies that abound and annoy.

"The early trailers for Monsters are what originally drew my attention to it, even though I knew going into it that it wasn't necessarily what said trailers implied it to be in the vein of Cloverfield.  Still, as impressive as the film winds up being given its miniscule budget, Monsters is still somewhat slightly disappointing in terms of its overall effect.  The story revolves around a pair of travelers (Whitney Able and Scoot McNairy) encountering some dangerous hazards while making a trek back to America coming from Northern Mexico.  These hazards however are of the alien mutant brand, as the film's title implies.  The immigration metaphor is a bit too heavy handed, but it still packs a punch regardless.  The two actors perform admirably enough, even if their characters are cookie cutter to put it mildly.  They pale in comparison to the film's main attraction though, as the monsters themselves are rarely seen, but when they are, they're definitely memorable.  Despite that though, you just can't help but think that Monsters wasn't all that it could have been.  I appreciate what it does and what it attempts to do, but the end result just feels like there's a good amount of wasted potential here too.  All in all, don't go into Monsters expecting an action filled monster flick, but keep an open mind though and give it a chance.",Slightly disappointing,1299456000,"03 7, 2011",3,0

"World's Greatest Dad****Dark, Truthful Outrageous Comedy""World's Greatest Dad""  turned out to be a thougthful story.  It is dark and outrageous, as it sifts through relationships to find what matters.  It is a story of a high school poetry teacher, and aspiring writer,  Lance (Robin Williams) who finds his only son, Kyle ((Daryl Sabara),  dead after a very embarrjazzing and awkward  accident.  His son was rude, gross with fellow students and teachers, and failing in school.  Kyle even insulted his father's girlfriend, Claire (Alexie Gilmore), the young, perky art teacher.  At the scene of Kyle's unexpected death,  Lance is shocked and grief stricken.  He is wracked with pain as he realizes what his son has done.  The scenes are gut wrenching to watch.  He feels the least he can dois to cover up the way Kyle died.  Lance writes a suicide note for his son so he does not have to face embarrjazzment on top of grief.  Because the students at the high school could not believe that Kyle could have committed suicide   Kyle was not afraid of speaking up, he had a strong personality and attitude. Nothing seemed to faze him. Soon a fellow student finds the father's ghost written suicide note on line and it is printed in the local paper.  The note becomes riveting in its depth and hits a chord with students and school personnel.  They could not believe how sensitive Kyle was and how he was misunderstood.  A cult of worshiping Kyle starts up.  Kyle's only friend is not convinced Kyle wrote the note.  He knew him too well.  However,  Lance keeps the momentum going on Kyle's new persona.  He sees a chance to give his failed writing career a boost and writes his son's journal and publishes it.  It becomes a best seller, and Lance gets everything he thought he wanted in life.  But  something does not sit right.  This was not who his son was.  It is who the public wants him to be.The ending is interesting and almost a relief.  Life is what it is.

"Is it becoming the supernatural dating game?I have to admit I was wildly entertained by seasons 1 3A. Season 3B was a little more jumbled and confused and less enjoyable for me. As for this season 4, well the jury is still out.I do like the Mexican hunters, especially the leader. I am still waiting for the season to have more cohesion. Of course it is still very early, but there are only going to have 10 episodes again this year. The storytelling isn't as tight, and despite there being 3 eps already, no Danny. Danny was great. Of course there is also a big hole left by the departure of Allison and Isaac. There is way too much frantic disorganization.Now bringing Kate back is&#8230;well, did they run out of baddie ideas?I liked it when the story was mostly about werewolves. Now it is werewolves, were jaguars, Banshees (at least Lydia is a great character). Werecoyotes. Mercenaries. Time travel. Electricity eating, fox demons who are super skilled at all the martial arts apparently. Now a new kid (Liam) who is a high school freshman, but is still better at lacrosse than anyone else. And there are still new characters to come. There is apparently also a Wendigo storyline.In Ep one the whole temple scene is boring and unnecessary, I wasn't excited at all.. Unfortunately unlike the Braeden of season 3 who I wanted more of, the Braden of this season is flat. I am hugely disappointed in the lack of LGBT characters, too.I am disappointed at all the pairing off. The Kira Scott has no spark, sad to say. I've noted before that there is often a trend to using pairings in a show to get around not having to develop a tight story. What I'm trying to say is unlike the seasons 1 3A, the writing isn't as tight, I don't feel carried along with a great story. I am also very reluctant to say it, but the new characters aren't as compelling as the ones who've been there all along. There is too much fracturing, trying to not only keep the tales of the older characters going, but dumping in new characters that makes it distracting rather than exciting. I find myself asking what is the point?So far Ep 3 is the weakest. I found it too deliberately cutsie, too focused on pairing everyone off.

"""Adore"" (2013 release from Australia; 100 min.; also known as ""Two Mothers"" in certain markets and ""Perfect Mothers"" in yet other markets) brings the story of 2 women, Roz (played by Robin Wright) and Lil (played by Naomi Watts). As the movie opens we see two young girls running on a street towards the beach, and over a clever montage, these girls turn into the latter day Roz and Lil. These women are BFFs, in every sense of the word, much to the annoyance of Roz's husband, who conveniently is offered a job in far away Sydney, leaving Roz and Lil by themselves along with their respective teenage sons, Tom (played by James Frecheville) and Ian (played by Xavier Samuel). And wouldn't you know it: it's not even 20 min. into the movie or Roz is having an affair with Lil's son, and Lil is having an affair with Roz's son! As you can well imagine, a lot of complications arise from this situation. But to give you more of the plot would ruin (such as it may) your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Several comments: first, this movie is directed by French director Anne Fontaine, best known for her previous movie ""Coco Before Chanel"". Second, there are a number of scenes which are simply cringe inducing, in particular when the young guys are being `paraded' (sorry, I can't think of a better term) on the screen. Third, the photography is gorgeous throughout, and of course it helps quite a bit that the outdoor decorum is a slice of heaven somewhere in Australia. Last, but certainly not least: what exactly was Naomi Watts (who executive produced this) thinking when she took on this movie? You know that a movie is in trouble when it's trying to flee from its title not once, but twice, as if to disjazzociate itself from its past (the movie opened as ""Two Mothers"" in Australia, then showed as ""Perfect Mothers"" in Europe, and now shows as ""Adore"" in the US).I saw this movie in April earlier this year during a family visit to Belgium, and the screening I saw this at was not well attended, even though the movie literally had just opened a few days before. Despite my potential misgivings of the main plot point (two mothers in love with each other's son), the reason I went to see this is because Naomi Watts (and to a lesser degree, Robin Wright) starred in the movie, I mean, with those two, ""Adore"" just has to be a good movie, right?

"I should first mention that I do like some indie games, primarily ""Journey"", ""Limbo"", ""Alien Hominid"", and ""Castle Crashers"". Unfortunately, nobody who worked on any of those games is in this documentary.It was hard for me to find a person in this movie with whom I could empathize. The one guy who had redeeming qualities was the developer who was working on ""Super Meat Boy"", and he seemed to be genuinely grateful for the opportunity to pursue his life's pjazzion of creating a game. He was the ONLY person in the movie who was happy at any time... the others were consumed by narcissism, intolerance, insecurity, delusions of paranoia, and delusions of grandeur. They were determined to project an image of being miserable, no matter what happened. At first, they claimed misery due to the lack of opportunities that were made available to their vision. Then, once they were given that (enormous) opportunity by Microsoft (for the Xbox platform), they proceeded to complain about how bad they had it, because the work required was difficult and time consuming (???). I'm dead serious; this is in the documentary  repeatedly.They would also go out of their way to bash the big guys (like Microsoft, who gave them their shot!) for lacking their artistic vision. They would level vehement criticism at the big guys for making games that were popular, and which other gamers like. This level of intolerance was incredibly offensive. Not only are they setting world records for hypocrisy, but they are promoting the ill conceived concept that only those who like the SAME games they like are ""correct"". This is like claiming that there should be only one genre of film or book, or that there should only be one movie director and one book author in the world. The reason that there are different types of games is the same reason why there are different choices in books, movies, cars, clothing, etc... different people like different things! They fail to realize that if all games followed their own patterns and style, they would actually be mainstream, thereby embodying the very thing they claim to loathe.There is one particularly distressing sequence where the developer of ""Fez"" expresses his pjazzionate desire to murder his former business partner (what's wrong with this guy?). Based on his intensity and repetition, it's hard to argue that he's just kidding, especially since they have opposing business interests at this point. He then goes on to scream at some poor convention employee (who has nothing to do with the problem at hand), because his game keeps crashing (because of a bug that he accidentally programmed into it, he admits). Again, I wouldn't have believed it, if it wasn't caught on tape.Most mind boggling of all, these guys go on to complain (profusely) when their games actually get published, make great sales, and receive glowing reviews. Again, I'm not making this up. They're completely determined to project an aura of misery and ""tortured artist"", no matter the opportunities and recognition they receive. Sure, they got great reviews, but ""not for the right reasons"", claims one developer. Again, people aren't robots, sir... everybody is going to interpret a piece of media in a completely unique, subjective manner. To suggest that everybody should only be playing your game, and then perceive it an identical fashion, is so narcissistic, it simply beggars the mind. Another developer, who was whining for sales and exposure previously, proceeds to complain when his game sells thousands of copies on the first day, distressed that he has to ""share"" his game with others (the exact opportunity he was clamoring for, mind you). If it wasn't caught on film, I wouldn't have believed that these reactions could possibly be true.Technically speaking, the documentary is well filmed, though I'm not sure what the filmmaker was going for here.

"As a retired science teacher, and a long time science fiction reader and watcher from the time of Ray Bradbury and Issac Asimov and other cljazz act science fiction writers including H.G. Wells I find some of the sci fi shows today sadly lacking in credibility. A good example is Season 2 Episode 7. The 2nd Mjazz is getting ready to leave for Charleston when their hospital base is attacked by the aliens. Although they sorely need fuel for transport they use up most of the fuel to light up the whole hospital with emergency generators although only a few areas need lighting, and the chance of getting more fuel in doubt. While all of the lights are on the kerosine and battery powered lanterns are left on and burning thus using up those resources. On the way out of the hospital, instead of going to the nearest freeway or at least major paved road, the whole convoy is headed down a one lane dirt road running through what seems to be a primitive camping area. The road appears to be losing it's bottom due to melting snow, and if any of the vehicles get stuck the whole convoy is trapped. These are situations involving lack of common sense and increases the chance of defeat for the Fighting Second Mjazzachusetts. A good example of incredible science, in the science portion of the show, is where the doctor and several others are trapped when a new menace, some sort of creepy crawlies who can chew trough metal are in the process of gaining access to those trapped by gnawing on a metal door. The doctor has one of her aides scurry around to get an oxygen tank. The purpose of the tank is to use it to create a flame thrower to incinerate the little buggers. As a doctor supposedly well versed in chemistry she should know that oxygen supports combustion but will not burn by itself. Using only the oxygen from the tank she creates a flame large enough to do the intended job, when in fact this is a chemical impossibility.

"Better than Season 5, shows some greatness in some of the episodes. Impossible Astronaut & Day of the moon   great, loved River Song in both and I think Mark Sheppard as Canton Delaware III was the best new character since Captain Jack. Stuart Milligon as Richard Nixon was perfect. The Silence are really scary.  The Doctor's Wife is the best episode ever, the ideal of the TARDIS heart and soul being placed in a human being was great and the interaction between the Doctor and human female TARDIS is special. I love the part where the Doctor said's that the TARDIS didn't always take him where he wanted to go, but the human TARDIS said's that she always took him where he needed it to go.A Good MAN Goes To War is excellant, really loved the beginning with Rory on the Cyberman fleet. Loved where the Doctor yells at River ""Where have you been""  The ending where the Doctor learns who River is perfect and knows he has snoged her (as the British say).Let's kill Hitler is a really good episode, I love how it shows where Mel's turns into River. I also love the shout out to Doctor # 10's companions. The interaction between River and the Doctor is amazing, how she goes from trying to kill him to saving his life and how she got her diary.Closing Time was ok, I liked the interaction between the Doctor and the baby was funning and silly and wonderful.But their were some really bad episodes in this season. The worst being  #1 The girl who waited, I mean really Amy   you had to wait 40 years, but Rory waited 2000 years in Pandorica opens and 60 years in the Doctor's Wife, Grow up Amy.#2 Night Terrors#3 & 4 The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People.#5 The God ComplexOverall a good season   worth watching.",Shows some greatness,1359417600,"01 29, 2013",3,0

"In ""Blackthorn"" Sam Shepard plays ""James Blackthorn,"" a mysterious American who, having lived in Bolivia for nearly twenty years, decides to go back to where he came from. While preparing for his return, however, James loses everything   his horse and savings   because of a young Spanish mining engineer Eduardo Apodaca (Eduardo Noriega), who shoots at James ""by mistake.""Set in the early 20th century, the film's story about a tired outlaw drawn into one more (and probably last) adventure is not particularly new, except one part. The outlaw in exile is in fact Robert Leroy Parker, better known as Butch Cjazzidy. While following the story of ""James"" and Eduardo, the film tells us in its intermittent flashback sequences what really happened to Butch Cjazzidy, the Sundance Kid and Etta Place in South America.Spanish director Mateo Gil's film works better as a character study of James Blackthorn than as a western, with a beautiful on location photography and charismatic Sam Shepard, who almost single handedly carries the film. The main story of Eduardo and James, both pursued by a Bolivian industrialist's posse (overlapping the story of the George Roy Hill cljazzic), is fairly entertaining, though it is slow moving and often interrupted by flashbacks that are not really interesting. Not a bad film, not great either.","See for Sam Shepard's Charismatic Performance as ""James Blackthorn""",1368057600,"05 9, 2013",3,0

"I was stunned to see that this film was made by Barry Levinson, the man behind such movies as DINER, RAIN MAN, GOOD MORNING VIETNAM and THE NATURAL. This just didn't seem like the sort of film he would make. Granted it rises above most films like this but still it just felt odd.The movie is a combination of found footage and ecological horror film. The town of Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, has something happening to the water supply. Apparently a combination of fertilizer run off combined with radiation and then being dumped into the bay only to have that water become the source of drinking water for the town results in the mishap. What follows is found footage after the government shuts down the town now a location of little more than dead bodies and pollution.When the movie works it is actually due to the found footage design chosen by Levinson to reveal the story. It's not about select people though there are a few characters that we become enamored of before learning what happens to them. The footage is combinations of home movies, news footage and more that explain what people were going through and how things changed in the town. When added together it makes for a horrifying possible series of events that becomes a tad scary towards the conclusion when the last people to arrive on the docks show up.The weak parts of the film are the belief that this would happen to this extent and that the government could actually cover up the disappearance of an entire town, especially since this is a summer resort where people from across the country would likely show up. If you can suspend your belief on these two items then you might enjoy this nature gets revenge type film. If you think that this is too extreme and left your ecology flag back in the sixties then you might not enjoy it near as much.",NATURE RUN AMUCK,1388448000,"12 31, 2013",3,0
"I love DP, but I thought that this episode illustrated how bad information can lead to unnecessary problems for individuals.  The last segment about magnetic pole shift is a common misperception.  There is currently magnetic pole drift.  This is a fact known especially to pilots who witnessed a recent 10 degree change in runway designations.  This drift is occurring at about 40 miles a year and is West to slightly Southwest.  At the current rate of drift, there is no possibility of the scenario which the last family imagined.  Moreover, even if the unlikely event of a complete sudden magnetic pole shift (the south pole becoming the north pole and vice versa), the axis of the planet would not change.  For the axis to change, the best likely culprit would be a large external force hitting the planet.  In that case, no one anywhere on planet Earth would stand a chance no matter how prepared they were for doomsday.","It is always good to be prepared for the worst, but",1342224000,"07 14, 2012",3,0

"The very dated soundtrack hurts this otherwise OK 70s crime drama. All the suspense scenes are marred by the hokey Dave Grusin score, which sounds like a dippy 1960s TV show. Some of the dialogue is spoken so quickly and mumbled that I found it hard to make out. Some have made a bit much of the Boston accents here. I'm from Mjazzachusetts. Mitchum's accent isn't bad, but it's not fully real. His performance as the small time crook turned rat who fears going back to jail is fine, but it's no Oscar winner. I did like the depiction of early 70s Boston and its suburbs, replete with many of the horrible vintage 60s and 70s Detroit autos of the period. Seeing them again made me shudder. This was based on what was probably George Higgins' best crime novel. I've never read it. Don't expect today's production values with this film.

"With that as my title I have to jazzume that what is depicted in this film must be what an acid trip is like. Oddly enough some have said that yes, this is indeed what it is like. The book on which it is based (which I read and loved) is trippy in itself but bringing that book to screen was not an easy task. Who better to do so then than Don Coscarelli, the man behind the PHANTASM series and BUBBA HO TEPP.The story begins simply with reporter Arnie Blondestone (played by Paul Giamatti) meeting Dave (Chase Williams) in a Chinese restaurant. Dave has set up this meeting to let Arnie in on a secret: there is a world out there that most of us can't see but that holds some truly bizarre secrets and that might be bound and determined to invade our own world. Arnie asks for details and the story behind Dave's claim and Dave fills him in from the beginning.John (Rob Mayes) is Dave's best friend. They live together and do little except bum around, work terrible jobs and go to raves with their friends where John usually performs. At the particular rave they go to on this night, Dave meets an unusual Jamaican who makes Dave feel a bit uneasy. Eventually Dave ends up taking a drug known as Soy Sauce. How weird of an experience does he have? He wakes to get a phone call from John who wonders if he's talking now or in the future and then warns him of the danger he's about to be in.This is when things begin to get weird. And it's not a bad weird but a good one actually. Both John and Dave, having taken the Soy Sauce, can see a different world than the rest of us can. The drug enables them to see into another dimension and reveals the real people that they talk to and meet. Along the way on their adventure they're joined by Amy, a girl Dave's had a semi crush on for some time.Bug monsters, possessed policemen, policemen who aren't really there, thugs with big knives and more are just the more normal things that the duo witness. They also discover a plot to take over the world by creatures from the other dimension that only they can stop. Through it all they seem to jump back and forth in time and dimensions. They seem to be the only ones who can save our world, not a comforting thought when we first meet them. But they do show the courage and pluck to take on the task and probably have just enough chutzpah to get the job done.As I said from the start, this film feels like what I'm told a drug trip feels like. If so please, never slip me anything. But at the same time it offers an entertaining film that's unlike most others offered these days. It's fresh and new and holds your interest from start to finish. Coscarelli proves that he truly can make a low budget film that has high budget quality once again. It would be nice if Hollywood would finally realize this and give him the chance to make his movies with a bigger budget while at the same time staying out of his way so as not to ruin it. Am I the only one ready for PHANTASM 5?I'll admit that this movie might not be for everyone. It is, as stated, a bit unusual. But it's fun and it entertains. Will I watch it again? If so, not right away. It's a film that you need to walk away from for a while and then watch once more. Would I like to see them film the sequel (a follow up book has already been published).

"When Only God Forgives was announced, I was stoked.  Drive was my favorite film of 2011, and the re teaming of Refn and Ryan Gosling...I mean, how could you go wrong?  The original plot was listed as:A Bangkok police lieutenant and a gangster settle their differences in a Thai boxing match.However, that must have changed.  That's only a few minutes of the film.  The actual plot has nothing to do with that.  The synopsis should have read:A drug dealer's mother hunts down the men that killed her son.This film is available in VERY select theaters or on VOD right now at home.  I went the at home route, as it was not playing anywhere near me.So...did I like it?This film is very hard to explain.  It's very avant garde, and very 'old Kubrick'.  It's almost all visual, with little dialogue to support it.  All in all, Ryan Gosling only says about fifteen lines of dialogue.  That being said, the visuals are amazing.  Cliff Martinez does an amazing job creating a very unique look in Thailand...lots of contrasting reds and blues.  The score also stands out as swooning synths back the scenes not set to Karaoke music...and there are a few of those.The characters in this film (aside from the police lieutenant) are all unlikable.  There are various levels of filth, from Gosling's 'impotent watcher' to pedophiles, to sadistic mothers.  The lieutenant does leave an impression as a justice seeking machine, with little conscience.  I cannot say much more about the characters without spoiling things, so I won't.  The plot is very thin.  It's basically a standard revenge story.  The violence is sporadic but fierce.  There's a torture scene in here that is definitely not for the squeamish.The acting is serviceable.  Gosling is withdrawn and blank.  Most of his acting in this movie consists of errant stares.  Kristen Scott Thomas does a pretty good job as a mix of Courtney Love meets Lucille Bluth in a sadistic mother role.  Vithaya Pansringarm is fantastic as Chang.A lot of people are going to hate this film.  Gosling is even more withdrawn than he was in Drive, and Refn is in full on art house mode here.  This is for fans of Drive and even more so, Valhalla Rising.  If you didn't like those, you'll hate Only God Forgives.  Dave Chen from  Film described the film as 'Ryan Gosling walking down red hallways, fingering people'.  Not everyone is going to 'get' this one.I did not hate it.  I also did not like it right away, but the more I thought about it afterwards, the more I did like it.  It left an impression on me.

This series was listed as 'suggested viewing.' Fault to me for not reading why it was suggested. Thirteen episodes later? Possible reasons are an interest in military medicine and forensic pathology. The episodes offer a reasonable account of several cases that I actually remember. The reenactments and the ability to follow the actual thought processes of those involved with both criminal and forensic aspects is well presented. The diagrams and conclusions of experts in multiple fields of criminology is definitely a positive. It certainly doesn't resemble my usual military history documentaries!

"This season was OK, but for me the twists with the sous chefs did not work. First of all the competition among these guys was shown very abbreviated and I just felt like all I cared was about who was going to get immunity for their chef, but nothing else. Also, the obstacles the chef would get from those sous chefs on the bottom bordered on silly. It seems to me that the creators of this show are looking for gimmicks to keep the viewers attention, when in reality they should go back to the basics of what the show is about, good cooking.That is actually what the show did well this season. The group of chefs competing was outstanding, and we got to see some really nice creations. There was also a nice balance between different types of cuisine and techniques. If only they had focused more on the chefs and their ability to produce quality food, this would have been much more interesting than what it was.",Some good some not so much,1382140800,"10 19, 2013",3,0

"I was really looking forward to Hannibal the series but the more shows I saw the more confused I got. The show is very dark both in scene and in story which would be ok if there weren't so many holes I can't seem to figure out. First Will was the killer and then not then Hannibal and then Will is eating at his table again (probably his latest human kill). It's apparent to all that Hannibal is the killer yet nothing is happening. The relationship between Will and Hannibal is confusing at best and I have no idea who the hell some of the females are. Too many characters in the mix; to swiftly glossed over storylines. I watched Friday night and turned it off because now I don't know what the hell is going on and frankly  I don't really care anymore.  I've rented those shows which I missed and watched them over a couple of times but I'm either an idiot or I'm just lost in all the names, the faces, the killings, the who's, the what's and the wherefores.I think I'll skip Hannibal next season much as I thought I'd love it I'm not convinced there are too many things going on, to many killings (did Will really kill Freddie)??) and just too much going on all over the place.I'll stick with the movies those I can understand; they make sense and they don't have a gazillion characters coming out of the woodwork!I love Laurence F. but in this he's a little stupid (the character not him).  I hate the darkness of the  scenes where you can barely see anything.

"This season of SP isn't as solid as many of the others.  There are a few episodes I think are a little weak like ""Medicinal Fried Chicken,"" ""Poor and Stupid,"" ""Insheeption,"" and ""Creme Fraiche.""  But what the season may lack in consistency, it makes up for in WOW moments.  I don't think I've ever been as blown away watching an animated show than I was seeing the uncovering of the truth of Cartman's father on ""201.""  ""Mysterion Rises"" also gave me a ""Of course!  It's so obvious!"" moment.  This season also offers quite a few old school Looney Tunes cartoon references that brought back childhood memories.  Season 14 was good though not as consistently brilliant as past seasons.  I am reducing the score an extra star because of the egregious censoring of ""201""  one of the most exciting SP episodes ever.  What could Kyle and the others at the end possibly be saying to warrant the entire thing being bleeped out?  And the bleeping of every mention of Mohammad is very annoying and is a bit baffling considering his name was not bleeped at all in ""200.""  Why not bleep it on this DVD if it is so dangerous?  Still, I guess we are lucky that this episode is included at all since it is not available online and hasn't been aired on Comedy Central since.Disc 1:""Sexual Healing""  So clever.  Saying what a lot of people think went down in the Tiger Woods's household, but doing it in X Box EA Sports form and then bringing in the sex addiction theme with Ben Roethlisberger, Bill Clinton, Charlie Sheen, etc, is just brilliant.""The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs""  The boys are disappointed by a supposed controversial book jazzigned in school (the one that ""made a guy shoot the king of hippies"" according to Cartman), so they write their own.  Afraid of getting in trouble, they credit the book to Butters who is elevated to genius for his masterpiece in sociopolitical commentary and uncontrolled vomiting.  It's funny how readers interpret the disgusting pjazzages.  Gross.""Medicinal Fried Chicken""  KFCs are being replaced by medicinal cannabis stores.  Randy and his friends purposely get testicular cancer so they can partake.  This episode is overly silly with the men bouncing on their balls like hippity hops.  Meanwhile, Cartman resorts to the black market to get his KFC fix.""You Have 0 Friends""  Despite his resistance, Stan's friends sign him up with a Face Book account and he is deluged with demands from ""friends"".  Stan finds that deleting a FB profile is tougher than he thought.  Meanwhile, the always sympathetic Kyle befriends a lonely boy who has no friends and finds that his own FB stock falls as a result thanks to Eric ""Kramer"" Cartman.""200""  This episode and the sequel blew me away back when they first aired.  In this part, Tom Cruise and all the celebrities defamed in South Park get together and demand to see Mohammad, who is the only person they know susceptible to ridicule, so they can get his goo.  They then get competition from gingers.  In another storyline, Jennifer Lopez (a.k.a. Mitch Conner) gets Mr. Hat to admit to Cartman that there was a cover up pertaining to the identity of his father.  A LOT of past characters show up in these episodes which is a real treat for long time SP fans.Disc 2:""201""  The continuation of ""200"".  I will not give away the ending, but it blew me away when I saw it when it first aired.  I said, ""No Way!"" out loud even though I was watching it by myself.  Brilliant!  Controversy surrounds the ""I learned something today"" speeches at the end as Comedy Central decided to bleep them out.  They are still bleeped out on this DVD.  I thought it was done on purpose when I first saw it, but Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actually angry it was done that way and a text statement from them is included at the beginning of this episode.""Crippled Summer""  A hilarious take off of the ""Intervention"" TV series featuring Towlie"" ""I'm not high! I haven't been high since Wednesday!...Oh, it IS Wednesday.""  Also, a Looney Tunes treatment is given to a camp for handicapped kids where Nathan (the steroid seller in ""Up the Down Steroid"") keeps trying to get revenge on popular Jimmy, but his plans keep backfiring on him thanks to a dopey sidekick.""Poor And Stupid""  Cartman thinks he can't fulfill his dream of being a great NASCAR driver because he is not poor and stupid.  He thus gives away all his money and eats Vagisil to impede his short term memory.""It's A Jersey Thing""  South Park (as well as the eastern half of the country) is being invaded by New Jerseyites.  It gets so bad, they contact al Qaeda for help.  In this episode, viewers find out Sheila Broflovski is from Jersey (big surprise, huh?) and her son Kyle was conceived there, meaning he is struck by the three J's, according to Cartman, Jerseyite, Jewish, Jinger.  Fans of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" and ""Jersey Shore"" will appreciate this episode.""Insheeption""  This is a take off on the TV series ""Hoarders"".  Those shows are often funny anyway in a pathetic way, but I don't think SP took advantage of the possibilities.  A sheep herder?  And the hoarding theme is replaced by the dream memory sequence.  This episode is also taken from the film ""Inception"" (hence the title) and the College Humor parody of ""Inception"" (so much so, it lead to an apology from Parker and Stone).  Stan's mom sums up this episode very well: ""Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool."" On a side note, that bully who torments a young Mr. Mackey looks like the kid in ""Eight Is Enough.""Disc 3:""Coon 2: Hindsight""  The Coon and his super hero friends keep getting overshadowed by Captain Hindsight, ""the hero of the modern age,"" who only tells people what should have been done to prevent disasters after they've happened. When he becomes the hero of the Gulf oil spill, Cartman tries to recruit him by resorting to blackmail.  Meanwhile, BP's continuous drilling causes increasing horrors for the environment and humanity.  The other members of Coon and Friends are fed up with Cartman's violent, overbearing tactics and kick him out of the union.""Mysterion Rises""  In this episode, we find out the identity of Mysterion (if it wasn't known before) and his real power.  When I saw this part I was blown away, ""Of course!  It all makes sense now!""  Cartman joins forces with the evil Cthulhu to get back at his former ""friends.""  Mysterion tries to see if there is a connection between the Cult of Cthulhu and his power.  I like the parody of the Lebron James commercial.  The Cthulhu song is hilarious.""Coon Vs. Coon & Friends""  In this final installment of the three parter, Cartman and Cthulhu banish Cartman's former friends to the Nightmare City of R'lyeh while they wreak havoc to make the world a better place...for Cartman.  Mysterion takes action to stop them but an unsuspected hero may be the one to save the day.  I like Cartman's comic book summary of the story where he pleads with his ""evil"" friends (he thinks he's the good guy, of course) to ""Go with Christ."" Cartman also does a parody of that cartoon where the little kitten kneads and curls up on the back of the bulldog.  I remember that cartoon from my kid days.""Creme Fraiche""  Randy becomes obsessed with cooking shows in a sexual way while his wife Sharon gets out her frustrations using the shake weight.  This episode is hardly believable  I mean cab fare wouldn't be a few coins LOL.","""Just because an idea is overly convoluted and complex doesn't make it cool.""---Sharon Marsh",1307664000,"06 10, 2011",3,0

"When people react to a situation in a way that is neither believable or appropriate we quickly lose sympathy for the characters. This pilot is not terrible however you see a bunch of people playing out cljazzic, and rather stale, caricatures. The acting isn't bad and the production is good although the action sequences seem oddly discordant and fail to flow naturally. Would police really ignore an officer in need of jazzistance? Repeatedly? Would an officer shoot instantly when an unarmed man charges them, yet wait patiently for people carrying shotguns, and with obvious ill intent, to disembark a cramped car? No, she would jazzess the tactical situation and take them down as they try to exit the vehicle. Perhaps I expect too much from a police officer, but clearly her reactions are inconsistent with one another.As others have noted, hanging on to the back of a vehicle is completely nonsensical. It is incredibly hard to hang on to a vehicle in such circumstances and indeed why would you even try? The officer is incredibly vulnerable and hanging on for grim death she can't possibly deploy her weapon without falling off!So now we can guess this is ""supernatural intervention of the apocalyptic kind"". This kind of subject has been beaten to death so I can only hope they've figured out a new twist on the ""judgement day"" metaphor. The question is: do I want to see more? The pilot doesn't do enough to sell me on the story line (whatever it is) and I don't care enough about the characters to be bothered about their fate. However I would be willing to watch a few more episodes to see how it pans out.The program does have its moments, such as the actress using her audition lines to fool a self centered opportunist. I get the feeling the director either isn't vested in the program or is an amateur slightly out of their depth. This is by no means the worst pilot I've seen and indeed there are regular scheduled programs such as The Following which are far more annoying and ridiculous. So maybe it has a chance.

"Whedon, who put this together, put together the bang up job on the Avengers, also put together Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.With Buffy, love the series, but the first season or so was ... meh (okay) ... It was all about the later seasons, where the actors and plot hit it's stride.I'm getting a similar vibe here.  Decent actors for the most part, accents on some of the actors gets annoying.  For whatever reason it seems that accents are obligatory now, not a believer in that.  Put a good actor in, have them read the lines straight up.Their banter isn't up to snuff yet, the inter relationships a bit predictable, everyone and I mean everyone has at least one major secret banging on the door, trying to get out of the closet.Secrets just seem too.... well, densely packed...  They should have handed out SHIELD scorecards.Still it has it's moments, the set devices (particularly the &#34;bus&#34;) are quite nice.Actors good, characters at this point seem a bit one dimensional, the James Bond type guy stoic, can do it all by myself, don't need anyone else.  His saving grace, he has decent martial arts skills and the fight scenes are generally pretty good.The &#34;rebel&#34;, well, decent eye candy, but very annoying at present, if she had a flag, she'd be waving it all the time.The seasoned spy who doesn't want combat and winds up piloting the &#34;bus&#34;, love that actress, but right now playing an extremely subdued personality type.  Not really using her to effect, but I think that will change.Tweedle dee and Tweedle dum, the &#34;Bobsie&#34; (Sp?) twins, beyond annoying... need to come up with a new word for that...  predictable... pendantic... dunno, let me get back on that.Coulson, hero from the Avengers &#34;OH he must never know his secret&#34;, like how he &#34;survived&#34; the Avengers movie after being harpooned and *chuckle* sent to Tahiti?!?Plots....  well, they push the limits sometimes, Can't say a lot here without spoiling the plot for those that haven't seen it yet.I have some faith in Whedon, think it will get better, but also though I've pulled the plug on my TV, I've found a legal source for the episodes where I don't have to pay for them (See Playon, the software product), and doubtless it's available directly off the web site.So, likely will continue to watch, but not continue to pay for this, at this rate a few days   week delay for watching this is fine for me.",Not fully baked yet,1381190400,"10 8, 2013",3,0

"The reviews of this movie were great. I couldn't wait to see it. As it turns out I could have.The comparisons to Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai' are inescapable, and this just isn't as good. In 'Seven Samura1' you have a group of Samurai protecting a farming village from bandits. In this movie you have a group of Samurai who need to jazzjazzinate a demented Shogun to stop Japan from declining into an endless cycle of war. 'Seven Samurai' runs 3 hours and 17 min. (depending on which version you see) and time is taken to allow the viewer to meet the principal characters and set up the story. '13 Assjazzins' runs at 2 hours and 5 min. so you only get to meet a small handful of the guys for whom you are supposed to build up sympathy. They do a decent enough job setting up the story but it's peopled mostly with a faceless group of samurai. And their clothing and hair cuts were so similar it took me way too long to sort them out. The one fellow they take on as a guide and the 13th member, who easily stands in for the Mifune character in 'Seven Samurai', is the only face you could pick out of a crowd.Also, these jazzjazzins are well funded. They literally buy an entire town away from its inhabitants, with gold, to stage the big battle. They aren't the 'down on their luck' samurai from Kurosawa's epic, so you don't get the same sense of desperation.The battle itself is decent enough. Some of the 'tricks' they use to help even the odds (13 against 200) don't ring true. They are too ""now."" The actual sword fighting scenes are good but they're really not more than a lot of hacking. You don't really get to see a difference in the level of skill between the two factions. So why the huge difference in the kill ratio? It's like in a lot of American action movies where the good guys can shoot a fly off an apple at 50 yards and the bad guys can't hit doodly squat.This is not a bad movie by any means. It's very watchable. It's shot and edited well. The sound mixing and editing are good. It has a good look overall. It has a decent enough special effects. (some that are a bit suspect).

"Let me make one thing clear: there is nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. Well, its CGI equivalent, anyway.It seems to do everything right. The animation is stylish without ever taking itself too seriously. It draws many of its styling cues from the hugely successful 80's series, but always in a relatively subtle way. It never merely apes its progenitor, but from the opening titles to the color of April's shirt, it constantly pays homage to that august predecessor. It even knows when to turn squarely in the opposite direction: we get the ""angry"" Raphael from the real original version of the turtles   the Eastman and Laird comic books   rather than the jokester first minted in the ""kiddified"" Archie Comics version, which then went on to become world famous in the first turtles cartoon.So this is a show that's stylish, clever, and certainly light years ahead of the 80's cartoon on any kind of technical level.And yet...For me, this series never quite pops. Something's missing here. Certainly none of the characters have the stand out charisma of the original animated versions of Shredder and Krang. The way those two would bicker like an old married couple; the way that version of the Shredder would groan with such heartfelt outrage at each fresh ignominy visited upon him. An enormous amount of the original show's appeal came directly from that evil duo. Even Bebop and Rocksteady grabbed your attention and brought an out loud laugh to your face in a way that nothing in this latest version does. If I had to put my finger on just one thing as lacking in this latest version, I'd have to say that it's really GOOD bad guys.Like I said in the beginning, there's nothing wrong with this show. It's a perfectly good cartoon. It's just that... Well, whatever ""X Factor"" may be, the 80's version had it, and this one just doesn't. I want it to   I swear I do.

"You know, sometimes I wish that the Blair Witch Project was never made. Why? Well, it seems every other movie you see is using the 'found footage' thing. Thing is, nobody is doing anything new with the idea. Some movies would be better off if they weren't like that. Case in point, Area 407. The story is about two sisters who board a plane on New Years' Eve and start filming themselves and the pjazzengers while they're traveling. After the plane crashes in a government testing reserve, the survivors find themselves being pursued by predators that are part of a top secret government experiment. Taken from their raw footage, AREA 407 explains what happened to them and the other pjazzengers on that fateful night.The story itself is an excellent premise for a movie. The acting was pretty much on par with other movies of this sort. The wounds and gore were very realistic. Heck, even the plane wreckage was realistic. It's when the camera comes into play that killed things off for me. I've seen so many movies of this sort that it ain't even funny anymore.

"When I watched season 7, I noticed that the teamwork and the shining moments of the better chef's appeared to be weakening, and having heard of this season's reputation I wasn't looking forward to it. It did turn out better then expected as I still enjoy the show, but I feel the progress the show made since, the very negative, season 2 was mostly undone.The chef's this season show more incompitent moments then shining ones and most of the better preforming chef's still get into many arguments and the teamwork side was vertually non existent. Also unlike the past four seasons I didn't have firm faith in the top few chef's. They were the better preforming chef's but, mainly because others did worse then them. Had they been on any other season, I would have clearer and better opinions of them but they probubly would've been eliminated a lot earlier. Now the drama aspect of the show is still fun and unlike season 2 this season wasn't negative at all but that is what saves the season, seeing Ramsay yell at people.So ultimatly I'm conflicted, on the one hand this is the worst cast in Hell's Kitchen history along with the one of the worser winners, and yet the fact that the season wasn't negative, is funny and the right person won this time makes it somewhat preferable in comparision to season 2 (where the only good thing is the winner).Do I recommend this to fellow fans?

"The Bob Hope MGM Legends Collection contains seven of the funny man's films, spanning over two decades of Hope's illustrious screen career.  Bob Hope (1903 2003) got his start in vaudeville, and enjoyed a successful career in radio and on the stage, and became a huge star in film and on television.  In the movies, Hope's style was usually characterized by fast talking, witty repartee, and generally being light on his feet.  After teaming with Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour, in The Road To Singapore (1940), the first of the seven ""Road"" pictures, Hope's career elevated to new heights.In chronological order, the films in this collection are They've Got Me Covered (1943), The Princess and the Pirate (1944), Alias Jesse James (1959), The Facts of Life (1960), The Road to Hong Kong (1962), I'll Take Sweden (1965), and Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966).  A quick summary of the films follows:They've Got Me Covered (3.5 stars)Set in Washington D.C. during World War II, Hope plays a newspaper reporter who is on the trail of some Axis agents who are trying to implement a nefarious plan.  Dorothy Lamour co stars.The Princess and the Pirate (3.5 stars)Bob plays an entertainer on a ship bound for America, who gets tangled up with a princess (Virginia Mayo), when the ship is captured by pirates.Alias Jesse James (3 stars)Set in the American West, Hope is an insurance salesman who sells Jesse James (Wendell Corey) a life insurance policy, and then has to try and make sure that no harm comes to the infamous outlaw.The Facts of Life (4 stars)Comedic legend Lucille Ball co stars with Bob in this sensitive and funny drama about marriage, love, and fidelity.  Not to be missed.The Road to Hong Kong (2.5 stars)The final installment in the ""Road"" series finds Hope and partner Bing Crosby involved in an out of this world escapade, as Russians agents send the pair on a rocket trip to the moon.  Joan Collins co stars.I'll Take Sweden (3 stars)Hope is a father worried that his daughter (Tuesday Weld) may marry the wrong guy.  He takes her to Sweden to derail her wedding plans, but once there, both father and daughter find romance heating up.Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number (1966) (3.5 stars)Elke Sommer plays a starlet looking to get away from it all, who gets a misrouted telephone call from a real estate salesman (Hope), which instigates a kooky escapade that threatens to break up two marriages.These seven films illustrate that while Bob Hope's unique comic style evolved through the years, in many respects, it remained essentially the same.  Ranging from Westerns, to swashbuckling tales, to wartime adventures, to the close of the Crosby era, to coming to terms with the beatnik generation, the affable guy with the quick wit, endless quips, and ski slope nose was there to entertain.  As this set has apparently gone out of production, getting a copy may unfortunately be a difficult and expensive proposition.Due to a glitch at Amazon, this set and the film Boy, Did I Get A Wrong Number are linked as being the same product, so this review is listed for both products.","a nice selection, and fine introduction to Bob Hope's movie career...if you can find it",1325980800,"01 8, 2012",3,0

"If you loved a 90 minute film of Paul Walker in a car (&#34;19&#34;) you'll love another short titled Walker film &#34;Hours&#34; were he spends nearly the entire movie inside a hospital, particularly one room. During Hurricane Katrina his wife Abigail (Genesis Rodriguez) goes into labor and gives birth to a premature daughter who is placed on an IV and ventilator. As the hurricane intensifies, the hospital is evacuated until it is just Nolan (Walker) and his daughter and no power...except a hand crank generator. Nolan must turn the hand crank every three minutes or else his daughter will die. The film has some flashbacks to show us what a perfect couple he and his wife were. As the hours take their toll, Nolan fast and furiously attempts to get help, power, food, IVs, etc. in three minute intervals.Paul Walker did an excellent job with what was essentially a one man play. Unfortunately for me, I tend to find these one man movies, even when done well, less than entertaining. The film includes some footage of the storm and CNN news reports. The film is a drama thriller. It is light on the thriller part in order to make the production believable.

"The much bigger budget for Stargate Universe as compared to Stargate Atlantis is easily recognized in the quality of the set and the CG creativity. The main story line shows much promise and originality, the main story line being a group of civilians and military personnel stranded on a several 100,000 year old space cruiser over which they have little control as it speeds through space.The kernel of each episode is cantered on the problems encountered while trying to keep the star cruiser running, but the script writers have taken the linear story style of Stargate Atlantis and set it on its head. About 7 out of the 9 episodes I've watched more or less use a very disruptive story telling style, IMO. Perhaps is is just my taste in film style, but I personally find the sudden and frequent changes in time between the present, the past and sometimes the future very disruptive and distressing to watch and I'm talking 15 to 20 seconds between changes from present to past, to future than back to the present. Thanks to the streaming video I am able to fast forward through these horrible ordeals.Additionally, the script writers have written in sudden changes from reality to fantasy such as memories, flight of imagination and such things which are portrayed in a realistic style and therefore extremely hard to follow, and detracts from he main story development which is surviving on this several 100,000 year old star cruiser.The writers seem to have decided that character development is to be done by cutting from the main activity on the star cruiser using this choppy style. It is very similar to the style used in the TV series ""Lost"" and equally annoying and irrelevant. It is almost as if the writers have to insert this horrible content that IMO adds nothing to the plot except extending and filling out the episodes like they couldn't think of anything else to do.Ultimately, I find myself very often watching in suspense and interest only to be drowned in vanilla cut scenes to personal events in the characters past that does absolutely nothing for the plot or character development that could not have been done in one tenth the time in a more conventional style such as that used on the two previous Stargate series.This TV series has the potential to be a 5 star rating. I gave it 3 and would have given it 2 1 2 if I could have because of the botched up writing of the script.I find this rather tragic as the concept is great and the acting is more than adequate. I hope the writers stop brewing it up and get their script writing together.I recommend this TV series only if you are willing to put up with the 7 out of every ten minutes of crap, IMO, for the three minutes out of ten that are truly great cinema.","IMO, the format of this potentially superb TV series make it an agony to watch . ..",1259020800,"11 24, 2009",3,0

"Cropsey (Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio, 2009)Cropsey is on the surface about a particular urban legend that surrounds an abandoned mental institution in Staten Island, New York, but Zeman continuously hints in the narration that the movie is really about the creation and life cycle of urban legends in general. Had we ever actually gotten that movie, I think Cropsey would have been a much more satisfying thing than it is, though the story they cover  the real life alleged serial killer Andre Rand who lies at the heart of the Cropsey urban legend  is interesting enough to carry the movie.Plot: co directors Zeman and Brancaccio, both of whom grew up on Staten Island, had childhoods saturated in the urban legend of Cropsey, a shadowy, semi legendary figure who supposedly lived in the bowels of the abandoned Willowbrook State School, a horrific mental institution that was the subject of an expose by Geraldo Rivera early in his career. Cropsey, it is said, was responsible for the disappearances of a number of area children over the years. The reality of the situation, at least as the State of New York would have us believe, is that Cropsey was actually Andre Rand, not a former patient there, but a former orderly. It has been proven that Rand did, in fact, live on the grounds of the former Willowbrook for a number of years in makeshift camps. Allegedly, he was also responsible for five of the disappearances attributed to Cropsey that took place between 1972 and 1987. The film, once it starts to focus on Rand, takes us through his arraignment and trial for the kidnapping of Holly Ann Hughes, who disappeared in 1981.For what it is, it's not bad. But what it is and what it purports to be are two different things, and that kept nagging at me as I watched the movie. If you're more interested in true crime documentaries, then this should be right up your alley  but if you buy into Zeman's jazzertions that this movie is a lot more meta than it really is, then you'll probably end up feeling as disappointed as I was. Still, it's worth watching for the more mundane angle. ***","Not what it wants to be, but what's here isn't bad.",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",3,0
"Though melodramatic the Season 2 finale of Mad Men had one of the most concrete and enriching ends. It showed us a side of Peggy we didn't know exists. Mad Men definitely slows down in Season 3 and eventually there are a lot of things that take a completely different turn. For me the star of this season was the character, Pete Campbell. I think he's one of the most interesting actors on the show and he is terrific, he's the sort of slow burner character that grows on all of us and he is funny even when he isn't and is simply being himself. I feel this is where Mad Men shines, it shows such a vast array of characters who actually seem to live in their own theater.Don Draper, the central character, takes quite a few hits in this season and amazingly enough it is like a see saw between him and his wife, Betty. Betty truly finds herself in this season and after many years of marriage decides to venture out. It is amusingly sad to see their relationship disrupt because of the conviction with which Draper carries himself is complete undwindling. Don Draper is right even when he is wrong, his eyes seem to show a complete contrast to the morality of his actions. Would this sort of a person be accepted by other as a friend? Notice he doesn't have any friends except maybe good old Peggy.In Season 3, the women of the show find themselves while the men stands on confused grounds.One of my favourite episodes of the show was the one where the President has just been jazzasinated. The response of people all over the country is one of emergency, alarm and everybody in general is devastated. The show very keenly highlights how there was an absence of the vicarious disease which seems to have taken over America. What I'm trying to say is that the way people are saddened by the President's jazzasination is the true indicator of compjazzion which country men in those days felt. Forgive me and correct if I'm wrong but a similar incident in today's time would raise different reactions from the general lack of attention span...ok I'll stop dwelling on that. It was such an awesome episode.While I liked Season 3, there is something amiss here. Maybe I liked the show but I don't agree with the direction it went. Maybe I didn't like the falling apart.

"Executive produced by Ridley Scott (among nineteen producers in all), ""Welcome to the Punch"" revolves around a London police detective Max Lewinsky (James McAvoy, ""Last King of Scotland"") hunting down a master criminal Jacob Sternwood (Mark Strong, Guy Ritchie directed ""Sherlock Holmes""). When Sternwood flies back home to meet his heavily injured son Ruan (Elyes Gabel), Max, still emotionally traumatized, is given another chance to capture Sternwood with his partner Sarah Hawks (Andrea Riseborough).This is a sophomore work from a British director Eran Creevy (""Shifty""). He effectively uses the blue tinted images of the deserted streets and buildings of London, but despite the stylish photography and slick narrative, the story and characters needs some more details.The leading players deliver fine performances. The film's interesting cast includes Dannielle Brent, Jason Flemyng, Johnny Harris, Daniel Mays, David Morrissey and Peter Mullan. Peter Mullan gives some depth to an otherwise stereotypical role as Sternwood's trusted friend, but not enough, and Jason Flemyng and Daniel Mays are wasted in the roles that are forgettable.Fast paced modern day noir ""Welcome to the Punch"" adds little to the genre. With two capable leads the film starts out well, but loses its momentum in the third act that gets more familiar and predictable. Still, all in all, this is a pretty satisfactory crime thriller with some nice camerawork.","Modern-Day Noir in London: Well-Acted, Slick But Familiar",1368835200,"05 18, 2013",3,0

"After loving Debbie Macomber's Cedar Cove book series, I was excited to learn a TV program had been developed but so far the translation from print to TV has been a disappointment. Andie MacDowell is great in her role as the &#34;town leader&#34; as the only sitting judge but also a member of a respected and loved family in Cedar Cove. However, besides the casting of Andie MacDowell as Olivia the other actors don't live up to my expectations for the characters. I wish there were more well known actress and actors instead it is cast of unknowns who don't have any special chemistry together especially the chemistry the viewers who had read the book series  would expect the who people who live, work and raise their families in the small community of Cedar Cove.  As a Hallmark Channel production, I guess they didn't have the budget for better know actors and it is a real shame because there is so much potential with the material from the Cedar Cove book series. It reminds a bit of  the eccentric town in Gilmore Girls without the chemistry the actors had with each other on Gilmore Girls. As I think of it, many of the Gilmore Girl cast members would be perfect for the Cedar Cove residences. Lauren Graham would have been a great in the role played by Andie MacDowell, an actor like Rob Estes (Melrose Place and The Women's Murder Club) would be great as Jack, Olivia's love interest. I could recast the entire show but I'm trying to be patient and come to know the actors and enjoy the story lines in the mean time.",Somewhat of a disappointment,1378339200,"09 5, 2013",3,0
"Why Stop Now is mostly a comedy that begins on such a promising note before eventually falling apart.  I can't help but feel the writers missed the boat and didn't know how to wrap up the film with a satisfying conclusion.When an expert piano player (played by Jesse Eisenberg) takes his mother to a drug rehabilitation center, it's discovered that his moms urine is unusually clean so... in order to be granted permission into the drug center, she has to come up with a way to get drugs into her system and taint her urine, lol.  That's pretty funny!  So, she gets Jesse involved in a drug obtaining scheme that initially involves wearing a disguise costume and pretending to be a drug addict himself looking for a quick fix, but this quickly turns into an entirely different matter as one offbeat situation after another develops, and the drug dealers discover they're being visited by Jesse for other reasons.However, because Jesse knows the Spanish language, the drug dealers drag Jesse (and his mom) to a restaurant where a secret meeting with *other* drug dealers concerning high priced drugs takes place.  The conversation we see here between Jesse and the drug dealers (the African American and the Spanish guy sitting at the table) is the best moment of writing in the entire movie for me.  Loved this scene!  Everything seems so promising up to this point until... well, eventually the storyline fizzles out.  The strength of this storyline clearly should have been on the drug dealers because the oddball and unrealistic relationship they develop with Jesse and his mother as they travel around town is easily the high point of the storytelling, however it all goes to waste shortly after this scene.Jesse has a crush on a girl at school and through an unusual reenactment involving the Civil War, they get to know each other better with each segment.  This is honestly a pretty boring aspect of the film, and I see no reason why it should have even been included.  Also Jesse's younger sister has a puppet addiction, so much so that the teacher asks Jesse to make her stop and communicate with her cljazzmates normally.  This is another ""Why is this even part of the story?"" moment.  Only when the drug dealers and the little girl have a little argument over the puppet does it reach a brief moment of being enticing.At least Jesse's mom is believable in her drug addiction role, and Jesse's emotions when dropping her off at the drug rehab center are EXCELLENT!  Really strong, forceful and believable emotions revealing the frustration he's feeling that his mom won't quit taking drugs.  She's obviously reached a point of addiction that she needs to end it as soon as possible by any means necessary.  Still, there should have been more involvement with the drug dealers, Jesse and his mom.  The moments where Jesse's playing the piano during an audition and revealing his amazing talents are pretty good, but nothing great (except the one where he's bleeding  you'll see what I mean when (if) you watch Why Stop Now).  Another memorable part comes when Jesse calls his mom's sister pretentious because of the way she acts.  Shortly after this scene Jesse plays a really good song on the piano  loved the song he was playing but don't know the name of it.I think Why Stop Now being so short is the biggest problem.  The storyline needed more time to fully develop and stretch out the comedy segments becaues as it stands, it feels severely lacking.  Not a bad film though.

"IMHO the opening sequence, with the congressman being arrested, was very promising and quite funny. The rest of the show after that was uneven with very funny moments, like the drunken men shooting at the pumpkin in the basement and missing, mixed with not so funny moments, like the award speech for the ""normal"" marriage award. Come on guys; this should have been awkward as written but funnier. I love John Goodman and the mix of characters seems interesting.

"&#8230;and very little has changed. Unrepentant fans (not to mention &#8220;guilty pleasure&#8221; lurkers like myself) won't be disappointed. The team from the BFRO is still running around with thermo cameras in the middle of the night, shouting and screaming. The producer's ideas on how to get ratings up are just as absurd as usual: think Hawaiian luau + Bigfoot. And although the BFRO represents the &#8220;moderate&#8221; faction of Bigfooting, they believe the lot!One episode features a couple in Florida claiming that the local Bigfeet are bringing them gifts, when they aren't busy pelting their house with rocks.

Just talking about the method, I don't have a problem with.  However, I immediately have issue with the entire tone of the movie.  From the start, its very depressing, and it never quite gets away from it.  If you can get by this, or perhaps it doesn't bother you, you will probably find it a good movie.  It doesn't have the over done special effects like most movies, which was fine.  The story line is basically pretty tame too, but probably more real.  They didn't add a lot of BS human drama, either (thats a plus).  Its a fairly solid, down to earth movie (but you know, in space).

"A colleague asked that I view this season because there is an overlap in our specific medical interests. With heroine addiction as in other types of substance abuse, there is decreased ability in the body's immune system and infectious disease becomes more difficult to treat. I very much doubt that I would be able to accomplish what she does with interventions. There seems to be so much darkness before there can be light again . . . if death doesn't intervene! Yes, I do understand addiction and the absolute need for intervention and treatment. Diagnosing an infectious disease process for substance abusers requires treating both conditions . . . it's the same body mind. It was past difficult to observe that one intervention and this is certainly an accurate portrayal of the 'real' one.Recommended? That's a good question that I don't have a glib answer for . . . those considering an intervention? Substance abusers? Those interested in human behavior? Perhaps one episode if you are interested in finding a few answers to your own questions.The above was my review for Season 10. All of these episodes present variations of the 'typical' profile of substance abusers. This is not to negate an individuals circumstances but to emphasize their personalities. There is an accurate portrayal of dysfunction within the family unit and other relationships. The multiple substances of choice offer a wide spectrum and an accurate description of the medical mental consequences.I've viewed 'Chasing The White Dragon,' 'The Global Addiction,' 'Afghanistan: The Opium Trail,' and 'One Man's Seduction.'

"UNDER THE SKIN is a slow and cerebral, but intriguing sci fi film with a stellar lead performance by Scarlett Johansson. Going into this, I had no idea what I was in for. All I knew was that Scarlett Johansson was playing some kind of alien who abducts men in Scotland. It turned out to be quite a bit more than that, although the snail's pace at which the film unfolded was a little taxing for me at times. Jonathan Glazer is an outstanding visualist and this film has some rather haunting combinations of images and music that create an unnerving atmosphere. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job as the enigmatic main character. There isn't a whole lot of dialogue in this film, which could put off some viewers, but sometimes what one sees is as or more important than what one hears. I'm not really sure how to describe what happens in the film at the risk of spoiling anything, but suffice it to say that you'll be rewarded if you can make it until the end. Stylistically, it reminded me a bit of a sci fi film I watched before called BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW, inasmuch as the atmosphere created by the visuals and music combined are similar. Overall, I thought it was a decent film, although one that I'll probably wait awhile to watch again. I believe this has the potential to become a sci fi cljazzic, although it's likely to turn off a lot of viewers. Recommended, but be aware that this movie isn't for everyone.",A slow and cerebral sci-fi film,1405123200,"07 12, 2014",3,0
"Falling Skies started to take a turn for the worse in season 3 with the subplot of Anne's freaky baby. That the baby was ""different"" could have been shown subtly and without making it silly (the whole dismal mess reminded me of Chucky from theChild's Play (1988)film franchise). Season 4 starts with a dramatic attack by the Espheni, thinning out the ranks of our ragtag crew of heroes. A divide and conquer strategy is put into place by the fishheads, and the Volm are not in much of a position to help the human protagonists. Both context and gaping plot holes are established quickly in the first episode of s4.The one thing season 4 has going for it so far is that an Espheni overlord suggests to Tom that overwhelming threats greater than the Espheni are coming to Earth. This is a theme in sci fi that tends to work well. Your once most feared enemy starts to look like a puppy dog when compared to a bigger and badder foe that rolls into town. Take for example the Scarrans inFarscape: Complete Series, who made the Peacekeepers look like the Boy Scouts upon their entrance into the series.I am worried about the health of this serial due to the emphasis on Alexis the Supernatural, who is more fitting as one of Fox Mulder's cases than a character on the now cljazzic Falling Skies.

"This show is interesting to me since the featured mountain men (and jazzociated women) need to do certain things in order to survive due to their chosen lifestyle.  Still, the recaps when the show switches from one person to another are tedious.  For instance, one mountain man's dog keeps getting &#34;lost&#34; and a bear could eat it.  This goes on for several scenes but interspersed is another mountain man's need to fly his personal airplane to a remote cabin in Alaska, so viewers will be reintroduced to the &#34;missing&#34; dog scenario several times before the dog comes bounding home.  The dog goes missing twice in two different scenes   once out hunting and once at home   I found this to be contrived.To be fair, many shows do this now.  I suppose it is done to add airtime padding when no new film footage exists but I so dislike it.  For shows like Mystery Diagnosis which keeps my interest such that I want to find out what is ailing the person(s),  I record it so I can fast forward through the recaps.  What will transpire with the contrived scenario of the &#34;missing&#34; dog does not hold my interest enough for me to bother with it.

"I know the History Channel has faced a lot of criticism recently as their viewing schedule has veered away from cljazzic historical content to shows with more entertainment pizzazz. To my mind, ""Ancient Aliens"" seemed the perfect program to bridge the gap. Tales of mysterious and unexplained phenomenon, folklore and legend, and intergalactic speculation cross all international boundaries and are an inherent part of ancient history and cultural iconography. And as this documentary series began in its first season, it did a good job acknowledging the various interpretations of alien myths across the globe. However, the more we progress  the theories and or premises behind the show have become a little thinner, a little more hit or miss.  I suppose that was to be expected as the program has already delved into the biggest, most well known, and most supported mysteries in earlier seasons.  Thus, Season Three (while always entertaining) had its equal share of fascinating speculation intertwined with engaging historical insights AND with episodes of eye rolling lunacy.I think that's one of the problems of the show.  As it has evolved, it has become less about putting together one big theory and more about episodic nuggets that don't always flow together in a natural way.  Among the wackier entries of Season Three's sixteen episodes is the inclusion of Aliens as they might have influenced or been interrelated to other monsters (zombies and vampires, for example).  While both zombie and vampire legends have remarkable historical back stories that support their current worldwide interpretations, adding aliens to the mix is just a provocation.  Several of the episodes were such a stretch, I laughed more often than I was convinced of anything.The sixteen episodes are:  (1) Aliens and the Old West, (2) Aliens and Monsters, (3) Aliens and Sacred Places, (4) Aliens and Temples of Gold, (5) Aliens and Mysterious Rituals, (6) Aliens and Ancient Engineers, (7) Aliens, Plagues, and Epidemics, (8) Aliens and Lost Worlds, (9) Aliens and Deadly Weapons, (10) Aliens and Evil Places, (11) Aliens and the Founding Fathers, (12) Aliens and Deadly Cults, (13) Aliens and the Secret Code, (14) Aliens and the Undead, (15) Aliens, Gods, and Heroes, and (16) Aliens and the Creation of Man.First and foremost, ""Ancient Aliens"" is an entertainment program and if you have an interest in the topic (whether or not you believe it), it can be a fun show.  Just look at the episode titles if you are on the fence about how seriously you want to take this as science or history.  Aliens really can't be responsible for everything that has ever happened on Earth, can they?  So the further the show moves into speculative fantasy, the more ill fitting it seems to the History Channel.  But that doesn't mean that it isn't still a bit of fun.

"The basic argument of the film is that humans have been eating meat and plants for millions of years and our genetics haven't caught up with the relatively recent introduction of grains, starches and processed sugars and foods. It argues that humans were never herbivores since we need B12 to survive and this is only attainable from animal meat. There are plenty of proponents of this diet who provide evidence to support their point of view   pretty much none of it is in this documentary.This is a paleo diet promo and I'd recommend it if you've been watchingForks Over Knivesand similar documentaries to learn about dietary alternatives, only if it reinforces much of what those documentaries say. I couldn't honestly tell you if paleo or vegan is the way to go but there are clearly significant benefits to eliminating processed foods and increasing the amount of fresh food in your diet. The significant difference between the two diets is that vegan won't allow anything that comes from an animal and paleo won't allow anything that caveman couldn't find in the forest.In terms of this film, my major criticisms are that the production standards are pretty low and it's weak on providing supporting evidence. It has endless distracting graphics and animations that add nothing whatsoever and the main interviewer really wasn't the best guy to pick for the job. The vegan documentaries I've seen have been much more diligent in presenting their case. So paleo or vegan, it's your decision.

More often than not,  most Sci Fi hasn't developed varied plots, but for now, until the industry has more imaginative writers, it is ok. I prefer real science fiction, not blurred into fantasy of mythical beasts and vampires, which end up moving the imagination back into reality and snuffing out the momentum of plot advancement.My only suggestions are: keep it real with emotional responses, don't overdo it with fake shooting scenes, devise unique ways to solve problems (McGiverish), and grow the the characters relationships.

Everyone just seems like they are working up a flop sweat in order to tell the same jokes from previous seasons with diminishing returns.Had the show been canceled at season 5 it could have gone out on a high note.

"Samaritan(released Mar 12),otherwise known as Fury,stars Samuel L. Jackson as Foley,Gil Bellows as Bartender Bill,Tom Wilkinson as Xavier,Luke Kirby as Ethan and others.Filmed in and around Toronto,this drama of a grift con gone wrong,with a twist,is nothing we have not seen over and over again,and nothing in its make up suggests it to stand head and shoulders above the rest.The story involves an ex grifter,Jackson,who gets out of prison after 25 years.He went away for having been forced to kill his partner in crime.Now Kirby,his ex partner's son,is back and is dogging Jackson and wants an explanation as to why Jackson killed his dad.He gets a pretty grim story.The son is running a club,ultimately owned by Wilkinson,who comes around every so often to check out his property.Thrown into this mix is a young lady who Kirby gets to cozy up with Jackson.He spurns her advances but the next night she comes into a bar with a john,and he forces himself on her in the bathroom.He breaks up the situation and the young lady,after that night,keeps asking after Jackson repeatedly until one night she finds him.They end up a little drunk and back at her place.The two eventually end up sleeping together,with Jackson moving in.Things are starting to get a little too comfortable for Jackson who,with a suspicious eye,asks the girl if Kirby sent him.She admits at first he did but after it was her choice,as she developed real feelings for him.One day Kirby comes sniffing around yet again with an idea for a con.When Jackson refuses Kirby tells him that his girlfriend is really his daughter.Jackson is totally gobsmacked and gets physically sick.Jackson goes to a close friend of the woman he had the child with and who brought up his daughter and she confirms his suspicions.The next time though he meets Kirby,Kirby has a deal he cannot refuse or otherwise his daughter will find out the truth.Jackson is forced to go along with a grift to con Kirby's boss.Kirby enlists the aide of a lady who is totally familiar with the con game,but she ends up hanging herself at Kirby's apartment to get out from under Kirby's debt and the huge risk involved.Jackson walks out only to have Kirby show up at the bar he is in and he hands Jackson his phone.On the other end is his daughter pleading for his help.She is pretending to Wilkinson that she is Jacskon's daughter and she is in debt for $1.5 million.The con has started without him.Jackson may be enraged but he now must go along to save his daughter.Jackson appears at an abandoned house and the con begins.Just as things are rolling along Jackson daughter spills the beans and admits the whole thing is a con to Wilkinson,much to Jackson and Kirby's amazement.The girl also tells Jackson that she already knows she is his daughter.When the dust all clears Kirby and Wilkinson are dead and Jackson is severely wounded and his daughter near death.Jackson rushes her to a prison friend who knows a little bit of doctoring skills.He is forced to give his daughter a blood transfusion,which unfortunately ends up killing him.The film ends as his daughter,with a renewed life,and the money earned from the con gone bad,is walking on a tropical beach.The story certainly has its twists and turns and the cast,especially Jackson,are on game throughout.The picture is ably directed and edited but there is just nothing here out of the ordinary to speak of to set it apart from a myriad of other such films from the past,recent and older.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w s a r of 2:35:1.Extras include interviews and a featurette.All in all a pedestrian film of grifting and its consequences.An average film with an average mark.","Samaritan-yet another story of conning,gone wrong",1360195200,"02 7, 2013",3,0

"Bobcat's last film, &#34;God Bless America,&#34; was a phenomenal achievement in dark satire. For his first foray into horror (depending on how you view 'Shakes the Clown'), Bobcat goes found footage for the tale of an obsessed Bigfoot hunter who drags his girlfriend into the deep woods to try to find Sasquatch. The film is 90 percent build up, with very little actually happening for the first 40 minutes or so. It's interesting and well done, and some of the dialogue is razor sharp, but it's clear Bobcat is trying to really build a sense of anticipation and he sadly over extends his efforts with a near 15 minutes straight segment inside of a tent. I get what he was trying to do, and it is effective to a point, but the last 10 minutes or so spiral into a hodge podge of found footage tropes (abstract camera angles, off camera screams, POV perspective while running) with only one true, genuine money shot that is so quick, blink and miss it, that you feel cheated. It's worth watching for free on cable, but I don't know if I can recommend the rental fee.",Strong effort but leaves you wanting more,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",3,0
"Yet another police procedural right out of the basic TV Writers Guide to Cop Shows. From the same source as Chicago Fire, it follows the same template.  However, that is a miracle of realism compared to this show.  Here we have an intelligence unit (maybe THE intelligence unit, even big departments don't usually have more than one) which seems to perform few of the functions of an intelligence unit.  The unit also seems darn small for a major department and is apparently populated mostly by former calendar models.  Then there is the usual hard bitten, street smart, brutal when required sergeant who performs few of the functions of a sergeant.  We also have the now standard TV organization of mostly white people with a black guy in charge.  Now, it would not make for exciting TV to watch these guys trolling through databases and writing reports for 51 minutes.

"Stanley Kubrick is one of the all time great directors. He puts a lot of thought into his films. But is the ride worth the fare?Here's the scoop. A hand full of film enthusiasts felt there was more to the Kubrick's &#34;The Shining&#34; than meets the eye. So they did some research and watched the film over and over to get it to reveal its secrets. Many secrets there are and Kubrick went out of his way to bury these within the film. But, having found them, is &#34;The Shining&#34; any better for it?There is little if any doubt of Kubrick's precision as a director. This is noted by any number of film critics as well as other directors. So, when these folk uncover all these hidden aspects, most of them are probably right on. Some are grasping at straws. The section of super imposing the film playing backward over it playing forward is an entire waste of time. But much else is very convincing. I truly took pause on the conspiracy angle pegging him as the director of the first American moon landing. This has been floating around for decades but this is some of the better evidence I've seen. But, does it make it a better viewing experience or is it just better for the puzzle solving crowd?One thing that always frustrated me in viewing film is trying to determine how smart a director was. Did I miss something in the movie? Did the director mean a certain something or did he brew up? I don't always trust myself so I can't always rust the director. But subtext matters. In &#34;The Exorcist&#34; putting a fiercely changing society as a backdrop for the narrative does work on a subliminal level. But some of what these viewers find in &#34; The Shining&#34; is buried so deep I can't imagine it working on any level that would add to the film. It might be genius at work but it's only for the few who endeavor to dig really deep to find it.This is well worth seeing, but maybe not for the reasons the film makers intended.",But Does it Matter?,1390262400,"01 21, 2014",3,0
"From the strange to the sublime, few filmmakers have fascinated me more than David Cronenberg. The Canadian auteur has made some of my all time favorites, and his distinctive sense of macabre humor and his skewed world view is in evidence even in his most mainstream work. With a string of great films that included Scanners, Videodrome, The Dead Zone, The Fly and Dead Ringers, he earned a nickname (a personal favorite) as the King of Venereal Horror. But not to limit himself to genre work, he also scored accolades for his interpretation of Naked Lunch, A History of Violence, and Eastern Promises. I love Cronenberg in case you couldn't tell! So I was definitely intrigued when I heard his son Brandon was making his directorial debut with ""Antiviral."" The strangely compelling and oftentimes disturbing ""Antiviral"" is eerily reminiscent in both themes and tone of some of his father's earlier work. The apple doesn't seem to have fallen too far from the proverbial tree. While it's too still too soon to say, might we have the Prince of Venereal Horror?""Antiviral"" is set in the not too distant future where celebrity idolization has taken on a creepy new dimension. In the antiseptic offices of a modern medical complex, ordinary citizens consult with sales people who can promise unprecedented access to their favorite stars. How? By injecting a disease into their system that originated inside the celebrity in question. My reference to venereal horror, in this case, has direct bearing on this movie! One of the most effective scenes has the technician lining up a shot of oral herpes on a patient where it would have been had it come directly from the lips of the donor starlet. This set up, in my opinion, is fresh and totally original and I loved its decidedly satiric bent. Caleb Landry Jones plays the clinic employee who is gaming the system. He smuggles out newly acquired viruses by injecting himself and sells them to piracy groups. Things get complicated, however, when he takes the new disease of the clinic's most popular subject (Sarah Gadon). When her mysterious death is reported, Landry Jones just may find himself in irrevocable trouble.As ""Antiviral"" progresses, it unravels as an elaborately demented conspiracy theory. Different factions are fighting for supremacy in this brave new world and Landry Jones is caught in between. The movie itself is really hard to cljazzify. Some of its macabre gruesomeness might lend it the feel of a horror movie, but it is more of a science fiction puzzler. As the plot becomes more convoluted, the movie loses some of its humor (I really enjoyed it as a celebrity obsessed satire). And in the end, I'm not sure I was fully satisfied with its resolutions. But one thing is certain, you've never seen anything quite like it. Landry Jones is terrific in the lead role and character actors Wendy Crewson and Malcolm McDowell score in smaller roles. ""Antiviral"" is not for everyone. With its methodical pacing, you've got to have patience. It may. in fact, be a love it or hate it proposition. While I thought the concept was genius, I didn't necessarily love the movie as a whole. But by being audacious and different, Brandon Cronenberg has caught my eye and is someone I'll look out for.

"Director Neil Jordan has made some fantastic movies, some of the well known and others not quite so. From INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE to MONA LISA, his films are never boring and always offer more story than most. Such is the case with his latest to hit DVD, ONDINE.Colin Farrell stars as Syracuse, Circus to his friends due to his clownish attitude when he was once a raging alcoholic. Sober for over two years, Syracuse is a fisherman in a small town off the coast of Ireland. Miraculously one day he reels in his net to find a woman (Alicja Bachleda) there along with the fish. Fortunately she's alive and he takes her back with him. But for some reason she insists that he not take her to a hospital or let anyone see her.Syracuse answers her requests and takes her to a secluded bay where his late mother's house remains. Allowing her to stay there she tells him when asked that her name is Ondine, which means ""she came from the sea"". Unsure of what to do, Syracuse leaves to take care of an important meeting he's late for.That meeting is taking his daughter to the hospital for treatment. Annie (Allison Barry) is an intelligent 10 year old whose kidneys are failing her. Syarcuse is a doting father who sits with her through the entire treatment. When he volunteers to tell her a story during the treatment, she makes him follow through and he begins a tale of a fisherman who casts his net only to haul in a mermaid, a selkie in Celtic mythology.While Syracuse returns to the cottage where Ondine is, Annie thinks there is more to his story than just a tall tale and begins doing research on the selkie. At the same time, Ondine insists on going out with Syracuse fishing the next day. For some reason when she sings, Syracuse seems to reel in more fish than he ever has before. Could she truly be a mermaid?While Annie makes a secret trip to the cottage and gets the chance to meet Ondine, Syracuse makes a stop at the local church. From time to time, he spends time in the confessional talking to the priest there (Stephen Rea). He opens up to him not as a priest but as someone he can talk to, reveal himself to, knowing that it won't turn into gossip. The bond between these two is felt throughout the movie, though one gets the idea that Syracuse is not a regular churchgoer.As the story progresses, Annie grows attached to Ondine. Time spent with her results in a secret that the two share, something found in the water that Ondine buries that will come into play near the end of the film when the magic turns to more dark reality.Annie isn't the only one who grows fond of Ondine. Syracuse falls in love with her as well. Not only does he fall for her, he feels that perhaps her being with him brings a certain amount of good fortune too. And being a man whose lost all hope, it also brings about a distinct amount of fear in him as well, fear that something bad is coming. Could there be something in Ondine's past that will return to plague them? Or is she really magical?The combination of fantasy and dark reality make for interesting viewing with this film. As with most films Jordan has made, the story is never rushed or the film padded with unnecessary chases or fights to lengthen it or make it move faster. Jordan instead tells a story in a smooth fashion that for some will seem slow given the frenetic pace of most movies today. But in giving the movie a chance, you'll find that story truly does matter.Farrell does a commendable job as Syracuse, a man without hope who fears for his daughter, who has allowed himself to be put down for years for the things he did in his past. We get only glimpses of those things in word and action, but somehow Farrell gives us more information with a shrug or attitude than we might get with a long winded monologue.Both Alicja Bachleda and Annie Barry are wonderful in their roles here. They may not have garnered the name recognition that Farrell has but given the opportunity both could become major stars.The movie presents a gorgeous look at Ireland and the seaside town where it was filmed. It presents a tale that draws you in rather than slaps you around. And it takes time to let that story unfold. Jordan has always been a storyteller. And with ONDINE, he remains one of the best.",FANTASY AND REALITY COMBINE,1285459200,"09 26, 2010",3,0

"i'll preface my lukewarm review by saying a man is not a movie, and it is necessary to set aside the man in order to review the movie. one can ask: what would ebert himself have said about this film?this story falls into two distinct parts. the documentary part concerns the life and times of roger ebert, boy journalist, adult editor and larger than life, groundbreaking movie critic and television personality. this is interesting as biography and as a historical look at journalism in the days before media empires made newspapers obsolete and cable channels made broadcast television irrelevant. compiled from archive materials and latter day interviews, all this material is fascinating and enlightening.the travails part of the film is entirely focused on ebert's disfiguring, debilitating and agonizing medical troubles, including close ups of painful medical procedures and the terrible deformities that had to be accepted as the price of ""affirming life"". this is absolutely a necessary part of the ebert story and ebert was courageous to permit the extensive filming.it's unfortunate that these two parts don't work together. part of the problem is incredibly indulgent editing (i could predict during the movie that director james was also an editor) that makes this film about 30 minutes too long and makes the life appear almost secondary to its end. but part of the problem is omission: ebert is healthy, then he is sick; he's a TV personality, then he's a blogger. by jumping back and forth between present and past, and focusing far too much on the gruesome present, we jump over the crucial transition. the two years between ebert's cancer diagnosis and his public announcement that he was ""a sick man"" is a blank; ""ebert and roeper"" is ignored. the progress of his disease is merely common: it's the response of the man to the disease that is significant. it's not a transition that can be tracked in ebert's own voiceover, reading pjazzages from ""life itself"", because surgery took away his voice.ebert was a populist, but he was no sentimentalist. he could approve a benji movie because it was appropriate for its audience of children. what is the audience for this film? if it's the sentimental ebert fans who adore his reviews and worship his memory, then it's probably an admirable work. despite its candor about ebert's bullying, egotistical temperament, this is really a tribute film, a two hour eulogy: it was directed and produced by filmmakers whom ebert helped in their careers.as someone who admires ebert but hardly to excess, and doesn't really care about his interest in used bookstores, his father or his walks in the park, i found this film lost its way in its desire to cram in every biographic detail and share his final months at every step, yet omit the process by which ebert reinvented his career and faced his end without losing his journalistic integrity.",how would ebert review this film?,1404864000,"07 9, 2014",3,0
"***1 2""Red Cliff"" provides us with a view of 3rd Century China as only famed action director John Woo could conceive of it:  that is to say filled with endless battle scenes that are as preposterously over the top and physics defying as they are sanguinary and riveting.It's a tale of a group of lesser clan leaders who band together to defeat the dreaded Cao Cao, who with his army of 800,000 well trained and fully equipped warriors, is fully intent on claiming all of China for his own.  The filmmakers have come up with a number of diverting plot twists to keep the story from becoming stale and redundant, and there are enough discussions of fogbanks and directional wind shifts to fill a week's worth of ""When Weather Changed History"" programming.At a nearly two and a half hour long running time, the movie is lengthy and exhausting, and occasionally rather confusing to follow, but the handsome production values and epic battle scenes should keep hardcore fans of the genre rooted to their seats for the duration.

I loved the design and I loved the idea thta I could work this into my collection. I had gotten plenty of things that did not fit exactly rigth and, to be honest, I was not worried. I loved the way it looked adn i loved the way it seemd to be a centerpiece. The problem was that it was nothing like what i envisioned.When I got the set, there was an issue of sliding DVDs that really made life a mess. Considering the investment there was not turning back, and that meant that I was stuck with something that didn't work out. I always take my DVDs out of the packaging when they are weirdly designed, too, trying to keep them from harm. Still, this is not one of those things you could do. The packaging already did a number of some of the DVDs and, sadly, I was left picking up the scratches. I'm glad they have new sets to get rid of those but, beyond that, there is the idea of getting what you pay for. I paid for a set, a pretty set, and i got a marred notion of what pretty can become. considering the complaints I have seen around, i would say this is a universal trend.In conclusion, buy the set but not the box. It will make life better for you.","Series - 4.5 stars, Pacaging 2 stars",1290556800,"11 24, 2010",3,0

"""Hounddog"" is a fairly predictable period piece about a young girl growing up in the rural south in the 1950's.  Dakota Fanning is impressive as a 12 year old obsessed with Elvis Presley, and the supporting cast (David Morse as her womanizing father, Robin Wright Penn as her would be mother, and Piper Laurie as her tipsy grandmother) is fine as well.  I'm not sure what all the fuss was about   there's nothing particularly controversial about this film.  Yes, there's a rape scene   but nothing shown in this film couldn't be shown on network television during prime time.  Compare this to the harrowing (and deservedly controversial) ""Bastard out of Carolina"" and you'll see what I mean   both films are set in the same time period, with similar characters and circumstances.  But while ""Hounddog"" offers up clich&eacute;s as answers, ""Bastard"" forces its audience to confront the realities of poverty, child abuse, and rape.The problem with ""Hounddog"" isn't that it stretches the boundaries of morality and good taste   it's that the film itself is so derivative.  It feels like an odd mix of ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes,"" and ""Carrie""   lots of nice scenes of dirt poor kids bonding in swimming holes and corn fields with a little holy roller craziness thrown in for good measure (Piper Laurie's character seems cut from the same cloth as her role as Sissy Spacek's mother in ""Carrie"").  This is a pretty film, with lovely country vistas and a nice hazy nostalgic quality that can be captivating on its own.  But there's nothing new here   just about everything that happens is predictable, including the final scene.  And all the snake symbolism is way, way overdone (I get it, I get it   ""stay out of the tall grjazz"").This is not a bad film, and it is worth seeing.  It is not, however, worth getting worked up over.  If you don't like ""Hounddog"" it won't be because it sexually exploits children.  It does not.  It just tries to present a picture of what it would be like to grow up poor and alone in a world that doesn't offer much support.  This movie is not about sex; it's about loneliness.

"At the time of this review, ""Dracula"" has not yet been commissioned for a second season, and opinions are evenly divided on whether or not it'll get one. Composed of ten episodes, there's very little here that resemblesBram Stoker's novel(beyond the names of the characters), and much that has been borrowed from Francis Ford Coppola's take on the story inhis 1992 film.Not that this is a bad thing. Although there's nothing out there that I'd call the ""definitive"" adaptation of Dracula, neither do I insist on absolute fidelity to source material,  especially with material that's as well trod as the Dracula mythos (not to mention the recent resurgence of the vampire genre). As long as what I'm watching is fresh and interesting, I'm game for any reimagining. So what is it that creators Cole Haddon and Daniel Knauf bring to the table?This take on Dracula is a mixed bag of intriguing ideas and wasted potential, in which the titular vampire is wakened from a centuries long slumber by Abraham van Helsing, seeking to use him as an unlikely ally in his war against the powerful Order of the Dragon.  Posing as an American industrialist called Alexander Grayson, Dracula arrives in London in the year 1896, eager to revenge himself on the sect responsible for murdering his wife and cursing him with immortality.Pros:The general premise  Although I'm still awaiting an adaptation of Dracula that is 100% faithful to Bram Stoker's original novel (the BBC miniserieshas probably come the closest), I like that this show isn't afraid to march way off the beaten track and present what is pretty much an entirely original story with a few familiar faces.Here Mina Murray is not a teacher but a medical student, Jonathan Harker not a lawyer but a journalist, Renfield no longer a sycophantic slave but Dracula's trusted manservant. Lucy Westenra is (still) a socialite but with a secret regarding her sexuality, and Abraham van Helsing is a barely hinged professor who tenuously holds the reins when it comes to controlling Dracula's bloodthirsty urges. Though there's no sign of Arthur Holmwood or Doctor Seward, newcomer Lady Jane Wetherby picks up the vampire slaying slack as an aristocratic noble women who moonlights as a vampire hunter.Though Bram Stoker was inspired by the historical Vlad &#538;epe&#537; in his creation of Dracula, this adaptation makes the link between the two figures explicit, rendering Vlad and Dracula one and the same. And though Francis Ford Coppola was not the first film maker to forge a romantic bond between Dracula Mina, he certainly popularized the notion, and the conceit is carried on here by portraying Mina as Dracula's reincarnated wife Ilona   which naturally throws a spanner in van Helsing's carefully formulated plans.The production values  Make no mistake; this show is a feast for the eyes. From the set design (opulent ballrooms, candle lit restaurants, gleaming solariums) to the costumes (the sumptuous ball gowns, glittering jewelry, Mina's array of cute little hats) to the elegant cinematography and soundtrack, everything about ""Dracula"" is stunningly beautiful. The world that they've created bears little resemblance to what Victorian London would have *actually* looked like, for there are anachronisms everywhere, but it has a unique style all its own, with a dash of steampunk and a glossy sheen.Performances  Forgive the pun, but all the cast sink their teeth in their roles with great enthusiasm. Jonathan Rhys Meyer seethes with his trademark intensity, but other standouts include Nonso Anozie as the efficient Renfield and Katie McGrath, who breaks away from her usual bad girl role (as seen inMerlin) to paint Lucy as a rather tragic figure in unrequited love with her best friend.Jessica de Gouw is certainly very beautiful as Mina Murray, though after a few episodes focusing on her medical career, she's reduced to bride to be, damsel in distress and object of male affection, and Thomas Kretschmann is sadly underused as an otherwise riveting van Helsing. Peppered throughout the supporting cast are a number of familiar British actors: Andrew Lee Potts, Robert Bathurst, Jemma Redgrave and Neve McIntosh to name a few. Their names may not ring any immediate bells, but if you're a fan of BBC television I guarantee you'll recognize them.Cons:The storyline  Basically, this is the cast ofDraculain the plot ofThe Count of Monte Cristo, which is no bad thing save that one crucial element is missing: a reason to care. When Edmond Dantes is unjustly sent to the Chteau d'If for crimes he didn't commit, the audience is on the edge of their seat in anticipation for him to unleash retribution on those that framed him.Yet the alliance of Dracula van Helsing versus the Order of the Dragon has no resonance to it simply because we have no firm understanding of why the vendetta exists in the first place. We're given a few flashbacks that depict each man's family being brutally murdered, but as to WHY the Order decided to inflict such punishment goes completely unexplained. Not helping is the fact that Dracula and van Helsing's respective families are complete cyphers, devoid of any personalities, whose deaths are a tragedy only because the show tells us it is.Also unsatisfying is the way both men go about wrecking vengeance. After a certain point you begin to wonder why van Helsing even resurrected Dracula in the first place   he leaves a trail of dead bodies in his wake, he refuses to follow the plan, and he usually ends up being more trouble than he's worth. You'd think that Dracula's involvement would at least have been justified by van Helsing's need for someone to inflict brutal violence on their mutual enemies, but not only does it turn out that van Helsing is more than capable of committing murder all on his own, but his plan revolves almost entirely around ""Alexander Grayson"" introducing geomagnetic technology to the mjazzes as part of a ploy to undermine the Order's power by threatening their monopoly on foreign oil supply.Why'd he need Dracula for that? Surely there were others he could have called upon to impersonate an American businessman, and it's all ultimately negated when Helsing goes ahead and takes revenge on his mortal foe without Dracula's involvement at all.Damn love triangles  Is anyone else sick to death of these things? It seems that there isn't a single film, show or book these days that doesn't consider itself complete unless there are characters vying for each other's affection, often in childish and inexplicable ways. ""Dracula"" does one better and introduces what's best described as a love dohecahedron. Jonathan loves Mina, who is the reincarnated wife of Dracula, who finds herself drawn to Alexander Grayson, who is busy seducing Lady Jane, who notices that Lucy is also in love with Mina, who encourages her to express her feelings as part of a roundabout plot to drive a wedge between Alexander and Mina after noticing their mutual attraction, who goes ahead with confessing her love to Mina, who when rebuffed, then sleeps with Jonathan in order to get back at Mina... oy.All these love triangle shenanigans take up a LOT of screen time and very little of it makes sense. Furthermore, the show ultimately presents Mina Dracula as the ""official couple"", even though we're given very little reason to care about them. The actors don't have a huge amount of chemistry, the characters don't spend a lot of time together, and to simply state that Mina is the reincarnation of Dracula's wife is an incredibly lazy way of insisting to the audience that their attraction to one another is ""true love.""In a show that has a vampire as its lead character, there's disappointingly very little vampirism in the show itself. Far too much screen time is spend on these tedious intrigues, and they have very little purpose beyond getting people to lash out at each other in increasingly erratic ways.Inconsistencies  Yeah, there are quite a few of these, and most of them are pretty glaring. I've already mentioned the ultimate pointlessness of van Helsing's reliance on Dracula, but so many components of the storyline make very little sense. Why can't Jane, an accomplished vampire hunter, tell that the man she's sleeping with doesn't have a pulse? Why would Lord Davenport, searching for Grayson's weakness, deduce that he's in love with Mina Murray based on his possession of a five hundred year old painting that depicts a woman who looks a little like her?Why doesn't Harker check his sources before publishing a devastating article accusing a man of treason? Having pretty clearly established Lucy as a virgin, why does she later look like she knows exactly what she's doing in the bedroom? Why on earth would the Order ""punish"" Dracula by turning him into an immortal vampire that could potentially threaten all their lives?We learn at one point that vampires are being drawn to London thanks to Dracula's presence there. But why are they gathering? Is he doing it on purpose? Does he even know about it?Other plot points are raised only to be completely ignored. At one point Mina injects a dead rat with vampire blood and packs it away again before she notices its leg twitching. It's never brought up again. At another point Dracula investigates Jane's house, finds a female vampire locked up in her basement, tearfully kisses her hand and then returns to bed. And... that's it. Nothing more ever comes of it.Conclusion:""Dracula"" is a glossy and stylish reinvention of the character that is not without merit   just without direction. I remain somewhat confused as to whether we're supposed to view this particular Dracula as an anti hero or an out and out villain, and the dwindling likeability of all the other characters means that my investment in them faded as the episodes went on.Whether the show will get a second season remains to be seen, though as the bloodbath in the final episode kills off most of its best characters, there's a chance that even if it does come back, a significant portion of its audience may not.","""From This Night and Every Night Until They Yield - Blood Will Flow...""",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",3,0

Based off the ending I would say watch it still, but shut it off with a half hour left and have someone tell you the ending. Very disappointing. Overall, a very good movie for most of it. I give it a B  (would have been higher if ending was better.)","A tense, exciting and great movie for the first hour. Last half hour was slow and ruined the beginning.

"V H S 2 (or S V H S) is the sequel to the horror anthology last year, and darn if it still isn't one of the most entertaining horror movies to come out in recent years. The structure is identical to the original where some people break into a house and find a bunch of VHS tapes, with some more mythology added on to the overarching story without explaining much. The shorts themselves are one less then the last one. So how are the shorts overall? Well, none of them were really scary, instead they're more just fun and creepy at times. Also the tapes themselves are all basically average instead of the wild variety of quality from the original. So while there's no short on here as good as Amateur Night, there's none as boring terrible as Second Honeymoon. Let's go over them, worst to best:Slumber Party Alien Abduction   While the kids were good at playing kids (and not dumb horror kids that quietly stare at the camera) and the set up was fun, the actual alien payoff was overall disappointing. Maybe it's because grey aliens aren't automatically spooky for me but after the aliens are there the aftermath is run hide run hide, and the camera simultaneously shows too much of the aliens while showing too little with the atmosphere. Could've been much better if the camera followed the kids up into the saucer or something. However the CPR scene was pretty darn creepy.A Ride in the Park   A guy with a camera on his helmet goes for a bike ride and runs into the living dead or something. The zombies were pretty well designed and it had an interesting twist on the genre by showing a first person perspective of a zombie. Also like Slumber Party Alien Abduction, there could've been more. Instead the short ends after the zombie gets a call from his girlfriend and kills himself, or something cheesy like that. However one thing that caught me by surprise was that this segment was pretty funny at times, and I don't think it took itself too seriously with some of the stuff.Phase 1 Clinical Trials   Basically the Sixth Sense on camera. A guy gets an experimental eye camera put in his head where he can see dead people around his house. The premise was pretty creepy and some of the designs were unsettling, I liked this one more than the other two since it was pretty spooky in parts. The main actor had some pretty funny reactions to the stuff going on and the girl had an interesting yet impractical method of avoiding the ghosts.Safe Haven   The craziest of the segments by far, similar to the orignal's 10 31 98 where insane stuff happens on camera. In this one a crew of cameramen go to a cult in Indonesia where the leader promises the usual shangri la stuff. The cameramen are pretty weirded out and try to extort some dirty secrets about the place, until the time comes for the cult to claim absolution. When that happens the entire compound turns into a suicide cult, and that might be a weird enough place to end the segment, but the director goes above and beyond afterwards, where the aftermath is straight crazy. This segment has been a bit over hyped by people but still, Safe Haven delivered on the goods.So all in all, V H S 2 was a consistent ride of average segments, none too terrible, and none really amazing. Maybe I've been spoiled by Amateur Night though and was going into this expecting more horror than anything, but for what it is, V H S 2 is still a hell of a fun time to watch.",S-V/H/S,1370822400,"06 10, 2013",3,0

"This review contains spoilers...!I found this film appealing in some ways but confusing in others.  I kept wondering what Sarah Polley was trying to do and then, the next day I remembered her autobiographical film, ""Stories We Tell"" which seems to me to explain the murky parts in this one.In ""Stories We Tell"" which came out the year after this, Polley reveals that the man she thought was her real father was  not, that her mother had had an extended affair with another man who was Sarah's biological father. Sarah's mother as played in that film, as well as actual footage of her, bears a strong resemblance to Michelle Williams's character.  They are both young, beautiful, blond, vivacious and sexy.  They are both artistically inclined but frustrated.  Sarah's mother was a sometimes actress and Michelle's character is a sort of writer.  Both leave their safe, loving, respectable husbands for artist types, one a painter and one a film maker.  In Sarah Polley's mother's case she did return to the family but died soon afterward.  I had to wonder how much of this film was an attempt on the part of Sarah to make sense to herself of her own mother's behavior.  She succeeds beautifully in ""Stories We Tell"" but in this film, it doesn't quite work.The supposed moral of this film, is ""the grjazz is always greener..."" Or as the alcoholic sister in law puts it, that there is always something missing and one just has to find ways to deal with that hole.  Here the Michelle Williams character leaves her dull but dutiful husband for a more exciting one, but in the end it seems that happiness once again has eluded her and she seem to find her happiness by herself as shown in the last scene, where she rides alone on the amusement park ride.The idea that one can't look to another to fill up the empty hole inside is a valid one. The problem here is that the film doesn't really show that the second relationship is all that bad.  It seems like the characters Sarah Polley wrote took off with their own lives and left her intention in the dust.  Their romance in gorgeous and hot and totally believable.  Who wouldn't leave the poor chubby chicken cooking hubby for the sexy, exciting, and NICE, painter (and rickshaw driver!)  Her hubby's idea of sexual foreplay is to talk baby talk, while the other guy practically sends her into orbit at their conversation over Martinis.  That and the underwater scene in the pool were the two highlights of the film, in my opinion, with the waltz to the Leonard Coehn song, a close third.  I'd almost buy the film for those scenes.So it was not all believable to me that suddenly this very beautiful romance is shown to be have turned sour.  The threesomes in bed seemed totally out of character.  This guy wasn't a cheap sleaze out for kicks and I don't think she was either.  A more realistic development to me would be that they'd have the children that she wanted and which her husband avoided having.It seems to me that the Sarah couldn't let her characters get away with their actions  and have a happy life together, that she had to make them wrong somehow.  Boo!  I saw the film more as a coming of age film for the female character.  She married the nice, safe, secure Daddy guy and they talked baby talk to each other in bed and played other silly games  At one point when  she outgrows that and asks him to do lose the baby talk he pouts and goes back to frying his chicken.  No wonder she was ready for the next stage in her development   a real, adult sexy guy who would definitely deliver.  I just think that Polley copped out by showing that romance as a symptom of the woman's weakness.  The film itself, belies that message.  I found the ending scene with Michelle alone in the amusement park ride not at all convincing, a failed attempt to make a point that she was forcing on her characters.",Some lovely moments but the film doesn't quite work,1380326400,"09 28, 2013",3,0

"POLITICAL ANIMALS is being advertised as a limited series so it is doubtful it will be around for more than a few episodes. Maybe that is why it tries to cram so many subplots and shaky character definitions into the space of 1 1 2 hours. The series lists four writers   Greg Berlanti, Geoffrey Nauffts, Molly Newman, and Speed Weed   and perhaps this committee approach is part of the rough result of a script that simply doesn't hang together enough to even whet our interest.Much has been written about this series being a parody of the Clintons: not only is that an unfair evaluation but it is also an insult to the Clintons. But whatever the reason for building this series, the story SEEMS to be the following: Bud Hammond (Ciaran Hinds in a deplorable and false Southern accent) is an ex president, a man whose affairs and sexual liaisons have been fodder for the press more than coverage of important data. His ex wife Elaine Barrish (Sigourney Weaver) is the current Secretary of State to Pop art president Paul Garcetti (Adrian Pasdar). Elaine and Bud have two adult boy children   Thomas (Sebastian Stan) a drug addicted gay loser and Doug (James Wolk) who is about to be married to a Japanese girl with bulimia. Elaine is being followed by a journalist (Carla Guigino) who is more interested in gossip than fact. In the midst of all the parties to meet the bride to be's parents, Thomas' attempt to get financing to create a new night club, and Bud's constant parade of busty women, and Elaine's mother (Ellen Burstyn, the best thing about this series) making caustic comments about Bud's girlfriends and the status quo of the nation, along comes an Iran crisis where three American journalists have been captured, tried and are threatened with execution unless someone acts. The President and his numbskull vice president (Dylan Baker) do nothing so of course Elaine as Secretary of State must act with her journalist tagging along, now a bit more understanding because her boyfriend editor is cheating on her da da da da da. And all of this is delivered with as much profanity as can be stuffed into a show.Sigourney Weaver looks great but doesn't seem convinced about the character she is portraying. Ciaran Hinds doesn't have a chance with the absurd dialogue he barfs out, and the rest of the cast   with the sole exception of Ellen Burstyn who is brilliant and has (who knows why?) all of the dialogue that is intelligently written. Perhaps with the next installments there will be some improvement in dialogue and subplot ideas and less onscreen emesis and coke snorting. If not the series will remain as titled   a brief series.

"I honestly don't like this season, espically since I don't care for the two seasons before this one, and I really hope the show redeems itself with the next one. Why do I not like it? It's not too hard to explain, first this season had too many twists in it and these twists were executed poorly (how I can't say as I'd have to spoil the season), also 16 people is way too many people for this show, you got the feeling early on that there wouldn't be many likeable people and finally all the bad remarks made by the houseguests.That last one however is the killer, there was so many bad remarks the producers couldn't even air all of them. Worse they try and edit the show so that one or two houseguests look the bad guy and are opposed by the others, when in reality half of the others were laughing at the remarks earlier. Sources have revealed to me that many houseguests lost their jobs because of these remarks. Stuff like that should be revealed even though that would've alienated even more people.Ultimatly this show suffers pretty much the same fate as season 13, nice season gameplay wise, but not many likeable people and many bad remarks being issued. The final winner was the right choice out of the last few but wasn't that great. Ultimatly like with Big Brother 9, I think this seaosn is going to gradually hushed up by CBS and won't be mentioned if possible.

"It's always an event when a Stephen King book is adapted into a movie or miniseries. With &#34;Under the Dome,&#34; we now have an ongoing television show from the master of suspense and horror. Although it's more sci fi than terrifying, it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat at times. After binge watching the entire first season, I have to say I was expecting a little more than what I got.Chester's Mill is a seemingly perfect example of small town America from the outside. On the inside, its citizens are entangled in all sorts of dramatic and compromising situations. Things get even tenser when a dome seals the town off from the rest of the world. With no rescue in sight, the community comes unhinged as they come to grips with food, water, and medical supply shortages. All the while, the leaders of Chester's Mill search for the answer to where the dome came from and what does whoever put it there want from them.By no means is &#34;Under the Dome&#34; as perfect or addictive as &#34;Revenge&#34; and other shows out there. It doesn't have the same level of urgency to see the next episode like that. I'm also left with the stinging suspicion that when everything does come to an end, I'm going to be left disappointed. That could be four seasons away, though. I should just sit back and enjoy the ride until the bitter end.I came into the show thinking it was a 13 episode series that would conclude with its final installment. When the credits rolled on the last chapter to this box set, I was left stunned. I find myself asking, &#34;How are they going to keep this thing going for several more seasons?&#34;The characters in &#34;Under the Dome&#34; are engaging and likeable (or hateable, some would say). You have the group of kids you feel sorry for because they want to find a way out and continue living there lives. There's also a crooked police officer, a politician used car dealer, and a preacher who will no doubt raise your blood pressure and leave you screaming at the TV in disgust at their deplorable actions.&#34;Under the Dome&#34; is definitely what I would consider to be PG 13. There are sexual situations, violence, and bad language. It's not as gory as you might expect to get from a Stephen King adaptation, but this isn't that type of movie.There are some pleasing special features spread throughout the four discs contained in the &#34;Under the Dome&#34; box set. Five featurettes go behind the scenes of the series and include interviews with author executive producer Stephen King and the cast and crew. Deleted scenes, a gag reel, and launch promos can also be found.I will say that &#34;Under the Dome&#34; is intriguing television. It keeps you coming back for more and wondering how the whole story will unfold. I'd say something about just reading the book for the answers, but I've heard that the show is going to deviate from King's novel quite a bit.","Stephen King's ""Under the Dome"" Comes Home",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",3,0

"As a Portland resident, I'll admit that it's nice to see the town in high quality photography, and I'll agree that most of the caricatures are quite spot on. However, I've never been a great fan of the show for a couple reasons. One is that the same ideas are milked over and over, often using the same characters, with no new ground being broken. The feminist bookstore is probably the best example: Each successive skit in that setting seems to be just a variation on the original idea, without reaching for additional substance or a new perspective. Another problem is that Armisen and especially Brownstein seem to equate inarticulate mugging with comedy. This just in: They're not the same thing. Sputtering your lines, raising your eyebrows or tossing objects is no substitute for true humor. There are some skits that are nice in the way that a short poem is, and of all the routines in this season I think the Battlestar Galactica one is truly inspired, though it does go on a little too long in the middle. This series is adequately diverting most of the time, but it's hardly as good as it thinks it is.

"CENTURION (2010, 97 minutes) is a fine endless battle and chase and battle and final gigantic showdown battle Roman era film. That is, if you like this sort of meaningless tripe action film. Set in 117 A.D., and as always centering on the mysteriously vanished 9th Legion, Michael Fjazzbender actually gives an unusually riveting performance as Centurion Quintus Dias. That's right, they gave him a Spanish name that probably wasn't even in existence yet, but Romans will be Romans in whatever century they occupy.Of course, as I translate the only half authentic Roman name, it is symbolic: I narrowed its translation to either a literal ""Five Days"" or the much more humorous, symbolic ""Days [are] Numbered"". An even funnier way to read it is ""How Many Days"" and I jazzume that should end with a question mark. Yep. ""Quintus Dias"" does it to me every time.Here, north of Hadrian's then new wall, Dias and only a few others survive horrific, gore laced battles with the Picts (who amazingly speak modern Irish Gaelic, right down to the Anglicized mispronunciations, instead of speaking Pictish, which language is a mystery to us anyway).I began laughing as they were haunted and hunted by a vicious, supernatural Pictish woman called Etaine (wrongly credited as ""Etain"", a Goth makeup nightmare by the name of Olga Kurylenko). Those ladies were tough fighters but they weren't like this. This lady mows down Romans as if they were Legos.There isn't much for me to add to this. There are just too many other films running along these lines, such as the equally ghastlyKing Arthur(2004, see my review),300(2006), the excellent family filmThe Last Legion(2007, see my review) and the equally excellent and underratedThe Eagle(2011, see my review). Of these, THE EAGLE and THE LAST LEGION are by far the finest.I was very impressed by the beautiful Imogen Poots who plays Arianne, the outcaste Pictish witch. Actually she is a healer who got the bad end of the stick   much like Dias will discover he's getting from the Empire after he gets back home. Though here agin a major stumble, since she is altogether far too reminiscent of Sam Neill inMerlin (Special Edition)(see my review).One thing I can say I am heartily sick of seeing is the set of common refrains running through these films (I back down from 300 because I have no time for a film like that): you can always count on stupid anachronisms galore, phony Celtic peoples (""Hey, why not make 'em all Irish?""), a Roman on a stupid quest, other colorful foreigners fighting with the Roman on his stupid quest, badly spoken Gaelic or Gobbledygook, Ice Age weather, very bad history overall, vast oceans of blood, violent battles that go on too long and finally, Romans deciding Britain is the pure land and defecting from the Empire.Oh, and let us not forget Hadrian's Wall, which is a bit like the obligatory pratfall in every comedy. It is poetic, a little bit of it is occasionally true   for the most part it is a repetitive bore to see that stuff repeated ad nauseam. Hey! Maybe they should have named Fjazzbender's Roman soldier Ad Nauseam. Better than Your Days Are Numbered.My recommendation is you watch the other films I mentioned before you see this one. You may find once you've seen a bit of it that you don't want to waste your time watching regurgitations. Then again, you just might develop a bit of a soft spot in your heart for this thing, as I did.It was the really good Roman era Arthurian film (THE LAST LEGION) and the stunning quasi gay Roman plus Celt love story (THE EAGLE) that created that soft spot.

"Zombie Strippers (2008) is a horror comedy that as you might guess from the title, involves a number of women working as strippers who are transformed into zombies.  Reality is pretty much off the table early, as besides taking a few shots at George W. Bush, featuring half naked women getting violent, spilling blood, and engaging in some outrageous acts, is the main point of the film.Sometime in the future, a private company working with the government has developed a Chemo virus that re animates the dead, and turns them into relentless fighting machines.  A soldier infected by this formula while on a mission, winds up at a strip club where he attacks a dancer named Kat (Jenna Jameson), turning Rhino gentlemen's club's star attraction into a zombie, who covered in blood, becomes an even more popular performer.Club owner Ian Essko (Robert Englund) sees his staff of strippers gradually being transformed into infected homicidal zombies who murder his clientele, however he isn't too concerned, since profits are way up.  The talent includes Gaia (Whitney Anderson), Lilith (Roxy Saint), and an innocent newbie named Jessy (Jennifer Holland), a Christian fresh off the farm, seeking to earn enough cash to pay for an operation for her grandmother.  When the zombified clientele gets loose, Essko arms his staff.  Eventually the army gets on the trail, and raids the establishment with chaotic results, as the violence reaches extreme levels, featuring outrageous gore, and some pretty radical special effects.Zombie Strippers features cartoonish violence, gory kills, lots of blood, crushed skulls, and half naked zombies engaging in some radical dance numbers, in between infecting the club's mesmerized patrons.  The zombie makeup gets more extreme as Jenna Jameson and Whitney Anderson evolve into rival creatures who do battle on the dance stage.  Jameson's character even goes on the attack with vaginal launched projectiles.For zombie fans that are also Prime members, Dead Snow (2009), Brain Dead (2007), and Aaah!

"This program speaks about the flaws of the dental system. I think people who liked Michael Moore's doc on the health care industry will enjoy this.One million ER visits are from people with teeth problems who can't afford dentists. In some states Medicare only pays 20% of the costs of dental care. This program focuses on children with pressing dental needs then moves on toward adults. The work says some companies pay dentists per visit, so those dentists may rush patients out rather than focusing on curing them. Some providers encourage people to get pricey everything & the kitchen sink work, rather than just what they really need. Some people can buy a dental care credit card, but those can have interest rates of 29%. Basically, people are having to choose between dental care vs. housing, cars, childcare, etc. Naturally folk chose those later options over dental care and their mouths pay for that decision. The industry could try an equivalent to nurse practitioners, but (greedy?) dentists and dental companies fight that move.More conservative viewers may be upset about issues not presented. This work never asks how meth addicts with their ""meth mouths"" tax the industry. This work never ties the obesity epidemic or the sugary snacks advertised to children as being culprits of the problem. A Canadian dentist once told me that even while Canada has universal health care, the coverage doesn't include braces which are seen as aesthetic. However, I would argue that we people with yuckmouths are psychologically traumatized by responses to our aesthetically unpleasing teeth and so it should be seen as necessary.

"And yet another television series about the legal profession.  The legal firm in question is a small partnership whose practice is exclusive to rich and powerful corporations or CEOs with the exception of the mandatory pro bono work. The ""twist"" is that one of the jazzociates pjazzed the bar without attending any law school, much less Harvard Law. The scripts are run of the mill, but Gabriel Macht, and the actress who plays the head of the firm have enough magnetism to rise above the scripts.  Second lead, the young jazzociate sans formal legal training is pleasant but IMHO lacks chops. The ""villin"" of the show, the attorney responsible for the care and feeding of new jazzociates is ""Dishonest John"" without the mustache.

"This movie is a simple zombedy flick that is fun, but you can't take it seriously.  It does feature actress from 'being human' and one from 'primeval new world' as well. They both do a good job as you would expect. The male leads are newbies and they are good as well. Steven Hchattie , the old pro actor  is in this and he plays a angry zombie hunter who is completely out of his gourd.  This is not a real zombie flick of course , but a zombedy , in which a man is bitten by a zombie misquito , and he becomes a brain loving zombie. Like all zombedies the violence is bad but done in a tongue in cheek way. Shotgun blasts leave nice round holes etc in heads and such. The movie is silly , and does feature nudity and a swollen brain like penis shot. But the main focus here is on comedy and it is mildly funny for sure.  The action is mainly taking place at a nice retreat cottage , and that's ok for a low budgeter like this one. However this is NOT a c movie , which are made by non pros with no experience, this is a professional film done by veterans on a low budget. The effects are good in this flick as well. This is similar to many other silly horror comedies , in which the monster is sympathetic and people around him , still try to treat him like the man he was. It looks better in hd and there is a blu ray of this out there.","silly zombedy , that is fun..",1376697600,"08 17, 2013",3,0
"The lesser scene involved a man who beat up another man supposedly because the second man did wrong by his brother.  If I understand the scenario correctly, one man was East Asian and the other Pacific Islander.  Politically, the groups are lumped together as ""API.""  However, this may be an actual sign of interethnic tensions.  The Asian guy has a white girlfriend and luckily the interracial coupling is never presented as problematic.Now onto the zebra.  It's not everyday that one sees a zebra in the US outside of a zoo.  This does show the wide vareity of issues a cop must address, but this was not a crime.  As I watched it, I kept saying, ""I hope the zebra's owner has to pay for all this.""  There are rules about owning wild animals and I don't think the taxpayers should have to shoulder that bill.  Later, they get the zebra inside a horse buggie, but the buggie already has a ""typical"" horse in it.  None of the cops mention it, but I was thinking, ""If the zebra and horse are of the opposite sex, one of them could give birth to a zorse or a hebra after this setup!""

"A team of parapsychologists led by Dr. Helzer (Michael O'Keefe) is hired by Alan White (Kai Lennox), father of two children Catlin (Gia Mantegna) and Benny (Damian Roman). The father, who recently lost his wife, wants the team to investigate strange events that have been annoying him and his children. To do so, the team's technical expert Paul Ortega (Rick Gonzalez) and ""gatekeeper"" Ellen (Fiona Glascott) set up cameras in the apartment rooms that may be haunted.It is unfortunate that ""Apartment 143"" (""Emergo"") had to be released after the commercial success of ""Paranormal Activity"". The stories are different, to be sure, but each film employs a similar approach to the subject matter. Visually and technically the Spanish film is superb, but devices such as videotaped footage and handheld cameras are no longer refreshing.Don't get me wrong. Slick and fast paced, ""Apartment 143"" is not boring, and the film provides some good scares. Some characters are interesting, Michael O'Keefe's super rational doctor, for instance. Carles Torrens (marking his feature debut as director) knows how to scare audiences. Some of the scenes are really scary, effectively tense and creepy.One of the unique aspects of ""Apartment 143"" (written by Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s, director of ""Buried"" starring Ryan Reynolds) is its script that attempts to scientifically explain the supernatural occurrences that haunt the family. It is a nice idea, but the theories and reasoning presented in the film just don't convince.Had the film been released ten years earlier, ""Apartment 143"" would have received more positive reactions. As it is, the film looks familiar and even clich&eacute;d, in spite of s few pretty good scares.","Paranormal Activity Scientifically Explored: Decent with a Few Nice Scares, But Not Special",1353196800,"11 18, 2012",3,0
"If you want to see a historically accurate film about the eruption of the Vesuvius in 79 AD that destroyed Pompeii, then this is not the movie for you. If instead you want to see an entertaining sword and sandals picture, well, then you might enjoy this movie. Milo (Kit Harrington) is a Celtic warrior imprisoned by the Romans during the Invasion of Britain and turned into a slave. Having seen all his family killed by the invading Romans, he is thirsty for revenge. Slated to fight as a gladiator in Pompeii just before the explosion of the volcano, the unexpected events might make his dreams come true.This movie looks like an extended, lesser chapter of the TV series Spartacus. Kiefer Sutherland is a very good villain as a nasty power hungry Roman senator. Unfortunately, not the same can be said of the uncharismatic actor portraying Milo, the Orlando Bloom look alike Kit Harrington. His love interest, the Roman Cjazzia, played by Emily Browning, does not impress much. But Adewale Agbaje does a fine impression as Atticus, the African gladiator that becomes Milo's ally (this character clearly mirrors Doctore in Spartacus, that was played by Peter Mensah).The fight scenes are fine, and so is the volcano explosion (though the use of computer imagery is a bit obvious at times).

"First off, in my own opinion, this wasn't quite as good as something like The Warrior's Way. What got my attention about this film was its primary theme of rebelling against tyranny  especially unstable tyranny. And a small group of people (normally, it's misfits, in this case it's samurai becoming jazzjazzins) that go out of their way to bring said tyrant down. For this first half of this film, it felt pretty slow with only a couple of action scenes that felt a bit too quick, though I guess I can let it slide with the disturbing image of a young woman with limbs severed off (I got to hand it to him, Takashi refuses to follow any cinematic rules, and this film furthers his stuff). The meatier violence, sadly, is closer to the end, just in the second half of the flick. And, just like in movie Detective Story, there's a shocking image of a nude boy... though he actually takes a leak, getting a lead samurai to smile in incredulity of the simplicity of small village life. But when the action does start, it's heavy hitting, nonstop, and completely jaw dropping. Out of all the jazzjazzins, I'm inclined to like the last added one since he's quite the riot with his clumsiness and big mouth. The very last action scene seemed to also have the best philosophy in the movie, since it deals with the integrity and diginity of all man, including one's own enemy and reveals the total nonchalance and inhumanity of the main enemy in the film. When all's said and done, I couldn't help but smile at the conversation that goes on that ends this film.","Almost had it, Mr. Takashi",1344902400,"08 14, 2012",3,0

Eva's looks and on screen personality exude tough competent cop to a Tee and she does a very good and realistic job playing lead detective Wern.

The cinematography ( aerial, towns and cities, seascapes and landscapes)  alone are worth the time to watch this show.  The writing is solid with interesting stories and good dialogue, but they do lack some details that hinder the stories somewhat . The show does have some violent scenes (as expected for a cop show) , but nothing to graphic and the murder scenes can sometimes be pretty graphic, but again not as bad as many other shows of this genre. The dialogue contains at times cursing and in the last few episodes they even contain the f&#8230;word here and there. There is no graphic nudity or sex scenes, but some lovemaking scenes that are really tame and cut away before things get going.This is a must see cop show that does touch on the realities of cause and effect on the people who enforce the law.

"This is obviously a minority opinion here, but I was not especially high on Season One of THE BIG BANG THEORY.  I first have to confess that sitcoms are my dead bottom least favorite genre of show.  I barely make room for HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER, but all in all it is a format that I find pretty dreadful, on the same level of reality and talent shows and crime procedurals.  I hate the limitations of the camera work, the lack of character development, and    the worst invention in the history of television    the laugh track.

Much of it was that they hadn't sufficiently found ways to soften Sheldon's character, who can at times be very funny but at other times    especially in this season    be excruciatingly irritating.Season Two saw a number of subtle alterations of the show, mainly softening Sheldon, but also increasing the dynamics between the various characters.  But Season One felt slightly off to me.  I can't help but contrast it somewhat with HOW I MET YOUR MOTHER.  The latter almost acknowledges the limitations of the format and constantly stretches it, including a pretty large number of exterior shots on the Warner Brothers lot.  The show also uses their laugh track much more lightly than TBBT.  Both shows suffer from too small of a cast (a common problem with sitcoms).  The  best comedies are not sitcoms, don't have laugh tracks, are not restricted to sound stages, and have large ensemble casts (cf. MODERN FAMILY, 30 ROCK, ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT, PARTY DOWN, early SCRUBS, and THE OFFICE).On the other hand, it is fun seeing a show with lots of nerd references.  Plus, I've actually known a couple of people who were geniuses along the line of Sheldon (though I should say that perhaps my greatest nerd moment was that when I worked in the University of Chicago Bookstore    before it became a Barnes & Noble    Chandrasekhar would always do a beeline to me to get help finding books [hey, having a world cljazz genius    another Nobel Prize winning physicist told me that in his opinion Chandrasekhar would rank as one of the two great twentieth century physicists after Einstein    acknowledge your competence on books, even as a lowly book clerk, and nod to you as you walk across the campus may be a faint form of achievement, but if you don't understand this you don't understand the guys on TBBT]).  And as a comic book lover it is fun seeing a show with a lot of references to comics (though they seem to be limited entirely to superhero comics, while that makes up only part of my interest in comics).  But all of this was not quite enough to overcome the sitcom limitations, the laugh track, and irritating way that Sheldon was written in Season One.  The good news is that Season Two represented a huge improvement.  It still isn't among my favorite shows (no sitcom ever could be), but it is one that I will continue to DVR after having caught up on DVD.",Not nearly as good as Season Two would be,1264896000,"01 31, 2010",3,0

I thought it was a fun idea to use the troll concept, but the idea was wasted.

"&lt;strong>The Shrine&lt; strong> (Jon Knautz, 2010)&lt;em>The Shrine&lt; em>, the second feature from &lt;em>Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer&lt; em> director Knautz, was actually a lot better than I thought it would be; after all, it came from the guy who gave the world &lt;em>Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer&lt; em>. Which is not to say it's a mind numbingly great movie, but as far as being a run of the mill supernatural horror flick set in Eastern Europe, it holds its own well enough.Plot: three investigative journalists (&lt;em>Smallville&lt; em>'s Aaron Ashmore, &lt;em>Supernatural&lt; em>'s Cindy Sampson, and &lt;em>Chloe&lt; em>'s Meghan Heffern) travel deep into the Eastern European countryside to substantiate claims of a human sacrifice in a remote village. When they get there, they find things are a bit more complicated than that  but that may not stop them from becoming the next victims.It's actually a pretty fun little movie, with a decent effects budget (that was well used) and a script that aimed at turning a lot of horror movie clich&eacute;s on their collective head. One more rewrite to come up with inventive ways around a few nasty plot holes would have been a good thing, and I wasn't terribly convinced by a lot of the acting; this is what happens when you try to lure teen audiences by pulling from CW shows. Still, horror aficionados who are sick of the same old thing may want to give this one a whistle, because even if it's predictable, it's at least going to take the predictability into the opposite side of the playground each time it can. ***",A pleasant surprise.,1335484800,"04 27, 2012",3,0
"Although it remains rather thin, the plot thickens during episode 6 by way of a flashback to Ingrid's sordid past and a glimpse of things to come when another character's true identity is revealed to the viewer. The pilot didn't leave me with a burning desire to keep watching, but I'm glad I did. While the show has much room for improvement, there are definite strengths here, most notably the cast (with one exception). The choice of Julia Ormond as Joanna Beauchamp is only slightly bested by the pick of M&auml;dchen Amick as the black cat of the family, Wendy Beauchamp. As for the daughters: Rachel Boston is convincing as Ingrid Beauchamp, but Jenna Dewan, despite being absolutely radiant on screen, does not to me seem like a good fit for the show as Freya Beauchamp.The magick should be compelling by today's television standards, and indeed sometimes it is; other times, however, it more resembles parlour tricks, and occasionally is reminiscent of Bewitched from 1964. I'm still trying to figure out who the target demographic is for Witches of East End. It's brimming with soapy drama to potentially draw in the crowd who normally wouldn't watch a show in this genre, but it also maintains just enough of a morbid edge for viewers like me. In this sense, it is no better or worse than a serial like The Vampire Diaries.UPDATE &lt;Dec.2013> SEASON FINALE ... The final episode of the premier season goes about it the right way: ending a major plot line while at the same time providing a premonition of things to come. It remains a 3 star show; proficient enough to keep you coming back, but falling well short of providing episodes that blow you away. The introduction of Joel Gretsch as WitchDaddy (my term, not theirs) late in the season was a wise choice, as the actor brings credibility and potentially some fans (The 4400: The Complete Series). I'd like him to continue as a recurring character, and I'd like to see production of more than just the next season of WoEE (a second season of 13 episodes has been confirmed by Lifetime).","Soapy, but now with Joel Gretsch",1384300800,"11 13, 2013",3,0

"The idea of murdering children on a rampage is certainly not a new one.  There have been countless film projects to address the phenomenon in both horror and science fiction categories.  But it is such an unsettling narrative device, it never fails to raise my curiosity.  As the ultimate corruption of innocence, the sight of a young child ready to perpetuate irredeemable violence creates such a harrowing tableau that it is oftentimes difficult to look away.  It has a car crash appeal that I find absolutely fascinating.  The minimalist shocker ""Come Out and Play"" has a slow build tension that makes the most of its subject.  For much of its scant 86 minute running time, it alludes to dangers unseen as opposed to showcasing carnage.  This approach does create a creepy vibe, but it also calls for the adult cast to make a series of increasingly head scratching decisions in order to sustain the tension.  In a film of this type, I feel the need to get caught up in the escalating nightmare with the protagonists.  Here, however, I was kept at a distance by their poor choices and was glad my survival didn't depend on their combined brain power!Vinessa Shaw and Ebon Moss Bachrach play a young married couple vacationing in Mexico.  Shaw is quite pregnant and probably should be getting some rest, but she seems up for an adventure. They contract a motor boat to take an excursion to a more isolated locale.  Upon arriving at a picturesque little village on a tranquil island, they are greeted by a gaggle of playing children.  What fun!  As they head into town, however, it seems like they missed the action.  Not a person is to found on the streets or in ANY establishment (aside for an occasionally creepy child).  They are nothing, though, if not persistent.  After stopping for a snack in an abandoned bar, picking up supplies from an abandoned store, and arriving at their abandoned hotel  nothing seems capable of deterring them from this magical vacation.  I, myself, would have headed right back to my boat at some point in this exploration.  Heck, I might not have survived, but I wouldn't have prolonged the experience pretending everything was fine!  Pretty soon, it becomes apparent that something is amiss.  The movie explains what happened to a small degree, but not so that it makes particular sense.  But that's not so important.  Now we have to worry about escaping unscathed.Shaw and Moss Bachrach are likable enough, and that certainly helps.  If anything, though, they don't display much instinct for survival.  Despite clear evidence as to what is happening, they remain surprisingly non violent for most of the picture.  The best segments come in the final third of the movie.  The movie's single most effective scene takes place in a locked jail cell.  It may come as a surprise to some, but the harrowing moment was set up and should be expected by anyone with an eye for this type of horror.  Even though I knew it was coming, it still worked quite well.  From this point, the film finally embraces its essence.  When the mayhem reaches a crescendo (and it does so only in the last few minutes), the picture is beautifully grandiose and over the top.  And I loved the commitment of these final gonzo confrontations.  After a flimsy beginning, it does pay off.  For the record, I didn't mind the slow build tension of the piece.  I'll wait for the action, I just wanted to be able to identify with the choices the characters were making.  And that was sometimes difficult (for example, I'd have been scouring the island for vehicles and or boats and it never occurs to the leads unless they stumble upon one).  ""Come Out and Play"" is still worth a look if you like this genre.  About 3 1 2 stars.

"The Eclipse tells the story of Michael, a recent widower, as he begins to have disturbing visions of his nearly dead father in law. He shares his experiences with Lena, an author of supernatural stories. The Eclipse is a haunting supernatural drama.First, this is a drama with horror elements more than it is a pure horror film, so you should adjust your expectations if you were thinking differently. The story is, however, very creepy and haunting as it takes a more realistic approach in telling this ghost story. There are a few shocking jump scares, but only a few. The film really tries to connect several characters and subplots, but that missed its point and hurts the film. In fact, I felt the story lacked direction and impact so some aspects were forgettable. The performances were good, nothing spectacular and nothing terrible   I think the cast was well fitted for their roles. The music was excellent, eerily enchanting and often mesmerizing.Overall, The Eclipse has some decent horror drama elements and a haunting soundtrack, but fails to leave an impact and is ultimately forgettable. As of 5 20 13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a rental is recommended.The Eclipse has some violence and blood.

"""Centurion"" is what is called a ""hack and slash"" film from Neil Marshall, director of ""Dog Soldiers"" and ""The Descent,"" which means there are lots of gores, mutilated limbs and dead bodies. Blending raw violence and beautiful landscapes, ""Centurion"" has a potential for a sweeping saga with action, history and romance, but somehow the film itself, though it is not bad, ends up with dissatisfaction because of the generic storytelling and flat characters.Set in the second century Britain, a band of Roman soldiers is left behind the enemy lines after the surprise attack from the Pictish warriors. Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fjazzbender), who had survived the Pictish raid on the Roman frontier fort, is entrusted by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West) of the Ninth Legion with the task of bringing the six survivors back to safety.Michael Fjazzbender is as brilliant as ever though his heroic character (and the romantic subplot) is underwritten. Olga Kurylenko appears as a fearsome warrior riding on a horse (and she doesn't speak a single word). She is not bad, but those who expect her to play another sexy ""Bond Girl"" as in ""Quantum of Solace"" might be disappointed.For me, the biggest problem with the film is that though ""Centurion"" delivers a few thrilling action scenes, the story itself is not that thrilling. We see a group of characters chased by another group of characters, but the chase scenes drag on, are at times repetitious, sometimes even look as if borrowed from somewhere else, like ""Butch Cjazzidy and the Sundance Kid.""""Centurion"" is a blood soaked period action that could have been better with fleshed out characters and a tighter story.",Could Have Been Better with a Tighter Storyline,1295913600,"01 25, 2011",3,0

"Blue Oyster Cult was is a Long Island rock band that peaked in the mid 70's with the cljazzic ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper."" In this indi drama, Ron Eldard (""Super 8"") plays Jimmy, a roadie on their tour for the past 20 some years.  For reasons unexplained, he is fired, by telephone no less.  With no job, no money and no prospects he decides to go to the house where he grew up in Queens, N. Y.  His mother (veteran actress Lois Smith), hardly recognizes him.  Except for one day when his father died, Jimmy hadn't been back since he first left home and went on tour.While sipping a cocktail at a local saloon, Jimmy runs into an old high school nemisis (Bobby Cannavale) and his wife and Jimmy's former girlfriend (Jill Hennessy).  Nikki (Hennessy) is a struggling solo artist, but seems happy in her life which includes singing before 30 or 40 people.  We can pretty much see where this is all heading but, it really doesn't.  Although Nikki does stop by Jimmy's house and visits his old bedroom which his mother had kept intact (complete with vinyl albums and a working turntable), their high school memories are just that.There really isn't much of a story here.  The actors do their part well, but they don't have much to work with.  Although a night out with plenty of booze and cocaine produces an opportunity to let loose, the story peters out the next day.

"Let me say before I talk about the episode that the commercials at the beginning of my paid for episode really piss me off. Let me explain the concept to Amazon's 1980's Reaganomics based marketing department in case they've forgotten. I paid for a movie, TV show, etc. so that I don't have to watch advertising. Advertising is supposed to be what you put in to compensate yourselves for giving away media for free, not when we overpay for each episode. If you want to give me this for free, or even as part of a Prime membership, I'll be happy to watch a commercial or two.Anyway, the production quality of the episode is excellent, with that said there is no end in site for this series and the plot lines are just being drug out shamelessly. Basically here's the outline. SAMCRO did bad stuff in their past, before Jax, then he did bad stuff for the ""right reasons"" in his time, now his decisions come back to haunt him, the club, and everyone around him, but he really just wants to get the club back ""on track"" with his father's vision... blah, blah, blah.

"This show has so much going for it from a production value perspective that ranges from the acting, direction, editing, locations, stories and visual effects with camera work to the unique ways its victims are killed.The cast does a fantastic job of telling each and every story they are a part of and bringing the viewer along with them. The directors skill at guiding the cast to tell each episodes story is also quite evident in this series.What hurts this series for me is the ludicrous and far fetched way they portray Fishburne's (Crawford) and Dancy's (Graham) characters as well as Milkkelsen's (Lecter) to the point of absurdity. I will give a few examples to make my case. Graham is not an official FBI agent and yet he is allowed to carry a firearm? Also, he is unstable and has a history of this which would bar him from legally possessing a firearm? Crawford is the director of the special unit of the FBI and would not be taking direct part in busts nor would he allow Graham to be involved in these cases with his mental health issues. The director (FBI section director) would never expose these cases to legal scrutiny by using Graham in the investigations nor expose the department to lawsuits because of Graham using a firearm. These are but a few of the many over the top (OTT) problems that detract from an otherwise great show. I guess the further from the truth the better for ratings similar to how reality shows are as real as our politicians being honest and working for ""We The People""Another issue is whether this series is about Graham or Lecter because it seems more time has been spent on Graham's character and less on Lecter's the entire first season. We know what Lecter has been up to so it is somewhat understandable to see why so much time has been devoted to Graham, but again is this the best way to go? Lecter is a complex character and I think needs more time to develop his persona and less time on Graham's character.This version seems to follow The Hannibal Rising theme more closely than Silence of The Lambs with Hopkins and his English accent Vs. Mikkelsen's Dutch using a German accent. I must say it took me awhile to adjust to the German accent, but after watching Hannibal Rising it follows the character in a truer form than Lambs did and makes more sense.This is only true with the prequel story to the Silence story from watching the movies and not reading the series of books.This is a decent show and well worth the time to watch, but is to far out there to rate above 3 stars.",DISNEY MEETS HANNIBAL LECTER,1393459200,"02 27, 2014",3,0

"I took a chance and watched this film late one night mostly because I am a fan of Sarah Polley both as a director and actress but I felt the writing was juvenile, the story simplistic, and the directing mediocre. She had all the right ingredients to make a wonderful film but nothing really meshed. The story was fairly simple.  Michelle Williams played a young woman who meets Luke Kirby on a trip to Louisbourg, Nova Scotia.  They end up in the same plane home to Toronto and then find out they live across the street from one another.  Sounds like the beginning of a beautiful love story but oops, sorry, Michelle's character Margot is already married to Lou, played by Seth Rogan, and expresses that she is still in love with him. Unfortunetly she is very intrigued by Daniel, (Luke Kirby), and thus begins the basis for the entire film; whether she should stay with Lou, who is nice and sweet and safe or try something different and start a relationship with Daniel.  The worst part, for me, was the lack of chemistry between Michelle Williams and her husband as well as her potential lover. I found Luke Kirby very sexy and I just kept wondering what does he see in this childish, neurotic, simplistic young woman other than her looks. She was so needy in a very agitated way that it made me very uncomfortable. I thought Seth Rogan did a suprisingly good job in a role outside his usual comedic genre and Luke Kirby could have been much better if he had been given a better muse and better, more unique dialogue. SPOILER! I found the scene in the cafe where he tells Margot what he would physically like to do to her almost embarjazzing because it was like he was professing his love and lust to child and not a sexy woman. It is frustrating when a film that has so much potential leaves you so disappointed. I want to give it lower ratings but I gave it 3 stars because I could see there was alot of effort by Polley and the cast but, in the end, it just didn't work for me.",A disappointment by director Polley,1360108800,"02 6, 2013",3,0

"Note: I have seen every episode of this show in HD via XFinity On Demand.WARNING: CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!!!After a fantastic debut season, minus the disgusting and unneccessary gay romances, could SMASH maintain the momentum and story for season II? Well, it's no fault of the actors and writers. They certainly tried their hardest, and for the most part, it worked very well. The episodes were finely structured, and the characters more than two dimensioned. Some traits, however, came completely out of left field and were entirely unneccessary, both from a creative and dramatic standpoint. Example: It was so never hinted at that Kyle was gay until he's seen kissing a guy in a bar, who shortly thereafter breaks up with him because he sodomised another man, and the scenes of guys kissing each other, and being in bed next to each other were totally unneccessary, as they added NOTHING to the plot, and above all, they're immoral, both socially, and Biblically. The Bible saith, ""Thou shalt not lie with a man as one lieth with a woman; it is abomination."" The show could have succeeded without that garbage in it. However, that is the only fly in the ointment of what was otherwise a spectacular television series. Kyle was a sympathetic character, and I think he & Karen would have been a perfect couple, had things not worked out with Derek & Karen.I was very disappointed with how the show ended things, in terms of relationships. Karen & Derek should have ended up together, Jimmy should have died, along with Sam (good idea to excise him for a number of episodes; shame that it wasn't permanent, though). Tom also should have gotten a girlfriend, and stayed with her. The drama with Daisy should have been explored more (I would loved to have seen the coup the dancers did against her, and the confrontation between her and Jerry when Derek tells her that there's been a change of plan. Season I had a lot of great songs. Season II, though, not so much. The quality of the storylines were still strong, minus the gay b.s., but the overall quality of good songs just seemed to drop drastically, though there were some good ones. So, in regard to the male male gay stuff aspect of the show, SAYONARA, PIGS!!! Good luck finding another mudhole. Katharine McPhee, Jack Davenport, Debra Messing and Anjelica Huston were really good in this show, and Ms. McPhee has a big future ahead of her.Rated TV 14 (gay people kissing & in bed, moderate profanity).","Bittersweet Finale To A Great Show.

"I didn't know if this film would be awful or not.  Turns out it's in the horror parody genre, most reminiscent of ""Return of the Living Dead"" (the first one, not #2 or #3) which was an amazingly enjoyable film to watch.  A couple decades later, this film has similarities in its tone and in the sheer fun it has with the zombie genre.  It definitely pays homage to scenes from a number of previous zombie films.  It has a linear plot: virus in a secret govt. research facility escapes, infecting strippers in an off site illegal strip club, and things go from bad to worse.  However it has a decidedly comedic tone to the entire film.  It used as a source material a French play about ""The Rhinoceros"" (a gentleman's nightclub), hence all the references to French and European existentialist philosophers, writers etc.  In what other film would you get a stripper quoting Nietzche, or a spec ops guy named Camus?  It also pokes fun (repeatedly) at the George W. Bush administration be forewarned  and it deliberately overplays stereotypes like the ""crack special forces"", the for profit corporate contractors, the East European Madame, the greedy but inept nightclub owner,and so on.  It's not really very scary, but there's quite a bit of blood and special effects depicting violence at times.  And the ""stripper"" actresses are quite good.  They do make some beautiful stripper  dancers.  There is female nudity in the film.There are a few holes in the plot but it's all meant to be fun, so you can't take the plot all that seriously anyhow.Bonuses to the DVD include a whole bunch of trailers for other films, quite a few cut scenes (some pretty interesting), commentary filmtrack, and two fairly short clips on the making of the film.

"If I rated each episode individually it would be:Waters of mars   5 stars  By far the best writing of all the episodes in the specials.Planet of the dead  2 stars (although I will say that the black actor who plays the female general is absolutely superb in her performance.  Anyone know her name?)The end of time (both parts as one episode)  3 stars.  This isn't as straight forward to rate because it has some parts that are great but for a large part they really weren't written that well.  The guy playing Donna's dad did wonderfully in his performance as always. I really love the master as a character for various reasons  just like the doctor he carries in him much pain and much joy as well (even though that joy is often from inflicting pain on others).  The defeat of the master in a previous episode was much more heartbreaking and dramatic as we saw The doctor suffer right in front of us when he once again became the last time lord.  This time it wasn't nearly as heart wrenching.  Also the saying goodbye of our beloved time lord was so drawn out (it basically started at Planet of the dead and in this episode he reminds us of the premonition every 10 minutes) that it became melodramatic.  Although the last words ""I don't want to go."" were beautiful and very realistic.

"Director Terrence Malick is most certainly an acquired taste, but one I acquired early with ""Badlands"" (1973) and last saw in the remarkable ""The Tree of Life"" (2011).  It's pretty rare that he follows up so quickly given his record (10 films total).  Maybe that is the problem with this film.  And make no mistake, it's a problem.  ""To The Wonder"" certainly isn't a terrible movie.  Mallick's use of the outdoor landscape resonates throughout the film.  Set in Oklahoma, he edits quickly between everyday scenes.  A setting sun, a flower, an insect.  The film is sparse of dialog.Neil (Ben Afflick) has fewer lines than you can count on your fingers and toes.  He has a romantic affair in Paris with young Marina (Olga Kurylenko, ""Oblivion"").  She has young daughter, having been abandon by her husband.  Neil agrees reluctantly to bring her to America where they are to be married and she can get her Green Card.  Neil works for the state or federal EPA and is seen taking soil and water samples throughout the film.  Why?  Dunno.As he becomes more distant emotionally, Marina and daughter will return to France, but eventually return.  In the meantime, Neil rekindles a relationship with Jane (Rachel McAdams, ""Midnight In Paris"").  When she starts a discussion about marriage, Neil retreats again.  Hey, the guy doesn't want to get married!While all this is going on, Father Quintana (Javier Bardem, ""Skyfall"") is having his own mental issues.  Is he doing all he can do for humanity?  Should he even be a priest?  He eventually becomes a confidant to Marina, when she returns.  Marina and Neil reunite, but their bickering and emotional struggles increase to the point of being violent.  Is anything resolved?  Love isn't always perfect.  As I look back at Malick's films, this one is certainly his least impressive but perhaps most personal.In spite of my reservations about the film, there is nothing not to like about the Blu ray transfer.  Shot using 35mm and 65mm cameras, it all comes across beautifully in the 1080p picture and with a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The grey and brown starkness of rural Oklahoma comes across with excellent color and hue.  The contrast is spot on and the detail is excellent.  Malick's films always have great soundtracks and this one is no different.  Using DTS HD Master Audio 5.1.  There are numerous outdoor shots with staging in Paris and Oklahoma and the range from street noise to whistling wind come through the speakers loud and clear.  I'm not sure why, but I had to raise the volume level a couple notches over my usual setting.  Subtitles come in Spanish and English SDH.

"OK, this one is kind of over the top. Jack Bauer comes back from Chinese captivity a broken man. Then he is confronted with a series of terrorist attacks culminating in the explosion of an atomic bomb. The show also has turned somehow more gruesome since we early on see Jack bite the neck and kill one of his captors (Jack as vampire?)  and then eventually he will kill one of his friends and torture his brother. His father also turns out to be an enemy. And we get to know this pretty early on in the series. While the performance of Jack Bauer as burned out is particularly well done at the same time it is distracting and the show suffers from his lack of motivation. There is also an unnecessary emphasis on a multitude of subplots which tend to cause more of a headache and do not contribute to the storyline. That said it is not bad, it is simply not as good as season 5.

"Exceptional thrillers have a great way of taking control of an audience's ability to generate its own adrenaline and then hit the gas pedal.  The Fox TV series ""24"" did this to very solid acclaim through most of its run on the small screen, and films like DIE HARD and even the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy make use of the popular `race against time' formula.  The ticking clock scenario also presents actors with a unique challenge to take the viewers along with them for the wild ride, knowing that every second counts when any timepiece is winding down to `zero.'For all of its merits (and there are plenty, including a solid central performance by Stephen Dorff), BRAKE comes off as more than just a bit convoluted.  The story?  Jeremy Raines (Dorff), a secret service agent, wakes up trapped inside a sealed gljazz box located inside the trunk of a vehicle.  He has absolutely no idea of how he got there   the script only provides a few hints as to his activities beyond the events of this film (sorry, folks, but I found that a BIG weakness).  However, the box is outfitted with a few attachments   an LED clock counting down, an air supply, a cell phone type device, an old CB radio   and he's soon informed by his captors that unless he'll divulge the physical address of `Roulette' that they'll kill him and his young wife.  What is `Roulette'?  It's the bunker location that would hold the President of the United States (POTUS) and the Vice President in the event of a terrorist attack.  Raines spends the next hour trapped inside the box while being subjected to all kinds of torture, all the while trying to make contact with the outside world to let them know that he's been caught and being held by suspected terrorists.It's a suspenseful tale that works as a thriller mostly because of Dorff's work.  In fact, most of the problems involve a script that lacks any real narrative center.  (It's difficult to discuss without spoiling the surprise ending, so I'll have to leave it at that.)  Suffice it to say that, as an agent, Dorff uses his smarts to try to affect an escape ... but he never uses his smarts well enough to deduce what's really going on here.  Part of that is because of the story taking place in the outside world   he's led to believe that there's a series of smaller attacks unfolding against Washington DC   but, were that the case, why weren't all of the folks he contacts through the CB radio equally as concerned?  There are a few other creative missteps that involve Raines' unique medical condition   certainly if the terrorists knew as much as they suggest they know about the agent's background   why would they have chosen one unique form of torture (you'll have to watch it to understand that point)?Still, BRAKE works as a thriller, and I tend to give it a pjazz on that level alone.  There's a nice dabbling of conspiracy backed with some interesting political developments in there to keep an audience's interest.  While it may not succeed on every level, it certainly presents a viscerally claustrophic thrill ride so long as you can endure it for 90 minutes.  It was fun to see how it all worked (or tried to work), and, despite a few flawed choices in the script, it delivers enough entertainment to be a solid guilty pleasure.  I'll probably never spin it in the DVD player again, but, as a one off flick?  I had enough fun with it to give it a confident three stars.BRAKE was produced by Walking West Entertainment and Costa Productions, La.  DVD distribution is being handled through the MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds exceptional; pay particularly close attention to the skillful layering of the audio track as some of the hints clues that are dropped happen so quickly they might escape your attention.  The disc comes with a making of featurette, a music video, and the theatrical trailer (though I'd encourage you to NOT watch the trailer before you watch the motion picture IF you prefer your films completely unspoiled as there are a few spoilers in there for the whiz bang twist of an ending).  It's an affable collection, nothing great, for a film that'll have limited audience appeal.RECOMMENDED.  While it may not enter the history books as the greatest film ever, BRAKE works as a serviceable thriller for a post 9 11 world.  Sure, some parts of it may seem very far fetched, but, like any good episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, it's the type of film that you'll watch differently if you spin it again.

It's taken a few years but he's back now and starring, co writing, and co directing and, yep, doing his own stunts in ONG BAK 2: THE BEGINNING. This is touted as a prequel toOng Bak   The Thai Warrior, except that I didn't see any direct link to that flick. Maybe the connection will be clarified in ONG BAK 3 (oh, it's coming.).The good news? These are straight up jawdropping, extremely violent fight scenes, and several are darn inventive. Tony Jaa incorporates various martial arts disciplines (Muay Thai, of course, but also a dash of kung fu, wing chun, and kenjutsu; dude even does a bit of drunken boxing). Jaa demonstrates a level of proficiency with several martial arts weapons like the sword, the rope dart, the triple staff and, I guess, the pachyderm. There's always a raw, visceral element in Jaa's fights, and  this is only exacerbated by the dirty, gritty period look of the film. As ever, the energy and athleticism shown on screen are staggeringly off the charts.The bad news? The narrative moves at a sloooow pace. Yeah, the stories in most martial arts films tend to lack in depth, instead serving as framing devices for the fight sequences. Tony Jaa strives for an epic historical action drama, but doesn't quite pull it off. ONG BAK 2's storyline is choppy and drags, and it's especially painful during the flashback segments. A possible romantic subplot is introduced but then doesn't go anywhere. And, holy crapcakes, there's that distressingly weak cliffhanger ending. Rumor has it that Tony Jaa went temporarily insane in the membrane during shooting and vanished into the wilds for a period of two months, which couldn't have been good for production. You'd have to think that the budget constraints and Jaa's directing debut had something to do with the film's faulty execution, storywise, and possibly with the decision to end on a shaky cliffhanger. But apparently ONG BAK 2 gathered in enough at the international box office that it paved the way for a third installment. The big hope now is that ONG BAK 3 does flesh out some of the half formed story arcs in this one. And I'm salivating at a rematch between Jaa and that black clad crow raven something birdy warrior.Is the lead character in ONG BAK 2 an ancestor of Ting, the protagonist of ONG BAK? We don't find out in this one. But we do find out that times were rough in medieval Thailand. The story takes places in the 15th Century, in the backdrop of ancient warring kingdoms, rampant jazzjazzinations, and traitorous vjazzals. The central character is Tien, an orphaned boy of privilege raised by the outlaws of Garuda Wing Cliff and rigorously trained in various forms of martial arts. Tien grows up and sets his sights on them what murdered his family. Bring on the grueling brawls but also the sluggish backstory.There's an almost mystical vibe just pulsating underneath, kicked off by a pretty farfetched scene in which Jaa forces a submission from the head bull elephant and thus inducing the other elephants to kneel in obeisance. And then there's the mysterious black clad crow figure. Later on, the ending rolls around with a dreary voiceover abruptly calling for us to unite the power of our minds and our faiths so that Tien may return. And, after the prayer sessions, the voiceover will pjazz a hat around.Tony Jaa's fight scene recipe is adhered to. No wires, no CGI, no stunt doubles, lots and lots of bruises. ONG BAK 2 comes hard with intense full contact fights, and this almost redeems the movie. Tony Jaa makes every brutal encounter feel like it's bitterly personal and he's taking out his grievances on sundry henchmen. I actually cringed when he abused one bad guy's Adam's apple. There's even two folks who throw down on an elephant, not to mention Jaa using the elephant as a fight prop. I will say, though, that the last fight didn't live up to expectation. Still, there's something satisfying about Jaa taking his lumps but still violently victimizing an army of ninja type goons. I've seen him do this before, take on a wave of foot soldiers, in ONG BAK and in TOM YUM GOONG (a.k.a.The Protector (Two Disc Collector's Edition)). It never friggin' gets old. So Jaa is holding it down with the fighty fights. But the screenplay writers   and I guess one of them is Tony Jaa   had better get their shizzy together. ONG BAK 2 is recommended for its rousing action sequences, condemned for its ponderous pacing. The acting is what you'd expect, with the villains over the top and not stinting on their villain laughs.Hey, Tony Jaa and Manny Pacquiao in a thumb war.

"this is an unromanticized view of marriage and I think if shown to young people it might likely turn them away from the institution. This is a great film to show to parents of daughters, on what not to do. Cutie and the Boxer are both interesting, attractive, flawed people who have spent (at the time of the filming) nearly 40 years together, making art, arguing, sometimes making love, drinking, raising a son (albeit shakily), and barely getting by financially. Twenty years her husband's junior, a young, naive and beautiful Cutie is enamored with her husband's art, and no fool, he slips into her bed through her love of his art. Eventually she becomes an artist herself, but she resents, dislikes and challenges many aspects of her husband's sexist jazzumptions, which basically say that as the artiste, and the husband, he is the dominant in their relationship and that she is there to facilitate him and his efforts. She chooses to stay with him for many reasons, perhaps mostly because she has few options (why she stays isn't answered squarely. there is some talk along the lines of opposites attracting and it also seems clear that she doesn't have her own money). I don't know if she had family willing to help her, apparently not. The Boxer sees and feels her resentment, and distances himself from her (""I never listen to you""), perhaps because he doesn't know how to make it better. He's sexist, but he's 80 years old and his attitudes make sense given his age. His world view only works though if he finds a woman willing to put up with his guff. And there lies the sadness. Cutie initially believes herself to be lesser than him, and at first accepts the Boxer's world view, only to spend the last 40 years trying to change the terms of their contract, with mixed results. When we raise girls to have low self esteem, they are more likely to settle for any guy who throws them a few compliments. Eventually they morph into bitter, unhappy, unfulfilled women. In the beginning of the film you see Cutie nitpicking at her husband, and that seems a very unpleasant way for a couple to live. As the story progresses, you learn why Cutie behaves the way she does (she is angry and feels her husband takes advantage of her and takes her for granted (she is an unpaid art jazzistant and chef, among other things. She is under appreciated: her husband cannot make his art without her direct physical help, so that makes her his artistic partner, in my opinion, though apparently not in his. We see her helping him jazzemble his art. He cannot jazzemble it by himself, so her aid is essential. We see Cutie's art, and the Boxer does not help her create it, so his jazzistance is not critical in the creation of her art). He needs her and relies on her, but he speaks of himself as the power player, and her as the lesser than. It's easy to understand her rage with his attitude. Only the people in a marriage know what their marriage really is (though the son here probably has a good idea), but from the outside it appears to be an uneasy truce of egos. To me their art is beautiful. Their marriage reminds me of a saying I heard long ago about sausage making: you really don't want to know what all goes into it. By the time Cutie speaks up and gets her art shown along side her husband's, I feel proud of her for insisting her art has value, and by extension, that she herself has value. With her exhibition, I noticed that she was snipping alot less at her husband. I liked the honesty of the film, but be warned: Cutie and the Boxer have a complicated marriage that is not always pretty.",we need to raise our daughters to have high self-esteem ...

"I've followed this series since the beginning and found the cast and their portrayal likeable, the conversations light and enjoyable.  The lead character was a bit sarcastic and portrayed more likely as not as a bit of an jazz.  Saying inappropriate things, but other supporting characters in awkward situations (it was a bit unbelievable that a &#34;real&#34; police officer would get by with some of his shenanigans without at least getting a slap on the wrist &#34;Oh, so you publicly accused 5 people of murder this episode, announced this person was having an affair, we love you anyway, good job.....&#34;  sort of thing.Though that nagged at me a bit personally, still all in all it was entertaining.Storylines?  Murders and such?  Nothing earthshaking here, a Sherlock this guy (character) ain't.Somewhere along the line they dropped or resolved a lot of the interpersonal issues, which was all that was really driving this thing in Season(s) 2 3, and the direction seems to be to focus on the problems of the single mom in the show &#34;Callie&#34; to a large extent.  I'm sure there's a demographic that loves the whole selecting the wedding date, what apartment should I live in, and how do I deal with my teenage son....Me?

"I jumped on top of this train all the way back in season 1.Was looking for something a bit different, that didn't take itself overly seriouslyand had a great ensemble cast.  It filled that bill quite nicely,The premise, Mike is a pothead (Sure there's a better, more current term), who also hasa sort of eidetic memory (can retain everything and apparently actually understand it allas well.)  To support his habit, he takes the bar exam for people.Premiere episode (which I give a 4 star rating), has him trying to hide at a hotel where theyare holding ""auditions"" for newbie lawyers for one of the biggest law firms in New York.Once he demonstrates his ability to Harvey, Harvey sneaks him into the firm as the newkid on the block.So, a lot of unbelievable action here, Harvey is a big time lawyer, big time money and he'sgoing to risk it all on (and I'm guessing here) a kid who is ""illegal"", no papers?hmmmm.Well, this all leads to some pretty entertaining episodes in season 1, I highly recommend that.Season 2, someone decides there needs to be some drama in the whole thing, so they bringback an old partner that they had managed to get kicked out of the company several yearsearlier.Again episodes not bad, actors do I think a bang up job on the whole deal, they're strivingfor more tension in the episodes, and the kicker here is that the old partner (founder actually)of the firm  may  be here to take the firm back.Throw rationality out the window, ignore consequences and you'll get a decent enough ride outof it, call it 4 stars because of the whole focus on Drama (with a capital D).Break in season 2, now they're back.Let's ignore the whole streaming taking several days to get the episode online (Amazon thing),I could rant about that for days.Series seems headed more into big D rama, Mike melting down, and likely he'll recover hisfooting.  In the meantime, to me, it's sort of jumped the shark a bit.  The relationship betweenMIke and Harvey is on the rocks, Rachel is rightly pissed and Mike's off doing stuff that.... wellgiven the background they've laid for the character seems to be marginally believable, basedon what he had promised his now dead grandmother.LIke I say, I may well cancel the streaming for the next couple of episodes, come back laterand hope it finds it's groove again.","Part 1 Season 2, easily 4-5 stars...

"I don't hate this movie, but I don't perticulary like it either. It has good points, nice characters, a good pace, tense situations and good fight scenes. However this film has many flaws that drop my opinion of it. First, this film sometimes throws in cheezy moments or humor that undermine the serious situation. Second, the fact that this movie was made after a true sequel to the original makes me feel dissapointed with it. Had this been the 2nd Rec movie made, it would've been recived better as the series would be viewed as an anthology series rather then a series with one plot and another movie thrown into it (Halloween suffered the same fate).

"In this mildly entertaining thriller Stephen Dorff plays a man trapped inside a plastic case. To reveal his occupation may spoil the film's plot, so let me call him just a man. His name is Jeremy Reins, and as the film starts, he wakes up in the dark, confused and disoriented, to find there is something like a digital clock before him. The countdown is going on and it seems there is more than one person who is trapped like him. What is going on?Comparison is inevitable. The opening of ""Brake"" strongly reminds of ""Buried,"" in which Ryan Reynolds' character finds himself buried alive inside a coffin. Now let me quickly add that Gabe Torres' ""Brake"" differs from ""Buried"" at several major points. Without revealing too much, I can say that similarity ends pretty early on in the story, where we know why Jeremy is held captive.So far, the film is good. In spite of Stephen Dorff's solid performance, however, ""Brake"" is not as thrilling as it should be. The plot development is slow and contrived. The film cannot maintain the claustrophobic atmosphere that grabs our attention at its beginning, showing its hand too early in its attempt to keep us interested. The film's mid section feels drawn out, with gimmicks (like the ""countdown"" and the attacking bees) that are random and pointless. It borrows ideas from other thrillers and never develops them.Several reviewers have criticized the film's ending. While I agree with them, I also think the weak script is to be blamed for the ineffective development of the story. In short, we don't know what the trapped man wants (or needs) to do. His own survival or something else? The story goes around and around, not knowing where it wants us to take.

"The best thing that one might be able to say based entirely on the pilot episode for THE AFTER is that &#8211; so far as production and storytelling goes &#8211; it didn&#8217;t suck.  Granted, there was very little learned about the world these various characters live in &#8211; apparently, it&#8217;s the End of the World as We Know It and not everyone feels fine.  However, there&#8217;s a plot twist to the last half that smacks entirely of creative invention; that isn&#8217;t to say it&#8217;s a bad thing, but rather it&#8217;s to say that based entirely on this episode there&#8217;s no way to know with any degree of certainty whether or not the last stage development plays into a potentially greater mythology to a program.That said, there&#8217;s a handful of things going for it.  First, it&#8217;s basically filled with a cast of good looking characters, enough so that it wouldn&#8217;t be hard to tune in from week to week to see what they&#8217;re up to.  The production qualities are mostly very good, though (again) that jazzessment is only based on the 50 minutes provided &#8211; it could certainly go downhill from there.  Still, Carter has proven that he has the smarts to make something work even on a relatively limited budget as THE X FILES in its infancy made a lot of ground out of very little effects driven work.If anything, THE AFTER has a solid vibe going for it &#8211; the kind of sense that the big reveal is lurking just around the corner in the next episode.  Narratively, it &#8216;feels&#8217; like a cross between ABC TV&#8217;s LOST done by way of FLASHFORWARD but on a vastly lower budget.  Again, that isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing considering this was basically a &#8216;pilot&#8217;; we&#8217;ll see if it&#8217;s given legs, though I&#8217;d have to wonder if it might be cost prohibitive for an outlet as limited as Amazon.com.  (Maybe a joint production?)As it&#8217;s coming from Chris Carter, my guess is that he has some game plan in mind, but if THE X FILES is any indication I suspect there&#8217;s no &#8220;end game.&#8221;  For what it's worth, it kept my interest up until about the last ten minutes, when the story turned into a less cohesive 'adventure' involving gunplay, the usual suspects (a gang incident), and taking it on the lam.  Sure, I get that this was all a set up for the final 'twist,' but as there's no possible way to evaluate the strength or weakness of that 'twist' based on what we're given here that ends up being little more than an academic execise ...... unless there's a next time, of course.",Good Vibe ...

"Outside of seeing well proportioned Ashley Hinshaw (""Chronicle"") in her birthday suit, there's not much to be said of this surprisingly not very sexy film about the porn industry.  Ms. Hinshaw is Angelina, an about to graduate 18 year old who decides not to finish high school but escape her miserable home life.  Her mother (Lili Taylor) is drunk most of the time.  Her step dad is a hulking boozer himself who comes home looking for trouble and you just know he's not far from a molestation charge, either with Angel or her younger sister.After Angelina's rocker boyfriend (Jonny Weston) pawns her off on a buddy to in order to pose for some suggestive pictures for the internet, she decides she has enough money to escape Long Beach for San Francisco.  She drags along her best friend, Andrew (Dev Patel) and they move in together in a tight sublet with the owner (Vincent Palo) who is very gay, but to be clear, Andrew isn't.  This is one of the problems with the film.  The relationship between Angel and Andrew.  They sleep in the same bed, she usually in her undies or less.  He clearly has a thing for her but nothing happens?  Oh, they're just friends.  Puleeze.  At least make the guy gay.In any case Angelina goes for an interview with a porn studio.  Surprise, she gets the job.  Initially, just a one woman show for the internet and some stills.  Then she agrees to do some girl on girl.  And eventually boy girl.  To Angel, now called Cherry, this is all just a job.  I'm guessing this is pretty accurate for performers in the industry.  But as you might expect, Andrew isn't keen on the idea, nor is Angel Cherry's new boyfriend and rich social stud, Frances (James Franco).Another subplot involves one of the studio's directors, Margaret (Heather Graham), who clearly has eyes for Cherry herself.  Margaret must first shake loose from a live in romantic relationship with her real estate agent girlfriend (Diane Farr).  Interestingly enough, Ms. Graham is no stranger to porn industry films, given her role as the always naked ""Rollergirl"" in Boogie Nights.  Here she manages to keep her clothes on but does go down on Ms. Farr's character.  When this relationship ends, we don't seem to care much.  This is a theme throughout the film.I do think the filmmakers took a weak stab at showing the business side of porn, but decided to move on to the tawdry aspects of the various pairings.  Some of the dialog in the film is ridiculous, bordering on laughable.  In spite of Cherry's cheeriness, this film is not a happy affair.Shot with HD cameras, the film looks just fine.  The resolution comes in at 1080p with a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  Colors are very good, especially skin tones, which of course is very helpful in a movie like this that has plenty of skin.  Contrast and detail are excellent.  The audio is also very good with the DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 track.  There's not a lot going on in the surrounds, although there are some scenes in a strip club and the music resonates quite well.

"I bet this is the kind of show actors thumb wrestle their agents to get into: a chance to play a different role in every episode.  Subtle writing, lurking secrets, and explosive action make even jaded viewers like me hang on.  I only wish the performances were on par with the background.  Then this merely good show could be great.Deep beneath Los Angeles, a shadowy organization uses advanced tech to reprogram human beings into whatever they need to be.  Working at once to evade the law and to get immensely rich, the Dollhouse promises the moon to anybody who can afford to pay.  What they can't promise is that they can control the implications.Series principal Eliza Dushku is an odd choice on which to hang an action drama.  The role was created for her, and it plays to her strengths, letting her be essentially vacant as the camera longingly admires her body and her fighting chops.  The show operates at its peak when the camera turns its gaze on the other actors.And what a supporting cast.  Harry Lennix, Olivia Williams, and Tamoh Penikett lead an ensemble through the kind of paces that must make Equity lawyers see dollar signs, from action to romance to comedy and back.  They are capable of so much, but the camera so loves Dushku that they get far too little face time.The story benefits from Joss Whedon's distinctive humor and eye for an off kilter story.  But not every actor is up to Whedon's particular demands.  Fran Krantz in particular wants to overplay the humor, and winds up mugging for the camera, while Miracle Laurie, so good in the dramatic and romantic scenes, sucks laughter away like a comedy Hoover.Moreover, the show's political implication, that technology's force panders to human weakness, is good but overplayed.  At various points, different characters state the series thesis explicitly, apparently because the creators think we're too thick to put the pieces together.  Considering how subtle the story is, the moral should be equally restrained.This show will likely be remembered as one of TV's great ""Almost Was"" moments.  Like Whedon's other lost cljazzic, Firefly, people will talk about it in wishful tones, mourning all the missed potential.

Second, anyone watching the show probably has a good understanding of geology and other sciences, we do not need all the dramatic music and spiffy techy overlays, it really cheapens it.

"The worst about this movie is the script.  The writing has a sloppy structure so the movie comes off like a bunch of disjointed scenes that the writer struggled to fit together into some kind of 'story' (which this film doesn't have much of anyway)... making the story take second place to the attempt at fitting the dialogues in.  It's not really that funny either.  I did laugh I think 4 times though so it does have funny moments.  Among the list of things that makes this film utterly ununique  there is only one female lead she's only there to serve as the sexual interest of the main character.  Josh Groban's character is funny, but Josh Groban is not totally convincing in playing him.  Glenn Howerton does a good job, but his body language wasn't that of a guy who is 'too responsible' or 'too nice'.  He has a certain swagger that makes him appear to be a bit more arrogant than the character suggests  perhaps due to playing Dennis for too long. But this perhaps is being nit picky as otherwise he does a good job and obviously has talent.  The female lead  her acting was eh.  Obviously she's some model who just woke up one morning and decided to become an actress.  Though truth be told they probably all could've done better if the script was any good   Doesn't matter how well the bricks are laid  if you have a crappy foundation to work with the building will come tumbling down.*******Spoilers beyond this point*******Did I miss something? I thought Josh Groban stole the money from the register and had the cash in his pocket.  Yet when the police came none of them were searched and Groban goes home with the money...without the manager ever noticing that the cash was gone?

"I'll never forget the first time I watched The Office.  I had always been very reluctant, because I had seen the previews, and I even watched the pilot (which I didn't like), so I never gave it a chance.  Then, my best friend and I were on a flight from California to Key West (6 hours), and at some point he pjazzed his laptop over to me and told me to watch an episode or two.  I figured I had nothing to lose, and just picked a random episode from season 3 (the newest season at the time).  I remember laughing so stupidly hard that other pjazzengers on the plane probably thought that I was insane.Throughout that trip, I watched both season 2 and season 3, and never missed another episode.Fast forward a few years now, and I met my future wife.  When we were hanging out at her family's house, I'd be channel surfing, and I'd come to the Office, a show that she said ""looked boring"".  I guess this was time for me to pay it forward.  She said she'd seen a few scenes when her brother had put it on, but that was it.  Well, she watched some of that season (season 6, I want to say), and was hooked, so we started watching from the very beginning, and I was able to relive the Office memories all over again.We really feel like we had a personal connection with the characters, specifically Jim & Pam.  The way their relationship started was very similar to ours...work place crushes while we both had significant others...the eventual relationship...the 'office' wedding, even their attitude and interests kind of mirrored ours.  It was even more freakishly similar when I was offered a job near Philadelphia, and we trekked across the country to try something new   even though the situations were pretty different, the feelings that both Jim & Pam had may have been a bit similar.This past season wasn't it's strongest...it wasn't the weakest, season 8 takes that cake, but it definitely wasn't up to par with the earlier seasons.  Many of the main cast members had left, the most devastating departure being Steve Carrell as Michael Scott, the original bone headed but ultimately pretty sweet manager of the paper branch.  Many of the writers had moved on as well, and it was evident.  There were story lines and characters here that just didn't feel interesting (Erin & Plop), funny (Andy), or needed (Nelly).  There were entire episodes where I didn't laugh once.  However, the end of the season is strong, particularly the last few episodes, and the finale is a fantastic send off that honestly had my wife and I crying like babies.In short, this was not the best season of this show, but it's still required viewing if you're a long time fan.  If you've been with the characters like I have for 8 years, you owe it to yourself to watch this all wrap up.  Even with the weak installments, I'd still put it in with the elite TV comedies (Arrested Development, Seinfeld, Curb Your Enthusiasm), and when this show really hit it's stride (season 3, 4) it was some of the best comedy on TV of all time.Goodbye, Dunder Mifflin.

Then the show takes his crimes and jazzigns them to other people. Where now he is helping catch the people. For example in the movie he kills the man in the orchestra for playing bad. In the show another man kills him to make a violin out of him. Also the main character of the show isn't Hannibal. It is Will Graham who is the prequel to silence of the lambs. That movie is Manhunt. In that movie Will is a strong character in this show he is a weak deranged great thinker, and Hannibal has been turned from Anthony Hopkins who portrayed power, to a much leaner man who doesn't look like he would have the strength to carry out the deeds that Hannibal Lector performed.

"This film starts with an eerie and inventive premise. It leaves a more haunting, memorable trail than most movies in the genre. But in between its first and its lasting impressions, it somewhat loses its way in the dark.Too much goes unexplained. For example, we see John Leguizamo stranded in his darkened movie theater one minute   then we next see him lying battered and bruised in an illuminated bus stop shelter. What happened to get him there? In his commentary, Director Anderson says that there was some scripting that would have explained Leguizamo's trajectory, but a variety of constraints prevented this explanation from becoming part of the film. Actually, Anderson thought this was all to the good though   that some things were best left to the imagination. I'm not so sure about that. It seems Leguizamo's navigation of the engulfing, vanquishing night would have been one of the processes most interesting to watch. Without showing such process, the film too often ends up being just abrupt, choppy, and undeveloped.It also has too many lapses of logic. The creeping darkness doesn't play fair. It shifts its rules of engagement, overwhelming one person, while allowing another similarly situated person to survive, at least for a while. Well, that could be an additional aspect of the evil of the darkness. It toys randomly with its victims, like a cat may or may not toy with a mouse, sheerly on a whim.Then I had one of my common technical complaints about this film. The DVD often projected as an indecipherable smudge on my TV screen. So it ran as murky rather than sinisterly dark. There is something about the final lighting filtering process that many modern filmmakers use that causes their movies to be a chore to watch on home TV's. I wish filmmakers would get back to whatever technology was used from the 1920's through the 1960's that allows their films to play as appropriately shaded rather than just obscure when run on a TV screen.The Director's commentary doesn't add a lot to a viewer's appreciation of the film. Brad Anderson starts out sounding too much like Ben Stein, making a dreary, nasal drone of his narrative. So unless you have a lot of spare time, you can probably skip the commentary and most of the other extras, except for the interviews.However the Director's commentary does highlight at least one telling aspect of this film and its making. Anderson talks about how apt it was to settle on Detroit as a location for the action. The City itself is perhaps the most fascinating character in the entire movie. It becomes an icon of our crumbling economy, our crumbling culture. Some of the scenes in the movie call for shots of major urban intersections shown desolate, abandoned, post apocalyptic. Anderson said that he hardly had to clear Detroit's streets and highways of cars and people for these scenes. They are already so often eerily null. So many buildings are already hollow, echoing shells of once vital industries. These shots in and of themselves served as chilling prognostications of what can in reality befall all our cheery, oblivious bustle.So this movie is overall worth watching   for its darkling premise, and for its stunning views of Detroit.",Too Often Leaves Us in the Dark,1308355200,"06 18, 2011",3,0

"""Atlantis Treads Water"" was my review for the third season, and for this season I sadly had to come up with another way to say that a lot of water got splooshed around but it didn't seem to go anywhere.On the upside, we've got likeable characters, now joined by Sam Carter from Stargate SG 1.  But on the downside, we're still going back and forth between Wraith and Replicators.  It's getting old.It's too bad this series isn't more about exploration and discovery, like the orginal Star Trek was.  We can have recuring bad guys that need to be dealt with, but we an also have adventure and discovery, which seems to be lacking in this series considering they can get anywhere to a new galaxy they want and back nearly instantaneously.Looking back on this season, I felt like I'd kept up with old friends and had some good times, but I asked myself if anything really made me go ""Wow"" (like the Wraith seige of Atlantis) and I couldn't remember anything.  I think they need to get rid of the Wraith and the Replicators once and for all and move on to something radically different.The season finale cliffhanger was rather good, so here's hoping for season five.",From treading water to dogpaddling in circles.,1219795200,"08 27, 2008",3,0
"Anyone anticipating ""The Samaritan"" to be a high octane thrill ride will probably have those expectations thwarted.  Truthfully, I also didn't expect much from this Blu ray and thought it would be an exercise in conventional action mayhem.  It is, however, a movie with a lot more on its mind. ""The Samaritan"" is a surprisingly contemplative film about redemption and second chances.  Featuring a solid Samuel Jackson, the screenplay takes its time in building a genuinely interesting story.  Jackson gives one of his more complex performances as a man struggling to create a new life, a new identity, and start afresh.  He's great and the movie serves up some terrifically unpleasant surprises (the twist at the half way point is a doozy)!  But just as the movie approaches the final act, it falters.  An intricate con to swindle a crime lord out of millions of dollars is set up with almost zero preparation and back story.  If a clever grift is essential to your screenplay, however, it needs to be smart and believable (or in some cases breezy and fun).  This one is so ill conceived (major players change out hours before the meet, this must be one idiotic crime boss to not check out ANYTHING) that it almost derails the picture just when it's reaching the most pivotal moments.Jackson plays an ex con, recently paroled after a 25 year stint.  He wants to live a quiet life, but he gets drawn into the criminal world again by the son of a former jazzociate (Luke Kirby).  Although reticent, Jackson allows Kirby an entrance due to the fact that he was personally responsible for his father's death.  When a young woman in Kirby's employ (Ruth Negga) comes between the two, it just might be the leverage that Kirby needs to get Jackson to sign on for a job.  Can Jackson extricate himself from an ever tightening web?  The build up leads to a final confrontation (Tom Wilkinson plays the mark) that is effectively staged and emotional.  But it really falls short in a set up.  Without believing anything about this final scenario, it really lessened the impact of the movie.  The vibe of the film is gritty realness, this ending just didn't follow through on that promise.Still, if you are a Jackson fan, this is one of his more nuanced roles of late.  Beaten down by life, his detachment has a chilly truth.  He is still a great actor capable of showcasing complex and multi leveled roles, and this definitely qualifies.  I liked Kirby's cool menace as well.  Once again, ""The Samaritan"" works best when considered an introspective character study.  It is marketed more as a non stop action movie, though, and that really doesn't address the primary audience for the movie.  This has a slow burn pace that builds tension.  I just wish that the payoff was smarter.  I went from being deeply engrossed to rolling my eyes in disbelief within minutes.  About 3 1 2 stars.  Let's hope Jackson keeps taking more challenging roles.

"And so it did come to pjazz, that on December 16, 2010 the Syfy channel announced what many of us had expected, the cancellation of SGU. What did it say for MGM that they didn't even have the courage to announce this termination?

So Benedict Cumberbatch plays this socially awkward genius with a family connection in the government to help figure out the death of his brother.  Add some government conspiracies and Afghanistan spy intrigue and there we go for nice dramatic miniseries.What makes it especially relevant today is the government Total Information Access (TIA) where they use big data to spy on citizens.  It probably was more sci fi when this was filmed but now we know the NSA is already doing this to us.  For each episode a narrator came on to explain the TIA to us if the exposition in the show wasn't enough.In general I liked the series.

Being a found footage film, &#8220;Europa Report&#8221; tells the story of six astronauts, using images of head cameras and monitor cameras in a spaceship, as well as talking heads scenes.The film is very unique and ambitious in its effort to stick to realism, using the found footage format that has become very familiar to us. While the method manages to visually enhance the reality of the film, especially its claustrophobic atmosphere, it inevitably makes the film reliant on dialogues that are often heavy and not always interesting.But I think the biggest problem is the film&#8217;s storyline itself. The idea of a privately funded spaceship travelling to discover the evidence of extraterrestrial life is not something that I can believe, especially when the film makes almost no effort to make us care the characters and their mission.

"This one is a little difficult to watch; while there are a few interesting moments there seem to be an abundance of meaningless filler moments that are difficult to watch. At midpoint I had to stop it and recover before I could go on with the movie the next day. You may well ask why I bothered and the only answer I can provide to that question was a slight curiosity how it would end.A little over half way through the movie starts getting a little more interesting as the two leads start their return to the USA. A serious libido problem on the guy's part causes them to miss a vital connection on their return trip and choose an alternate route home through dangerous territory.Much of the story is told after dark so the demands on the cgi are correspondingly reduced. In its favor there are some effective scenes showing life in the Mexican villages and some of the sequences are marginally interesting.Now let's consider another possibility; what if the alien monsters were symbolic of drug cartels, what if the whole thing is an allegory for the current situation with drug cartels in Northern Mexico? If one thinks in those terms there are some interesting parallels; for example the efforts of the United States to protect itself with a wall. Another would be the infected zones and their parallel with areas controlled by the cartels. The alien monsters had long tentacles which is similar to the tentacles of influence exercised by the cartels. The monsters were most active after dark which also characterizes the cartels. In those areas attacked by the monsters there was much devastation which is also a goal of the cartels. Another parallel are the evacuated zones in the United States; there are already areas of Arizona where citizens are warned not to go, are these infected zones perhaps?I've not seen any suggestions that the allegorical nature of Monsters is intended to reflect Northern Mexico's drug problem but it does make for some interesting speculation.If you are a dedicated sci fi fan you may want to watch it just so you can say you did or you may want to check me out on my allegory speculation.

"Universal Soldier:Day of Reckoning(released Oct 12)has Jean Claude Van Damme as Luc Deveraux and Dolph Lundgren as Andrew Scott,back in their previous roles.Joining them in the drivers seat is Scott Adkins as John.Scott plays a hard driving and relentless character here,something in the vein of Jason Statham,as a man on a mission.The story finds Scott being woken up by his daughter claiming there are monsters in the house.When he reaches the kitchen he is repeatedly knocked down by a masked man with a crowbar.After a short time both his wife and daughter are also brought down to the kitchen and are executed before his eyes,by a man who reveals himself as van Damme.Nine months later he awakes in a hospital(the fact that a ""nurse"" who feeds him while he is in bed,then checks him out behind a desk,would lead one to think this is more than just a hospital).He is interviewed by a man claiming he is an FBI agent and to call him if he thinks of anything related to the murders,which of course are indelibly etched in his mind.Time pjazzes and Scott is indeed released and he goes home to try and find himself.He receives a phone call from a nervous man who knows him and has something for him.When Scott arrives the man is dead.He spots a matchbook on a table with the name of a club on it and heads there and meets up with a girl who knows him,but not visa versa.He gets kicked out but later follows her to her apartment.She has known Scott for quite awhile and has been afraid of his terrible temper,relating a story of beating a man to death.While there a man barges in on them and tries to kill Scott.They both escape but are followed and end the fight in a sporting goods store.Meanwhile we see that Van Damme is the leader of a Unisol resistance movement and Lundgren is his second lieutenant,if you will.They are trying to free all former and current Unisols from their bondage from the government.It seems Scott is a Unisol,so bred to infiltrate the new Unisol movement and kill Van Damme;though he doesn't know it yet.Scott eventually manages to find the Unisol hideout where they try and remove his implanted memory of his wife and daughter's murders.Something goes wrong while in the chair and he frees himself,kills the lab techs and systematically fights his way through.He dispatches each with particularly devastating skill until he meets with Lundgren.He gives Scott a good run for the money,but Scott comes out victorious.Then it's on to Van Damme.Van Damme and Scott go toe to toe and it all ends there.The film comes to its conclusion as Scott meets up with the FBI agent,who explains that Scott was bred just to kill Van Damme.No one before had succeeded until now.Blaming him for his wife's death,Scott shoots the agent.Anticipating his reaction,out of a nearby van steps out the same agent,then other Unisols,to take away the dead clone(?).I must say off the top I cannot fault Scott Adkins acting,as he plays his part very well.He wears the part of a confused man,trying to find himself but filled with revenge,like a tee shirt.Unlike the last poor installment,this fourth Universal Soldier(there were two others without Van Damme and company)is much better plot wise and in pace.But someone has to tell me: 1)where in the heck is the franchise going?2)where did it go wrong?and 3)why does van Damme and company continue down this strange road? The first one had Van Damme as a Unisol who in the end snaps out of who and what he is.In the second he is totally in control of himself and has a daughter and even jazzists with work in the lab.For all intents and purposes he is totally a near normal guy.The last one,after all the time in between,brings Van Damme back as a non speaking drone,who seeing Lundgren,battles it out with him once more.No explanation given whatsoever as to why Van Damme is now a Unisol again.And now they continue in the same very dark vein,but things have obviously evolved and Van Damme is now the leader of a resistance movement,with a shaved head.Watch that head,because when Adkins has his final showdown,JCVD has his head painted white and black! I know this emphasizes where Van Dammes character has ""gone"",but it's all totally nonsensical stuff in the bigger context.Plot wise,I can see Reckoning as the second installment and the second as the third.The real third installment,well I cannot see it period.My point is neither of these newer Universal Soldier movies are in keeping plot or character wise,with what went on in the first two.So,how in God's creation did we get here and why do they continue down the same dreadful and inexplicable path? I might add,though Van Damme appears here more than the third(which was pitifully small),he appears not MUCH more.JC and Dolph's appearance's are just glorified cameos!Oh yes,watch for Van Damme's son in a bit part as an ""FBI"" agent in the ""hospital"".Technically speaking the film is in its w s a r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include interviews with Lundgren,Adkins,Van Damme and director Hyams.All in all while much better than the third installment,this film again sees the entire cast and crew deviating as far away from any connection with the first two movies as they can possibly go.I suggest if you have the first two watch them again,and if you haven't buy or rent them.Then you maybe can explain to me this total digression in characterization and warping of the franchise as a whole.","2+2=2 good,too bad!",1359244800,"01 27, 2013",3,0

"I really like some of the ideas that make this show. However, I probably could write a paper on what I do not like about Bitten. Since I keep watching I will be gentle and just hit some highlights:1. I will pretty much watch anything with werewolves, vampires; especially with an action thriller backdrop (Okay NOT Twilight, Vamp Dairies  BUT I really tried)2. I liked (not loved) the lead (Laura Vandervoort) in the series V3. She is attractive, but there is something missing for her in this role. She has no dark side or kick butt side. They paint her to be special  like powerful and an amazing tracker, but the way the show plays, she is never special at all. I think she may be capable (as an actress), but they have not directed her in a way to pull off this character.4. The Alpha Dog is more like the omega puppy. I do not like the Clay (the enforcer) character too much  jury is still out on whether the budding love triangle with work or even makes sense, but would rather see him in the  (Alpha) role if they cannot improve Jeremy.5. Women are not strong enough to handle the change.     Really?? Do I even need to comment? Listen, I know you can have babies and all   which is a drastic change to your body, but your body cannot stand this change. Men can go through this change with no issue, but you could never handle this. Oh, except for the ONE lady here who by the way, we keep having to save, because she is not that strong. If she was `special' if she was more powerful, then the entire premise (women cannot handle the change) would make sense. I know men are more physically strong, but this is an internal as well as external change. It would make more sense if men could not change. If they want to work this angle, they need to have more than one woman who can change and do a better sensible job on why women cannot change or establish that the women who do change are different in some kind of way.If you love werewolves or you are in need of yet another love triangle, you have to check out at least one episode.","You will wait and wait, but the lead never really delivers",1394496000,"03 11, 2014",3,0

"First off, Lara Spencer is amazingly beautiful!  I never knew who she was until this show, but now I'm a fan.  Yeah, she's pretty talented, too.  I wish the producers would have kept the same idea from the 1st episode, where the two teams compete for the profit that both teams earned from flipping their items.  By the 2nd episode, the two teams were competing for $5,000, but profit had nothing to do with winning; only the total amount of the sales for the day determined the winner.  To me, profit is the most important aspect of the flip.  But, it's still kind of a cool show.  However, it's WAY more of an artistic designer's show than I would like.  These teams have to be imaginative and creative.  They have to turn junk into works of art.  This isn't your typical &#34;picker&#34; or &#34;pawn&#34; show, which I tend to like much more.  I would think if you like &#34;design this house,&#34; or &#34;design this kitchen,&#34; for example, you would really like this show.",This is an artistic/designer-type show.,1384905600,"11 20, 2013",3,0
"I've never actually watched Entourage, but I'm willing to bet that my initial reaction that this is ""Entourage for nerds"" is probably pretty right on. It's written both by people who know how nerds talk without pandering, and people who have watched quite a few sitcoms in the last ten years. There's honestly nothing super duper special about the show, but I rather enjoy it. The main characters fall into distinct categories (Anti Social Nerd, Terrible Nerd, Main Character Nerd and Super Dweeb), and Ed Begley Jr. is pretty underused (because he does weird very well, and I want more of that weird), but the characters actually seemed realistic, down to earth, and normal. Terrible Nerd falls into a lot of the traps that most of the other characters of his ilk do, but again, nothing that seems out of the ordinary. It seems like the show might be a good slice of life comedy for techies in modern day Silicon Valley, and it's made cheap enough that I could see it getting picked up just because, well, why not?",Entourage for Nerds...

"This review is for Cosmic Journeys: Episode 101: Mysteries of a Dark Universe [HD](I have to tell you because Amazon lumps all reviews for all episodes together).It's like a video put together for 7th grade physical science with one crucial exception: a few extraordinarily good chunks of current information are tossed out occasionally. This is a weird program. The format, narrator and music motivate you to turn it off 90 seconds in. It was very difficult to endure the first half at which point the nuggets began to be thrown out.There are just enough gems of up to date information that it's worth watching. But most of the content is gag me awful recitations of the history of astronomical discoveries and bore you to death remedial information.The narrator and music MUST be done over. Oh my goodness! The lethargic, not to bright sounding old man voice has to go! Yuck! And the music is so terrible it's difficult to imagine what the people responsible were thinking. It's like bad elevator music. Seriously. I thought that awful twangy guitar of the &#34;Tour the Planets&#34; series was bad. This one is worse.Fortunately, this program decided not to fill most of the time with geeky talking head scientists. There was only one as far as I can remember. Unfortunately, they chose Michelle Thaller who is the most irritating and obnoxious talking head and she shows up in just about every astronomical documentary made in recent years. Her high pitched condescending inflection and geeky lame attempted humor do not contribute positively to the program.Note to all nature & science documentary producers: stop with the talking head geeks! And stop trying to make drama where it doesn't exist. Scientists are geeks. Don't want to see them talking. Don't want to see them arguing.

"Set in Glasgow, ""Perfect Sense"" follows the story of a chef Michael (Ewan McGregor) and an epidemiologist Susan (Eva Green) falling in love with other just when a strange epidemic spreads all over the world, depriving the people of the sense of smell. Things don't stop there, but people are resilient, as the film's voiceover says, ""life goes on.""This is a sci fi romance with an unusual premise, or a modern day parable beautifully shot and well acted, with a positive message about life, something that is also thought provoking ... if you can ignore the film's pretentious and manipulative narrative.While director David Mackenzie manages to visualize the impending apocalypse effectively with minimum use of props, there is something artificial about the way the whole story is told. What if you lose your sense of smell? Pretty early on you will know where the film is trying to lead us to. ""Perfect Sense"" certainly does what it sets out to do confidently, even though I really don't care what is going on in this alternative universe of the emotionally distant film.Like some art house movies, ""Perfect Sense"" makes a point of showing what is obvious in a novel way.","Beautiful, Intelligent, and Emotionally Distant",1373760000,"07 14, 2013",3,0

"I like some musicals.  Don't care for Glee.  But that's mostly because of the high school setting.So I was ready to give this a try after choosing some of the other pilots I thought better of at first.  And I'm beginning to find that what I thought would be good was not so much.  And some of the one's I skipped I shouldn't have.The musical numbers are good enough to be amusing and hold interest.They should kiss Bebe Neuwirth's feet in between steps for being on this show as it's the only reason I even thought to try it.  She is fantastic.I got a kick out of the opening blurb about beware this has musical numbers.  That helped to take the spirit of the show as tongue in cheek.  So for people using criticism that they didn't like the musical numbers, I think they were well warned.As a musical (show), I guess you'd have to take the quality of the singing into account and perhaps the song writing too.  But I think both were good enough.  I did start to feel the opening number drag on.  But in the context of introducing the show for what it is completely appropriate and well done.  If you can continue to watch after that, you might find you really enjoy this show.To that end I did start to suffer some fatigue at the musical numbers, but just when I started to check the time remaining it was over.  I realized it had charmed me enough to sit through the whole thing without realizing I had.I definitely would like to see this show get a chance to continue.  What I fear is that it's not sustainable.  But I'd like to find out.The characters are starting out too stereotypical.  I'm sure that's ""pilot itis"".  If they can flesh out the characters and be less stereotypical then it could be something.Bebe's character's musical number was hilarious.

"I wrote a lengthy review for the first season of this show. I'll try to keep this one short.There are a few spoilers in this review. Not major ones, but I thought I'd mention this.I still like the returning characters, except for Karen, who, as I wrote in my review of Season 1, is just too nice and one dimensional to be interesting. Everyone else from the first season is still great. Ivy becomes even more likable, so does Derek. Derek shows a softer side, for a change. Tom, Julia, and Eileen are still excellent characters.I do not like Jimmy, the troubled composer who was not in the first season. He, like Karen, is too one dimensional.. not a complicated enough character. He gets on my nerves.Ana, Karen's roommate, is a main character. I didn't find Ana to be particularly interesting. She's ok, but hard to accept as a potential Broadway star.I also do not like ""Hit List,"" the musical created by Jimmy, and his best friend Kyle. I've had very little exposure to Broadway musicals. Maybe ""Hit List"" is good, but I like ""Bombshell"" a LOT better. It's hard to see ""Hit List"" as being a serious contender for the Tony awards. Also, sometimes the plot for ""Hit List"" seemed unclear to me. Maybe I just watched too many episodes of season 2 when I was quite tired.The plot of ""Smash"" is less focused than in season 1. The show seems to wander around a bit too much sometimes, especially since there are two musicals (and the personal lives of people in two musicals) in development instead of one this season.Lastly, this is a minor thing, but a disappointment. Things didn't turn out well enough for Sam. I think Sam is a good character. I had high hopes for him.Some things I did like besides those I already mentioned.. guest appearances by two singing stars who I shall not mention because I don't want to give away the surprise.Also, the script, at times, is still rather good.Yeah, season 1 was better, but season 2 is still worth watching.","Decent, but not as good as Season 1.",1401062400,"05 26, 2014",3,0

"I chose the rating of 3 stars for this movie because I went into it with far higher expectations mostly due to the 4 & 5 star ratings that other reviewers gave. I was let down by the plot, but the premise and emotional value somewhat made up for that.This movie starts with the sponsorship of a 6 year old girl in China by an Australian man who undoubtedly (thankfully) believed he would be helping an orphaned child. This child was able to go to school and live better in her orphanage. She and Mr. Randell have a prolific exchange of letters and postcards over a ten year period.No spoilers here, but as you can read in the description that the girl at age 16 has the opportunity to meet her sponsor...and she arrives uninvited. What she finds, in her words, make &#34;everything all wrong&#34; .The girl, who lacks a real name as she couldn't remember it when she arrived at the orphanage is called Mei Mei, meaning Little Sister. This is an important aspect of the movie. The rest of the movie relies upon this small bit to carry out the duration.There are two bit gangster wanna be bad guys who run a two bit mafia like organization. However, they are not portrayed very menacingly and therefor, in my opinion, really just look and act like older bullies from middle school.A lot of reviewers on here also stated the movie was too 'disturbing' and 'violent'. One even said they could only watched for twenty minutes due to these reasons. So I watched for anything that might indicate these statements to be true, and there absolutely was not one thing. No nudity, no sexual activity, no violence obviously defined except for a couple fist fights and implied 'messing you up bad' bully statements.The biggest thing I got out of this movie was the understanding that a good deed may come with a false underlying story and that even though the truth will avail, there is always room for forgiveness, love and a future.I would say: Watch this one.

"It's always risky to name your movie something like ""It's a Disaster.""  Naturally, it gives film critics    and wannabe film critics    some pretty hefty ammunition.  And the film better be really good; otherwise that ammunition might just blow up in the film's face at review time.This doesn't quite happen with this film, but not for lack of trying.  I haven't looked at who directed or wrote this film yet, but evidently, one or both of them are probably fans of Woody Allen.  The dialog in Mr. Allen's films usually work, even though that dialog isn't always exactly realistic, and the dialog here isn't really completely realistic either.  After all, if you thought that the world might be ending, would you be standing around cracking jokes and making dessert?  I wouldn't.  I'd be finding the bottled water in the basement and the guns upstairs, and in a hurry.But there are a few funny lines here, my favorite coming from Julia Stiles and a gal who is late, once again, to the standard Sunday brunch.  The other gal is therefore not allowed to come into the house where it is safe, as Ms. Stiles leaves the door ""barricaded"" with duct tape.  The dialog starts out something like the following:  Ms. Stiles:  ""Well, maybe this will teach you a lesson from now on to show up on time.  You're always late to Sunday brunch.""  Latecomer:  ""Is that what this is all about?"" etc. etc.  I got a good chuckle out of that sequence, and most likely, you will you when you listen to the rest of it.  Heck, Woody Allen might even think it's funny.While this film has it's moments, it feels a little ""off"" to me at the same time.  Perhaps if I were a 20 something this film would have worked better for me, as then I probably wouldn't have watched almost every Woody Allen film ever made, as I have by now, and I wouldn't understand how good well written dialog can be.  But I think that this film would have worked probably better as a play.  After all, it takes place in a very confined space in a very confined period of time with a very confined handful of friends.  And it's mostly dialog driven, which would lend itself more to the stage then screen.Still, it's probably worth a peek, but only a peek.

"In the immortal words of Charlie Brown,""Argh!"".  This film is terrific for its first two thirds.  Director Julian Gilbey wratchets the tension in this portion immeasurably.  Gilbey seems to be taking his cues from John Boorman's ""Deliverance"" and Walter Hill's ""Southern Comfort"" in exploring the age old themes of man versus an unforgiving natural terrain combined with threats from his fellow man.  It's in the film's final third where things go terribly awry.  It's here where the film devolves into a second rate ""Taken"" that makes little narrative sense.  I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie.

"DEEP SOUTH PARANORMAL, in the words of a useless TV critic, is a pathetic attempt to marry ""Duck Dynasty"" with ""Ghost Adventures"" (that critic said ""Ghost Hunters"" but I disagree). Ostensibly composed of a team of Alabama boys on the one hand and Louisiana Cajuns on the other, SOUTH takes us to not so spooky locations in ... well, the deep South.Well, this gang here comes off a lot smarter than the idiots from ""Ghost Adventures"", but the same old tired night vision swelling creepy music for absolutely no reason is here too. The difference is these boys have fun, don't mind showing their true selves, and on occasion simply eat instead of doing their work but when they work at least there's not so much fakery as there is in the other paranormal shows. Even ""The Haunted Collector"" has gone totally off its rails. I admit DEEP SOUTH is a lot more fun than watching Zak Bagan's constant agonizing, as operatic and drama queenish as Ryan Buell when he was doing ""Paranormal State"".Well, one day the paranormal craze will end, the Southern Idiot Show and Idiot Southerner Show will end, the pointless outdoors oriented shows will end ... and what then? I keep praying a new Gene Rodenberry will present himself (or herself) and make some good TV.I was the first critic, several decades ago, to decry the lack of any decent, genuine Southern oriented shows on TV or in cinema. In the movies they had boneheads from New England playing Southern roles. It made me sick. Even worse is today's trend showing duck hunters, a beauty pageant child from Georgia and other atrocities.Someone else kindly critiqued this trend, saying audiences have had enough with Kardashians and real housewives: they want some gentle, humorous distractions on TV and the folks of the South are the ones to do it. Well I agree totally, but the folks of the South also need to step up to the plate.The only   and I do mean only   individual here worth a show of his own is ""Old"" Hart Fortenbery, the Cajun magician who openly and humorously practices the Gris Gris religion that is centered around his native Louisiana. I know characters like Hart, and I just love him. In fact, reviewers of SOUTH often chase after what I call ""Hartisms"", Old Hart's incredibly hilarious lines and pronouncements.My personal favorite Hartism, which you won't hear on DEEP SOUTH, is Hart's advice to young people: ""Chase your dream until you catch it.

">>>>> this review contains spoilers if you haven't seen episode 1 of the season &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;So, Nick turns into a zombie and then survives a drastic plane crash. Seriously? I suppose you are going to tell me that because he is a zombie, he survived the crash? Sorry: just because you have a supernatural show, that doesn't mean you can pull this kind of crap and expect us to gladly accept it. There comes a point in many network serials where a line is crossed and the trust of the audience is betrayed. Unfortunately this moment came too soon for such a promising show that is only in its adolescence. I will continue to watch Grimm until its demise, but my viewing of it has been changed irrevocably.Why zombies, Grimm? I know you would like to have as large a viewership asThe Walking Dead: Season 3, but honestly we could have done without Zombie Nick. I may be able to forgive you as long as you don't start up with vampires too. And please don't ask us to believe that Nick can survive things like a plane crash in the woods that leaves the fuselage in tatters; what is next, a fall from the top of St. Johns Bridge? This is not LOST, nor is Nick a superhero... he is a Grimm. Well, I guess the writers can make him whatever they want him to be, but Arrow (e.g.,Three Ghosts) is already doing the superhero.UPDATE 12 19 2013: Okay, the season is showing improvement. More time spent in Europe, which broadens the story arc significantly and provides more screen time for Sasha Roiz (one of the better actors on the show). And no more zombies! At least we got something out of the zombie detour: Nick was able to keep a superpower from his coffin time.There was a ""homicidal Santa"" episode (Twelve Days Of Krampus) that was also another shark jump, but it made me laugh; not sure if this was the intent, but what the heck... If the positive trend continues, I might forget about the zombie debacle.UPDATE 3 1 2014: Although the show has become soapier due to the relationship between Monroe and Rosalee (somewhat replacing the Juliette drama that had gotten so tiresome), the writers managed to squeeze some excitement out of it by doing aGuess Who's Coming To Dinnerepisode (Revelation). Bravo. Again, Grimm shows that it can do more than plod along as a ""creature of the week"" cop show. Also, the Scooby gang is starting to gel nicely and is one of the strengths of Grimm now.FINALE UPDATE: Okay, count me back in. The introduction of Trubel was a good move, and now there's a reason to watch season 4. She'll probably get killed off or leave town when Nick gets his ""superpowers"" back, but she adds an edge to the show that was missing. Reminds me a wee bit of when Faith was introduced inBuffy the Vampire Slayer   The Complete Third Season. As for the other plot lines, I'm glad the telekinetic baby with glowing eyes has less screen time by being taken away, but I have a feeling we will be forced to watch more about superbaby next year.","Jumped the shark, but regained footing toward end of season",1383696000,"11 6, 2013",3,0
"Remember that movie &#8216;Howl&#8217;, the one that was supposed to net James Franco an Oscar?  Yeah, I don&#8217;t either.  I mean, I remember it only because it had that early hype due to subject and actor, but I never saw it and I really don&#8217;t think many people who didn&#8217;t stumble into it while it made the festival circuit did either.  It was directed by these two guys, Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman, and it got so so reviews and basically disappeared.This should have all been a sign.I remember back in the early months of 2013, when I was considering predictions for the 2013 Oscars (yes, I&#8217;m an addict) and a name that I kept flirting with was Amanda Seyfried.  She was all over the red carpets for &#8216;Les Miserables&#8217; and many people were saying that she was breaking through, finally, after years of basically being ignored or taking a backseat.  I mean, she technically took a backseat then too, to Anne Hathaway, but she was a red carpet sensation and people were taking notice.  Then it was announced that she was going to be playing Linda Lovelace and it just felt like a sign from heaven.  Young starlet getting the role of a lifetime playing the most recognizable name in the adult film industry.  It doesn&#8217;t hurt that that name is attached to a very well known film and that star was abused in multiple ways by multiple people.Talk about Oscar bait.The problem with &#8216;Lovelace&#8217; is that it lacks any style to make the substance, which is there, feel fresh and exciting.  The grungy want that it is filmed (to emulate the porn era) is interesting and then dull at the same time (been there done that) and while the two fold storytelling (telling the story twice, once glossed over and the second brutally honest) it isn&#8217;t enough to give the film the needed umph.  The character development is scarce (Look scared Seyfried!  Act mean Sarsgaard!) and this dampens the impact that this film, and her life, could have had.Linda Lovelace was brought up in a strict home and she was a merely curious young woman swept off her feet by a no good man who pretended to be good until he put a ring on her finger and then decided to beat her and sell her out for her body in order to pay his debts.  Epstein and Friedman have no visual style or storytelling skills and so the film really feels flat.  It doesn&#8217;t help that Seyfried&#8217;s performance is so bland and uninspired, and this really could have been an undeniable knock out role for her.  Sarsgaard fares slightly better, since he has a flashy character, but we&#8217;ve seen him play a sleaze MANY times, and he&#8217;s done it far better before (this is reminiscent of his turn in &#8216;Boys Don&#8217;t Cry&#8217; except not as fresh or as memorable).  Honestly, Chris Noth and Bobby Cannavale are the most memorable presences in this film, and they don&#8217;t really do a whole lot except &#8216;fit&#8217;.Don&#8217;t even get me started on James Franco&#8217;s TERRIBLE cameo as Hugh Hefner.At the end of the day, &#8216;Lovelace&#8217; isn&#8217;t offensive or bad as much as it&#8217;s pointless, and that&#8217;s sad.  What is it with all these boring directors getting their hands on baity biopics?  I mean, I understand that the biopic is becoming a tired genre, but true auteurs have given such life to these stories in the past.  In the right hands, this could have been a grittier, more violent &#8216;Boogie Nights&#8217;, but instead this feels like a Lifetime movie.",This feels very 'direct to video'...,1389830400,"01 16, 2014",3,0
"I find myself a bit torn in my opinion of The Innkeepers.  There's a lot to enjoy but there's also a fair amount to dislike about the film.  Director Ti West's story about an aging New England Inn in its final week of operation has a tone unlike most horror films.  There are a lot of elements that don't seem on the surface like they would mix together well, but the enjoyable cast makes the film eminently watchable.Claire (Paxton) and Luke (Healey) are a couple of twenty something loafers who work at the Yankee Pedlar, a New England inn that is over a hundred years old.  With the owner on vacation, Claire and Luke are the only employees still working at the near empty inn during its final week of operation.  With few guests to attend, and having to work 12 hour shifts the pair do what they can to amuse themselves and pjazz the time.  Fancying themselves amateur ghost hunters, they've setup a website to explore the legend of the Yankee Pedlar which is allegedly haunted by the spirit of a Madeline O'Malley, a woman who hung herself on her wedding day when her fianc&eacute; jilted her.As mentioned, The Innkeepers has a strange vibe to it.  The early part of the film has a good deal of comedy as the pair of Luke and Claire engage in various pursuits just to get through the day including drinking beer at the front counter, telling ghost stories to the young son of an annoying guest, just to get under her skin, and dealing with the wacky counterperson at the nearby coffee shop.  This, along with a slow pace doesn't fit with what you expect out of a horror film.  The tone changes abruptly with the arrival of Leanne Reese Jones (McGillis) a former actress turned psychic.As Claire explores the inn at night with recording equipment, looking to pickup some EVP (electronic voice phenomena) she encounters voices whispering within the walls and the playing of a piano in the front lobby.  A terrified Claire runs to Leanne for help.  The psychic uses her ability to channel the spirits in the inn and warns Claire to stay clear of the basement.  The arrival of an elderly guest who wants to spend one last night in the honeymoon suite completes the transition from slacker comedy to full on horror culminating with Claire's terrifying encounter with the inn's spirits.I suppose it depends on your outlook as to whether The Innkeeper's faults can be overlooked due to its positives or if it's positives are neutralized by the faults.  West's slow burn of a film develops the characters of Claire and Luke to the point where you can certainly relate to them.  The pair apparently have no prospects once the inn closes.  Claire's redoubtable spunkiness drives much of the action.  Last seen in the horrible film ""Shark Night"", Paxton appears here, sans tiny bikini and without make up in a huge contrast from that film. There's a brilliantly funny scene as she is trying to open a dumpster lid with one hand and toss in a leaky plastic trash bag for the other...that is just a little too heavy for her to lift with a single hand and avoid whatever noxious contents are spilling out of the bag.  The dialog sparkles with a casual wit.  You feel like you're eavesdropping on a couple of real people when they are talking.But The Innkeepers has a major Achilles heel.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the film's conclusion; so many, in fact, that I found myself re watching scenes to see if I missed the ""Shamalayan"" moment.  What did Leanne really see when she channeled the spirits?  And what was with her strange staring out of her room's window at the end?  For all of the development of the two leads, West is woefully short on any exposition when it comes to the spirits.  What are their motivations?  Why are they after Claire?  Why was it that Leanne's arrival seemed to have triggered the spirit's activity?  These issues prevent The Innkeepers from having the clean ending that most viewers desire.  But maybe that's what West was going for all along.Blu Ray ExtrasTwo Audio commentaries: One with Writer director editor Ti West, producers Peter Phok & Larry Fessenden, and second unit director sound designer Graham Reznick; and the second with Ti West and stars Sara Paxton & Pat Healy.Behinds the Scenes Featurette",Lots of holes but enjoyable,1334707200,"04 18, 2012",3,0

"Originally available to download through iTunes, Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic is now available on DVD and Blu Ray.  Whether you are a longtime fan of Alan Moore's revolutionary comic or are a newfound follower thanks to the upcoming Zack Snyder adaptation, you'd be better off checking out a single episode before laying down the cash for this Blu Ray.  As you probably already know, there is only once voice used throughout The Motion Comic, as actor Tom Stechschulte provides the voices for everyone, including the female characters.  Saying this is just plain weird to hear at first is saying it lightly (especially if you're not expecting it), but all things considered, he doesn't do as bad a job all around as it could have been.  The panels and dialogue of the comic are followed to a tee, and making Dave Gibbons' artwork breathe is a sight to behold.  Still, Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic isn't without its flaws, especially considering that the Blu Ray features basically consist of an old production diary of the upcoming film adaptation, which has been available online for quite a while now.  In the end, Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic is an interesting endeavor, but is really a worthwhile trip for die hard fans only, if only for the fact that nothing beats actually reading the comic.  Still, there are worse distractions to find as old and new fans alike wait for Zack Snyder's take on Watchmen to hit theaters.","Interesting, but for die hard fans only",1235520000,"02 25, 2009",3,0
"This show has some amazing comedy in there. But true to the Onion's comedy it is hit or miss.

"Jack and Diane appealed a lot to me at first glance. The uniquely sounding blend of romance and horror is something that definitely is up my alley. However upon viewing this very strange and offbeat drama, it wasn't quite what I would have expected. The main thing that left me hanging was the horror aspect. After waiting for the horror to arrive, at the end the only real horror elements were a few sequences that didn't quite deserve a `horror' genre tag on the film. I'm used to films not being what they are marketed as, so that wasn't a huge deal. However something else just had me put off through the most of the film. The two main actresses (Juno Temple and Riley Keough) have next to no charisma. Between the huh's and what's, not a whole lot is said. They're trying to make us believe they're lovers, having fallen in love at first sight, but their characters give us no real reason to believe so aside from making out whenever convenient. The ""horror"" elements come into play, making more of a metaphorical contribution, and give the film a unique experimental feel and dark tone. There are also a few scenarios that work their way in, not having any major relation to anything going on in the movie, that really had me not wanting to look away. I had a hard time putting my finger on this film. I didn't love jack and Diane, but at the same time it had me wanting to keep watching. As a unique and weird teenage romance, the film has a lot of cool things going on for it. But as a whole, it seemed kind of lost, not sure of which one of its features it wanted to pay the most attention to.Source: criticnic.com 3 April 2013Disclosure: Film sent by Magnolia Pictures","Cool concept, but missing a lot",1366502400,"04 21, 2013",3,0
"This film caught my eye when I was browsing my local Redbox for film choices. After reading the summary, I decided to rent it. It started off promising, with a interesting if a bit slow paced story. I was enjoying it, and the leading actor and actress did great jobs in their roles. Both of them are very pleasing on the eyes. Yummy.But near the end of the movie, Ondine's secret is revealed, and it is a big letdown. I liked this movie better when it had a feeling of magic to it, and the truth just feels like a cheap cop out, especially with the neatly wrapped up ending.

"Admittedly, I struggle with programs that I just don&#8217;t &#8216;get.&#8217;  I don&#8217;t mean that their meaning or plots or characters or themes escape me; rather, I don&#8217;t get how they uncover, hold, and reward an audience.  I know that my tastes as I&#8217;ve grown older have changed quite a bit in what I&#8217;ll accept in weekly dosage of television viewing, but why is it I have trouble turning my brain off with some series while I don&#8217;t with others?  In many cases, I tend to believe that, if the production qualities are high, then the writing, ideas, and characters should be equally compelling.  As is the case with a little something called HAVEN, that may not be the case &#8230; but why shouldn&#8217;t it be?(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you&#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I&#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you&#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &#8216;things to come,&#8217; then read on &#8230;)FBI Agent Audrey Parker (played by the lovely, fresh faced Emily Rose) came to Haven for the view, but she quickly found herself drawn into the local mysteries involving all things supernatural.  And why wouldn&#8217;t she?  Where else are you going to find alien abductions, dogs turning into people, haunted houses, and time travel all serving as local diversions?  As fate would have it, Parker is quick to learn that she might have vastly more to do with these local legends than anyone would&#8217;ve guessed!HAVEN is exactly the kind of programming made for today&#8217;s Syfy Channel (where it airs in the U.S.).  It&#8217;s filled with neato keen ideas, acceptable TV grade special effects, and actors who all look like underwear models.  I say that not meaning any of it as a slight; rather, it just seems tailor made to fit into a show designed to appeal to the much sought after youth demo who tend to be a bit more forgiving about what they&#8217;ll spend an hour (or 43 minutes without commercials) watching while happily germinating on the couch.In the 1990s, TWIN PEAKS was all the rage &#8230; well, for a short while, at least.  It tapped into some of the same underlying themes &#8211; i.e. small town life, local legends, nothing is quite what it seems, etc. &#8211; and, for the bulk of its two season run, it managed to eek out a fair share of stories bordering on cosmic coincidence and or plain spookiness.  HAVEN tramples on similar ground, albeit with much more expectable writing and less active posturing on the part of its players.  Each hour presents a single mystery; tinkers with its various circumstances enough to maintain the viewers&#8217; interest; and then most things are wrapped up within 60 minutes of TV time.  Its writers have cleverly incorporated their own ongoing mythology, but methinks all of those questions won&#8217;t be answered until the series&#8217; inevitable finale.  After all, all good things do come to an end, kids.The idea is based on the book by Stephen King published under the &#8216;Hard Case Crime&#8217; imprint, and it was called &#8220;The Colorado King.&#8221;  Here&#8217;s the dirty little secret: truth be told, King&#8217;s book wasn&#8217;t really all that good &#8211; it certainly wasn&#8217;t much of a mystery, not like the &#8216;Hard Case&#8217; books that had come before, but that didn&#8217;t stop editors from blazing ahead with a King novel hoping his name would spur sales.  &#8220;Kid&#8221; felt like a knock off, and I&#8217;ve no doubt some might say the same about HAVEN.Call it what you may, I found it pjazzable entertainment.  It didn&#8217;t tax me too much.  It showed me some pretty actors up against some pretty scenery.  And, after 60 minutes, I was free to go about my life looking for something with a bit more meat on its bones.HAVEN: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is produced by Entertainment One, Big Motion Pictures, Piller   Segan   Shepherd, Universal Networks International, and CanWest Global Television Network.  DVD distribution is being handled through Entertainment One (E One).  As for the technical specifications, this hourly sci fi lite drama is smartly produced, so it&#8217;s full of flawless sight and sound.  To its credit, this four disc set comes loaded with special features, including audio commentaries, a documentary, cast interviews, a Comic Con appearance, bloopers, and even more: well done to all participants because this is what fans love to see.RECOMMENDED.  It may not be for me, but it&#8217;s fine for thee if that&#8217;s your tastes.  For me, there was no better exploration of the eerie small town milieu than the oft maligned and equally misunderstood TWIN PEAKS; still, HAVEN has some respectable if not predictable charm.  Chalk that up to its good looking cast, its saccharin writing, and its tween ish romanticism.  No, it may not be perfect, but it&#8217;s a Syfy program, after all, so that bar is aptly set low.In the interests of fairness, I&#8217;m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Entertainment One (E One) provided me with a DVD copy of HAVEN: THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.","Quirky, Good-Looking Serial Is Decent If Unchallenging Entertainment",1383177600,"10 31, 2013",3,0

"Ti West's THE INNKEEPERS is an atmospheric ghost story, relying on character and low key shocks.

She plays coy and naivete well, but exaggerates many gestures and expressions in her more dramatic scenes.  Pat Healy as Luke is too one toned to incite any empathy.

"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:Al Capone and the Chicago Mob.  Lucky Luciano and the 5 Families in NYC.  Media has done a great job of illustrating organized crime in 2 of the 3 major US cities.  From Boardwalk Empire to Billy Bathgate, NYC and Chicago have been covered.  Much less is known about the early days of organized crime in LA.  While there was big budget production about Bugsy Siegel, it mainly covered his relationship with Virginia Hill and the construction of The Flamingo in Las Vegas.So kudos to TNT for taking on this project.  However, sometimes a good idea, simply does not result in good execution.  I wracked my brain to come up with the correct descriptor for why the production value didn't work for me.  Overly dramatic, not gritty, too staged?1.) Sid Rothman (Robert Knepper) is a fictional character.  Were there so few bad guys in LA in the 40's & 50's that for production value, one had to be made up?2.) While I generally like Edward Burns, I couldn't see him as a Jewish gangster.  Also, Siegel had what amounted to a 6th grade education and while he might have been suave, I can't imagine that he had much of a vocabulary3.) Ned Stax (Milo Ventimiglia) is another made up character and I have not generally liked Milo Ventimiglia in any of his prior roles4.) The violent scenes all came off as too stagedNoticeably absent from my commentary is John Bernthal as Detective Joe Teague.

Not much character development, not much plot.Edited to add: I just watched ""Journey to the Centre of the TARDIS,"" and nothing has changed. Boring. It's not the actors, it's the writing.

Before that, it played like just another disaster flick on the SciFi channel, predictable and too formulaic with stereotypical characters like the fugitive.  They really should have created a different character for Aldis Hodge because this is a waste of a huge talent, plus I hate seeing another brotha portrayed as a convict, whether he's innocent or not.  In fact, Aldis Hodge was the only reason why I watched this pilot, so that was disappointing.

"Feeling folksy?  If History's smash hit ""Pawn Stars"" is too urbane for you with its Las Vegas setting, you might want to try something with a little more twang.  ""Cajun Pawn Stars"" could be just that program, but I'm not sure if this version has quite the instant appeal.  I know there is a contingent of viewers who love this much more than the original, and I know there are vocal opponents who find this edition far less real and or compelling.  For myself, I fall somewhere in between.  The show is caught between being a rip off and a spin off.  It wants to adhere so closely to the winning formula that defined ""Pawn Stars"" that, especially in early episodes, the drama can seem incredibly forced.  As the season progresses and you get to know the cast, the interactions start to feel more organic  but it's still a show that has yet to find its own voice and viewpoint.Set in Alexandria, Louisiana at the Silver Dollar Pawn and Jewelry Center, the colorful proprietor is Jimmie ""Big Daddy"" DeRamus.  His brother and his daughter are among the other regulars and the show hopes to capitalize on wacky family interactions.  As you might expect, there is much down home humor to be gleaned from Big Daddy, his family, his staff, and those that visit the shop.  Some works, some feels strained.  To me, the star of the show (at least initially) is the mjazzive shop itself that seems to have every manner of merchandise crammed into its corners and crevices.  It would be a fascinating place to visit and poke through, that's for sure.Season One is comprised of 8 episodes on one disc for just shy of three hours worth of total programming.  There are no special features, but the disc offers Spanish and English subtitles.  Here are the included shows:(1) Donkeys and Dollars, (2) Sweet and Sour, (3) Shoeshine Mike, (4) Money Bzzzzness, (5) Joker's Big Score, (6) Trick or Trade, (7) Joker's Wild, and (8) Speed Demons.As I've said, the show seems to have divided people.  You might want to sample an episode on rerun before you buy the season (they are also available on demand here if you don't have the History Channel).  I love the shop, I haven't fallen in love with the show yet.  It has potential, though, as long as it keeps pushing to establish its own individuality.

We have yet to she why she is important, why she has a destiny, but I expect that will be answered in later episodes. Maybe.Unlike Touch, it has too many problems.

"I really want to like this pilot more since I seem to get hooked on most apocalyptic dramas, but despite the end of the world setting I just didn't get sucked in to the story introduced in the pilot.I would definitely like to see a couple more episodes just to see where the writer was going with the chaos in the pilot, but if the show doesn't make it to that point I will not be extremely surprised.  One thing that bothers me in particular is the choice to reveal all of the characters shared birthdays casually in the kitchen and then move on immediately.  The pacing in the pilot starts out well, but once they get out of the garage there is another episode or two of plot crammed in to the second half of the pilot.Also, the main character gets a huge steel gate dropped on her ankle and then gets trampled by a crowd but she seems to remain completely uninjured.  Why put her through trauma if she doesn't show any suffering?  I understand she is a strong female lead, and she is beautiful and French, but that wasn't enough for me to allow myself not to notice how she reacts to what she's supposed to be going through.Despite all of that I would still like to see a little bit more, because I get the feeling that the creators of the show have a sort of epic journey planned for future episodes.",Feels a little played out,1391731200,"02 7, 2014",3,0

"A friend of mind recommended The Office to me and swore I would love it.  I didn't.  It was much too awkward for me and I felt most of the humor was super dry.  (more so than the UK version at times)  So when another friend recommended Parks and Recreation, a comedy that breaks the 4th wall in the same way The Office did... I was apprehensive.  As it turns out, I happened to catch an episode from Season 2 randomly on TV and I was hooked.The first season is slow.  I won't lie, it's not nearly as funny as the second season.  Okay, honestly, it's not really that funny.  But you can see the potential, and it is only 6 episodes.  BUT!  Stick with it to Season 2.  Luckily this is where I started so I was able to give this show the chance it needed.  Watch Season 1 for the back stories, so you know about the running gags in the show, not so much for the humor.  Don't get me wrong, it is funny... in places, just not as good as it could be.

"As a movie, this film was heartwarming, as well as a tear jerker, no doubt about it. The acting was excellent, with the child actor who portrayed young Colton,; believable. However, if you're looking for &#34;factual&#34; information on NDE's (Near Death Experiences) and or, Scriptural proof of the existence of Heaven, I personally do not believe Heaven is for Real should be taken as absolute and complete evidence to support the movie's claim.The book with the same title, on the other hand, is a much more in depth and detailed ACCURATE account of 4 year old Colton; who had experienced an NDE only after he had DIED in the hospital after being several days with extremely high fever as  the poisonous toxins from of a ruptured appendix rushed throughout his little body. Also, the book adheres more to the truths that are found in Biblical Scripture.So, the bottom line: iIf you're looking for a feel good, have Kleenex handy type of film, then this is it.

"Mutant Chronicles(released Oct 08)stars Ron Perlman as Brother Samuel,John Malkovich as Constantine and Thomas Jane as Sgt.Hunter.While watching it,I could not help but see the resemblance to a video game,which came out a year later,called Necromancer,which had the same kind of plot and setting.The plot finds Earth cordoned off into global pockets by big corporations in the year 2707.Each area is fighting the other for supremacy over resources.The soldiers and battles look like WW1,involving alot of trench warfare.The armaments however are retro futuristic which betray its`older look.A back story explains that 10,000 years before an alien machine landed on earth and tried to devolve humanity into something of its own making;mutants.Mankind then got the upper hand and buried the machine far below ground and sealed it up.Well,the on going battles above have finally broken the seal and soldiers are becoming mutants once more.They are attacking any side they can.However the non mutant soldiers believe their opponents are responsible for the horrors being slowly unleashed.By the time they figure it out Earth is in great danger.An ancient order dedicated to preserving the memory of the machine and how to defeat it if it should ever pose a threat to mankind again,comes to the fore.Earth turns its hopes to them in order to save itself.The leader of the order,Brother Samuel,leads a small band of men and women to the bowels of the earth,through ancient buildings and shafts.During the entire time they must battle mutants constantly.Once they reach the machine,those that are left dwindle down even more until there is only one man left standing.He unlocks the secret which sends the machine flying back into space.The final fadeout shows the ship in vast space with Mars to the right.Most of humanity has left Earth to colonize Mars,so will the ship fly into unknown regions or follow humanity to become a terrible threat again?The plot does become involved but not too much so as to leave one scratching ones head.This is an effects driven movie,instead of preferably being the other way around.Ron Perlman does well as the Irish Brother Samuel.Malkovich doesn't have a big part but he makes the most of what he has.Thomas Jane takes most of the lead here as a tough sergeant who has been through hell and back in the wars,and ends up following the team Brother Samuel leads.Overall,I found the pace can be slow at times,so the constant stop starting can get tedious.Other than that there is just not enough to really put this movie head and shoulders above average.It is not really bad but it is not really good either.Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w s a r of 1:85:1.Other than the trailer,that is all you get.All in all just a fair to middling film about an alien machine rising once more to create a mutant race of all mankind.The acting is good,and the plot interesting,but not enough to render it anything but average.",An average futuristic film?,1346371200,"08 31, 2012",3,0

Sorry, to any fans of theirs, but if they played their roles better, the characters might have been a bit more interesting and allowed this viewer to want to know what happens to them next.I truly wanted to rate this higher, just because the idea behind the story was so darn intriguing, but I can't.

"I tend to watch a lot of off beat and non mainstream movies. When you do this, you'll come across as much garbage as there was in the trash compactor scene in the original STAR WARS. However, every once in a while you'll uncover a gem. Sometimes, you'll uncover a really unusual movie that's really not all that great, but is so unusual that the very oddity and absurdity of it makes it stand out and worth watching through. RUBBER is one of those movies.RUBBER is a movie about a killer tire. The film opens with a man (Jack Plotnick) standing out in the middle of the desert covered in binoculars. Then a car comes driving up a dirt road destroying a bunch of wooden chairs that have been set up as though they were orange safety cones. The car stops and a man in a police uniform (Stephen Spinella) gets out and begins talking into the camera. He gives a long monologue about in every great movie there is an element of something happening for ""no reason"" and that's what this movie is all about. He then dumps out the beverage in his hand and jumps back into the car and is driven off. Then the man with the binoculars begins pjazzing out binoculars to a group of spectators standing behind roped off pillars. The people take their binoculars and turn around and begin watching the movie. Throughout the rest of the film RUBBER moves back and forth between the action of Robert the Tire and the audience. Towards the end of the movie, the audience actually becomes a part of the movie.So, with the absurdist theatre element in place, the main ""action"" follows the deeds of Robert the Tire. It's never explained in the movie how or why (and Robert isn't even given a name, except in the special features and in promotional materials) Robert comes to be. He just rises out of the dirt and is. It takes him some time to get adjusted to just standing up and then rolling around of his own accord. But soon he's off and rolling. Then he comes across a plastic bottle in his way and he flattens it. Next a scorpion in his way meets the same fate. However, the next object is a gljazz bottle and Robert can't flatten that. This seems to upset him so tries to destroy it with his mind and succeeds in making it explode. So, now Robert is a living tire who has a type of pyrokinesis, he can't make things explode with his mind. Robert quickly moves from exploding bottles to exploding living things.In some ways RUBBER is a critique at the way Hollywood and the studios usually make movies. It's an insane process that doesn't make any sense to most people and often even confounds those in the movie business. I know there are countless times I've left a film thinking, ""How did they get to make that?!"" RUBBER pokes fun of that and the way that most people are just there to watch a good show. Yet, that pjazzivity can make us animals. But, don't read too much into that. RUBBER is, after all, a movie about a killer tire.",This Rubber is Vulcanized,1332028800,"03 18, 2012",3,0

"Director documentarian Werner Herzog jazzembles a small film crew to explore a recently discovered cave in southern France.  The cave is unique in that large, ornate wall art was found dating back more than 30,000 years.  Twice as old as any others found.  The government only allows scientists of various stripes into the cave and for relatively brief periods.  There are several arrays of drawings, but it doesn't take 90 minutes to see them, so Herzog adds some interesting interviews with archeologists, art historians and the like.  One of the young Frenchman is particularly interesting, especially telling one story of how Australian Aborigines felt about cave art.A beautiful musical score is layered across the film which certainly adds a reverent quality.  In fact, the score was recorded in an ancient church.  There is a ""special feature"" that documents all this on the Blu ray disc.  Ultimately, I was left with a lot of unanswered questions.  What material was used to produce the paintings?  Why are only animals depicted?  Why are there no trees, mountains...or people?

"While the show Jo B and G Raff is cute, it is not very educational. The pilot episode focuses on Jo B looking for his friend G Raff who has gone swimming under the sea. G Raff tells Jo B that he doesn't want to do the show yet because he is exploring the sea. Jo B decides to go find G Raff. This is when Jo B asks the children what he can use to go into the water. I was under the impression that this would be the first learning scene. Instead, the problem solving question was rushed and lacking. Jo B goes to a train, then states an airplane won't work. Jo B finally spots the answer which is the submarine. There is a lack of interacting from kids watching and the characters on the show. If I was the writer, I would have placed the words on the screen and asked questions. For example, bring forward the airplane with it spelling beside it and then ask ""will an airplane get us under the sea?"" Once the answer is selected through interaction with the characters, the writers should have taught the kids watching how to pronounce Submarine.The main lesson for the pilot is compromise. I had an issue with this because rather than it being a compromise, it felt like G Raff was pressuring Jo B. PEER PRESSURE! Jo B wants to go back and start the show but G Raff wants him to stay. Wouldn't it have been better if a third party told Jo B and G Raff to host the show under water? I understand the lesson is compromise, but it was poorly executed in the writing.My final complaint ties into the first complaint that the show is not very educational. Be honest parents. All I heard over and over again was It's the Jo B and G Raff show. They repeat that way too many times. I understand they want to hook children to those names, but they needed something educational rather than repeating names.

"Too much crap about demons. It's called ghost adventures, not let's see if we can get possessed by demons adventures. I sometimes like the dramatizations, and when they go wandering around a town talking to people it is entertaining, but so many times it takes up half the show. They also tend to make wild jazzumptions about things.","sometimes annoying, but i still find them entertaining",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",3,0

"&#8220;Redemption&#8221; (also known as &#8220;Hummingbird&#8221;) stars Jason Statham as a former Special Forces coming back from Afghanistan, but those who are expecting something like the &#8220;Transporter&#8221; series would be disappointed with the crime drama set in today&#8217;s underground London. The brooding film is more like a character study, following the story of Joseph Smith (Statham), a veteran who goes AWOL, currently living in London as a homeless.Joseph is given a chance to start over his life, when he enters an apartment room of someone who is now away from home. He then starts working for Mr. Choy (Benedict Wong), a crime lord who is involved in human trafficking. In the meanwhile, he attempts to use his newly gained power to do the right things. The film also follows the relationship between Joseph and a nun Cristina (Agata Buzek), which is the most unique aspect of the film.So, in &#8220;Redemption&#8221; Jason Statham shows what he can do as an actor. Though personally I prefer to watch another &#8220;Transporter&#8221; sequel, I think he did a decent job. But, while &#8220;Redemption&#8221; benefits from Chris Menges&#8217; moody photography, the film itself lacks rhythm, suffering from the flat narrative.Probably &#8220;Redemption&#8221; will be remembered as Steven Knight&#8217;s debut work as director. Knight has been known for his screenplays for &#8220;Dirty Pretty Things&#8221; and &#8220;Eastern Promises.&#8221; In a sense &#8220;Redemption&#8221; may be called the third film of his &#8220;London underworld trilogy&#8221; and is the least effective one.","Crime Thriller and Debut Work of Steven Knight, Writer of &#8220;Dirty Pretty Things&#8221; and &#8220;Eastern Promises&#8221;",1404172800,"07 1, 2014",3,0

"I heard the book was better but I found the documentary somewhat engaging. They talked about incentives, how names that were hot are now for the lower working cljazzes, cheating, why crime has dropped and so forth. The most interesting part to me was about how names that were for the upper cljazzes have since dropped to the lower middle cljazzes and also whether your name can affect your economic life. I had expected more interesting tidbits so what I expected to be excellent turned out to be only somewhat good. WHEN WATCHED: late August 2011; MY GRADE: B minus.",WORTH A LOOK BUT I HEAR THE BOOK IS BETTER,1315353600,"09 7, 2011",3,0
This is a film about the relationships of people and how they unknowingly are interconnected in ways that in some cases they will never truly understand. The movie jumps from country to country and person to person throughout the storyline and in some way they are all connected with each other and usually it involves a sexual relationship of themselves or their partner.  The film features an all star cast of international movie stars but even such an honor roll of stars could not save this movie.The movie presentation is choppy and the directing is done in the same manner.  The storyline drags in the first half of the movie and it is 40 minutes before Anthony Hopkins makes his first appearance. After Hopkins shows up the film gets gradually better but still not spectacular.  The script and storyline are just generic and no real plot ever develops during the movie.  It is just bland and the film just seemed flat and uninspired.My wife and I still rated it a 3 star presentation but many people will not like it.  The film was better in the second half but it only raised it from a 1.5 to a 3 star rating.  I am not sure that I can truly recommend this film and if I were you I would rent it and not buy the DVD.,An interesting concept but the presentation seemed choppy and uninspired!,1359244800,"01 27, 2013",3,0
