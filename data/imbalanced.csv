"This was a very engaging pilot and is seems to be Slings & Arrows for the symphony. The characters were believable and story was solid. The only issue I had was that it was clear there were actors faking playing their instruments. While I could see past that, I could see where musicians would cry foul. If you are investing this much money in a program and striving for excellence, it should be as authentic as possible. Follow the example of Treme and really ensure you either employ actors who play or employ musicians that can act. Faking it will only cheapen your product.",Very well produced program that needs some help in the music department,1392768000,"02 19, 2014",4,1

I love watching this show.  The acting is good and the mysteries are always interesting.  For some reason Amazon has discontinued seasons 1 11.

"H2O reminded me of Flipper and Gidget from the 1960s.  The plots ran to sibling rivalry, fights with each other and boyfriends, misunderstandings, embarrjazzments, and the joy of swimming and playing in the water.

"I was disappointed in Season 3   too much mob _ _ _ _, But here we are kicking and playing with the U.S. Marshals again.  Next to Raylan Givens, Boyd Crowder is great fun ! ! ! Southern KY is always a rockin'.  I am excited when I see characters from &#34;Deadwood&#34; pop up on Justified.  Jim Beaver is one of TVs enjoyable characters from Deadwood to Supernatural and on to bits in Dexter, The Middle, The Mentalist and he was really great in Harper's Island   Very cool actor !  Timothy Olyphant had a singular role in Deadwood.  I just didn't think he would be able to pull out another strong character in Justified.  But he has done very well and he makes this show a number one hit.  . . .Who else do I remember that he brought back into Justified from Deadwood  oh yeah the preacher from Deadwood had a bit role at some point in Justified . . . and Gerald McRaney (he got shot in Justified, astonishing I know.) . . . . Maybe that is all   I can't remember any others but it is possible there are more.  Regardless   Justified has a heavy hitting cast !  Season 4 has FIVE STARS for me.",Timothy Olyphant comes back Swinging !,1371686400,"06 20, 2013",5,1

"In my opinion I have the best opinions in this world.In my opinion I know value and quality when I see it.This interview was easily the best interview of any human ever recorded.  Not because of the questions (which were good), but because Steve Jobs shows us in under 80 minutes why he was the most inspired man of the computer age.I will be hard pressed to ever give 5 stars again because for any movie or book on Amazon to measure up to this it would be a masterpiece.Anything less than 5 stars for this show is ignorant, being the 12th reviewer I plan on returning to see if anyone has a beef with this and why, because to me it was awesome and very very inspiring.",My first and best review,1355702400,"12 17, 2012",5,1

"I was first introduced to the Robert Durst mystery on an episode of TV's AMERICAN JUSTICE and was both fascinated and disgusted with this miscarriage of justice.  But power, politics and money can certainly overcome the truth.ALL GOOD THINGS changes the names but retains the bizarre facts or probabilities of this still unsolved mystery.  What happened to David Marks (Durst's) lovely young bride?  Who killed his longtime author friend?  Was the death of his new buddy really in self defense?  After new evidence surfaced in the late 2000's, the writers of ALL GOOD THINGS offers some truly evocative  and credible  solutions.I was truly impressed with this movie.  Its use of voice over narrative is tastefully used and moves the plot along.  While the main thrust of the film focuses on David and Kathy's stormy marriage, the script accommodates the related crimes quite efficiently.And what a cast!  Ryan Gosling is marvelous as the multi layered David  charming, volatile, manipulative, haunted and ultimately dangerous.  Kirsten Dunst's Oscar worthy performance as Kathy is devastating.  In her best performance to date, she inhabits the role with overwhelming depth.  Her tragic descent is captured in every facial expression and her desperate pleadings.  She's every bit as good as Rachel Portman's award winning BLACK SWAN.Add Frank Langella's self serving father, Lily Rabe's authot and Philip Baker Hall as Marks' doomed roomie and you have a brilliant cast.Roger Ebert called ALL GOOD THINGS one of 2010's best films and I concur.",OVERLOOKED GEM,1309651200,"07 3, 2011",5,1
You really never know what Jason's ultra ego will do while he is asleep. There have only been a few shows but so far its pretty entertaining. He is good Dr. by day and party animal at night.

"Early Roman history has never interested me much, but this series is so well done that I found myself entranced and inspired to find out what was truth and what of it was pure fiction!  Anything that can wisk you back in time, capitvate your whole mind space so that finishing the story is almost an obsession and inspire you to desire to know even more is undoubtably a triumph!  There are moments of....well, extremely adult content to put it delicately....that would or at least might not set well with parents of young impressionable children, but otherwise, this is historical fiction of the highest quality!",History fictionalized -- at it's very most captivatingly well told!,1402358400,"06 10, 2014",5,1
"Haha, Jim Bob didn't break his good ol' boy smile when he disarmed the ""samurai"" who wanted to ""date"" the Duggar Girls. LOLAnd the little girls started crying when they saw their big sisters turned into ""geisha.""This is even more enjoyable if you caught the last regular episode before these Asia episodes when Jim Bob had a bible study session that coincidentally was about how it's better to be simply garbed and not evil and certainly in the Japanese episodes, the Duggars' old fashioned garb contrasted greatly with their surroundings.During the slaughter of the Duggar males scene, it may remind some people of the Japanese mjazzacres of Caucasian missionary families in Borneo BEFORE the formal declaration of war.Those murders were remembered by the local Dayak tribespeople and affected their decision to ally with downed Allied airmen as documented inAirmen and the Headhunters  narrated by Liev Schreiber in his NEUTRAL Narrator voice   very unSabretooth.","""Hi, I'm Jim Bob.

"The final season of The Office was very good, in my opinion.Gone was Robert California. Also, the absence of Ed Helms due to other projects (I guess) was ver well handled.There were some very good ideas, like the documentary crew appearing in some scenes (one of them protecting Pam from being attacked).The extras are very good, showing some audition, blooper reel, etc.All in all, one of the best shows I've ever watched.","A pleasant, honest and satisfactory ending",1383955200,"11 9, 2013",4,1

"Grimm takes a new perspective on fairytales.  Actually, if you ever read the original Grimm Brothers, this may be more truth than fiction.  (Just kidding)  But, the mixture of policeman + Grimm works well.  I love the transformation of people into the fable characters.  The weekly episodes are stand alone, yet there is a deeper story line throughout the seasons.  This makes it good if you are just trying it out.  This makes it great if you are an avid follower.  I love the idea and the delivery.  Good job!","Nibble, nibble little mouse...who is nibbling at my house?",1383436800,"11 3, 2013",5,1
"Several youngish couples gather for a regular Sunday brunch with the one unattached woman in the group bringing along a new boyfriend. Meanwhile, several dirty bombs have been dropped on the city and America is under attack.Such is the premise for this black comedy which mocks the mating and social habits of thirty something suburbanites trying to maintain viable and interesting long term relationships and marriages while beset by triviality and boredom. The movie is well written and well acted and often very funny. Despite the cosmic events going on outside the duct taped semi detatched where all the action takes place, these couples remain fixated on their indiscretions and infidelities.Another couple who always show up late are refused admission and left to die on the doorstep. &#34;You're so inconsiderate. You never come on time. People cook food to be eaten hot and you never come on time,&#34; the Julia Stiles character tells her friend outside who is breathing nerve gas.The new boyfriend turns out to be a scary Christian fundamentalist. The ditzy new age vegan woman is just as shallow as she seems. The nerdy one who buys comic books on e bay is convinced aliens are attacking.

Excellent casting as well, I was not sold on Rhys Myers at first, but he has proved to be very adept for this role, as well as all his fellow cast members.

"2012PG: Every once in a great while we meet someone who makes us want to ""sit taller in the saddle"". If you're one of those people you'll enjoy this story of an old writer who's lost his reason for living then finds it in the dream of another (won't spoil the story) while searching for it in the bottom of a bottle. It's a cold heart that can't find warmth in a story about real people with real feelings. Redemption of self can take many forms the favorite of which may be to ""never stop looking for what's not there"".

"Some of the plot lines are silly, dependent on people acting within a very narrow range of actions. The love story is drawn out and awkward. The lead is kind of charming, and like all detective stories theses days, a maverick genius with his own set of values. It's still a fun show to watch. My favorite episodes were with the old lead detective.","It's fun, don't overthink it",1399852800,"05 12, 2014",4,1
"As a series that honors its origins without ever being merely imitative of them, this may well turn out to be one of the all time great television spin offs. Indeed, the very term ""spin off"" seems somehow inadequate. For this is a true sequel, and one fully up to the task of standing on equal terms with its predecessor.A lifetime has pjazzed between the ending of Avatar and the beginning of Korra, and in that time the world of the four nations has moved on. Even during the scope of the original series, we saw that world in a state of technological ferment. In the time between the two series, this process has clearly marched on unabated. By the time Korra begins, we find ourselves in a world with technology comparable to early 20th century Earth.To those who fell in love with the world of the first series, I'd say only this: don't worry, for there is nothing to fear here. The  writers have not destroyed or replaced their original creation. Rather, they have profoundly deepened it. There is the sense of a real world with its own internal logic and course of development   a world that changes precisely because of its own reality. Integral to this is the fact that it's not just the technology that has moved forwards. Everything from the society's economic basis to its martial arts has changed since last we were here, but always in logical and internally consistent ways. You can tell that this is a show made by people with a deep respect for the integrity of their own creation.As with the original series, this logical and consistent quality   this ability to just plain think things through   applies not only to the world building, but also to the plot and story. At all times we have the sense of a tapestry being woven. Even when we don't quite know where all the threads are heading, or what dark warp in the weave is yet to surface, we  instinctively know that _something_ is happening. Something we can't help but get caught up in and want to follow.Fittingly for an animated show, the world, the story, and all its many moods are communicated to us in large part through the art. At all times we know we're in the same world we were first introduced to in the original Avatar series. There are no sharp breaks here. However, in keeping with the early 20th century feel of this new era, the coloring is significantly more subdued. On a concrete level this manifests in such details as the sepia hues of early photography and the drabness of industrial landscapes. But it is also used to convey the sense that the world we are visiting is now a murkier place, one where the true nature of the threats faced is significantly less clear than it was in the original series. It is a tempting if imperfect metaphor to cast this show asThe Empire Strikes Backof the Avatar universe.I also find that I cannot let this review go by without mentioning the background music. As with the original series, this is composed by Jeremy Zuckerman and Benjamin Wynn, and is once again superb. It is both beautiful in its own right and integral to how the show's creators communicate with us as an audience. It speaks to us of the nature of the world we find ourselves in, of the story we are following, and again, of all the many moods that this story takes. And it not only speaks: it speaks eloquently.There is so much more to say here, but I'm going to cut myself down to two final observations.First, Andrea Romano, whom I shall forever think of asHawkgirl, lends her considerable talents to the voice direction. One never knows quite how much credit should go to a director and how much to the actors. But when everyone just plays off each other perfectly, you've got to figure that a significant slice of the credit should go to the director. Props to you, Andrea.Second, one of the things I've loved the most about this series is how, in the character of Avatar Korra, we do have the sense that at the core, this is the same person we were first introduced to as Avatar Aang: even though that person is now manifesting through a very different personality.This is far and away the best thing Nickelodeon has done in years. It is the kind of show that both children and adults can enjoy. But unlike so many shows that wind up being described in such terms, it is not ""multi layered"" in the straightforward sense that there are some things that the less sophisticated viewers will miss entirely. Rather, its generation spanning appeal stems from far more basic strengths: a well thought out story, real emotional depth, and compelling characters; to say nothing of meticulous world building coupled with wonderfully lyrical art and background music.That, in the end, is why both children and adults will love The Legend of Korra.Theo.",A Worthy Successor,1350000000,"10 12, 2012",5,1

"My hubs loved the HBO series Deadwood. I couldn't get past the gratuitous cursing. Not that I am opposed or without sin but it was too much. I went on to enjoy its star, Timothy Elophant , in Justified. Cause..cowboy in tight jeans, bad boy vibe. Not the best TV, but something I could watch with hubs. Hell on Wheels is exceptional TV. Yes, it is gory, and there are whores and cursing..but in the amount that likely reflects the time period. There is great character evolvement..and acts of compjazzion and love that balance the whole tawdry feel. An excellent study of racial tension, hardship, struggle for dominion over the West, and yes, a handsome, (albeit grubby) cowboy in jeans.

"The series premiere thrusts viewers right into the thick of things, as firefighter Andy Darden has just been killed in the line of duty. Both Casey and Severide blame one another, and the death has rocked the confidence and morale of 51 in general. Meanwhile, Casey finds himself the target of a dirty cop's wrath after Casey refuses to cover for the officer's son in a drunk driving accident that left another person paralyzed.There's never a dull moment, either professionally or personally, at Chicago's Firehouse 51. Led by Lieutenants Matt Casey (Jesse Spencer) and Kelly Severide (Taylor Kinney), under the direction of Chief Wallace Boden (Eamonn Walker), the firefighters at 51 are called to the scene for everything from apartment fires to train derailments to gang crossfire.Rounding out the crew at 51 are also paramedics Gabriela Dawson (Monica Raymund) and Leslie Shay (Lauren German); experienced firefighters Christopher Herrmann (David Eigenberg), Joe Cruz (Joe Minoso), &#34;Otis&#34; (Yuri Sardarov) and &#34;Mouch&#34; (Christian Stolte), as well as candidate trainee Peter Mills (Charlie Barnett). The group frequently interacts with Dawson's brother, Det. Antonio Dawson (Jon Seda). a narcotics investigator who is often the means of gaining crucial information from the police department.On a personal level, Casey and his longtime girlfriend, Dr. Hallie Thomas (Teri Reeves) struggle to reconcile their differences regarding children, while Severide tries to hide a serious injury that is impacting his ability to do his job properly. Dawson struggles with her longtime crush on Casey; Cruz discovers his younger brother is part of a gang. Mills is anxious to become a full fledged firefighter, following in the footsteps of his father who was killed on the job, while his mother is desperate to change his mind.And those are just a FEW of the longer running storylines! In just this first season, viewers are also regaled with a character's mother being paroled from prison (for killing his father); pregnancies, gang activity, traumatic brain injury, and numerous near death experiences of various kinds. Many of these stories are introduced as rather intense, but so quickly resolved that it truly takes away from how well the story is told. Or, even worse, some of the stories are introduced, indicated as extremely pertinent to the character(s)...and then dropped, never to be heard about again. Almost moments later, the next crisis hits 51, and the next, and the next.Fortunately, the show seems to find a better pace toward the end of the first season, and definitely from the start of Season 2. This way, viewers can more fully enjoy and appreciate the storytelling, as well as the character development, than when it's all rushing past like the men to the scene of a fire.","Terrific show, but took a bit to find its groove...",1391558400,"02 5, 2014",5,1
"The writing, characters, acting and direction on both Seasons 1 and 2 of ""Justified"" are top shelf. Not only does Mr. Olyphant nail his character but the excellent supporting actors comprise a truly impressive ensemble.  While the plots can be convoluted and somewhat melodramatic and predictable, it's so much fun watching and listening to these folks interact and play off each other that you hardly notice.  With the right mix of drama, action, rednecks and highly intelligent and strong women ""Justified"" pretty much punches its own ticket.I was originally quite wary of the accents and setting, wrongly thinking it a cross between My Name is Earl and Miami Vice, but it's carved a truly original niche of its own.  Impressive and eminently watchable. Margo Martindale in Season 2 is pretty frightening and one of the sleaziest female characters in the history of TV.

"I would rate &#34;Justified&#34; with 4 1 2 stars if I could, but it is very close to perfection for me.  Interesting, quirky characters, action, suspense, and plenty of humor (although usually very dark).  I have to give most of the credit to the writers, but the acting by the entire cast is top notch.  Timothy Olyphant (Raylan) and Walton Goggins (Boyd) are incredible to watch, especially in the scenes they share together.  Jere Burns, as Wynn Duffy, turns in another great rendition of his signature creepy psychopath.  It's the eyes: even when he's not supposed to be creepy, he just is. Margo Martindale is exceptional (as always) in her role of Mags Bennett.  I've never seen a female villain quite like her.  She somehow manages to be sympathetic, which is very difficult to do.I would highly recommend &#34;Justified&#34; to anyone who enjoys character driven drama or action suspense mixed with the right amount of unconventional humor.

"I LOVE this show!!!  I recently discovered this show and have since seen all 6 seasons and I absolutely love this show.  Personally, I've had my fill of reality tv but this show is the exception.  The contestants are truly gifted and the judges are genuinely qualified to judge the contestants creations (all judges are either employed in the entertainment industry or are actors.  Several judges have earned Oscars for their past work).  Additionally, the contestants (even though some are in their early 20's) behave professionally throughout the show.  Only a couple of times have contestants engaged in backbiting or arguing and with the exception of Season 1 contestant Frank, who behaved like a total jerk but eventually redeemed himself on Season 5 All Stars, they have refrained from showboating and excessive partying.  When a contestant needs help, the others pitch in.  During one episode, a contestant had to go to the hospital because of an injury.  While he was gone, his fellow contestants worked on his molds so that he wouldn't be left without a costume for the reveal.  When the winner is announced, I am never disappointed because the finalists are so talented and deserving.  My favorite part of each episode occurs during the reveal when the finished product is morphed onto the model's natural face.  It is amazing what these artists can complete in only three days time and makes me appreciate the work that special effects makeup artists perform in my favorite TV shows and movies all the more.  This show is a winner all around and is definitely appropriate for all ages.",absolutely amazingly talented artists,1399075200,"05 3, 2014",5,1

"If you are shopping Season Five of History's engaging docu series ""Ice Road Truckers,"" it's fair to jazzume that you are already a fan. Since its debut in 2007, the show has provided big ratings for the network and its popularity has helped to restructure the entire network's programming slate. You know the drill. For two months a year, big rig hauling over the tundra is necessary to supply remote outposts before the eventual thaw. It's a dangerous profession as we're informed on EACH and EVERY episode. After five years, I think we get it! In truth, everything that you need to know about the job specifics of ice road trucking was covered long ago. The show's success now firmly rests on its cast of characters who can be both likable and somewhat abrasive.The 16 episodes that comprise this 4 disc set bring you the latest antics of Hugh, Alex, Lisa and Rick as well as many others in the profession. If you like the show, obviously this is an easy recommendation. My personal thought is that we've pretty much covered every topic conceivable in the last five seasons and I'm not as enthusiastic about the show as I was several years ago. I'm obviously in the minority, however, as viewership when it aired on History rose 30% between the fourth and fifth seasons. And am I the only one that gets exhausted by narrator Thom Beers?Here's a break down of the episodes: The product description proclaims that there are 15 episodes, but there are 16 in total for the season.(1) Pushing the Edge, (2) Ice Road Rage, (3) Wrong Turn & Burned, (4) Fire on Ice, (5) Under the Hammer, (6) The Braking Point, (7) A Banged Up Job, (8) Meltdown!, (9) Road to Nowhere, (10) Rookie Rebellion, (11) Hittin' The Skids, (12) No More Mr. Nice Guy, (13) Ice Rogue Trucker, (14) The Heat Is On, (15) Judgement Day, and (16) The Last Dash.Although not offered on Blu ray, the video quality on this presentation is solid. For enthusiasts, the set does include bonus footage. It didn't add a lot to the experience for me, but some of it is fun to check out.

"This show at first looked a bit laughable to me, but I jazzure you this is a well conceived series. All the actors have been chosen with great care, and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives. They have great chemistry in every scene, it's like they're best friends in real life. The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling. What I love about the show is it's many references to movies, television, and video games. Chuck is not James Bond, not even close in fact. It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage. He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him. Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend (lucky guy), and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team. It's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah's relationship grow throughout the season. They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments. It's sorta like on LOST with Jack and Kate you know they want to be with each other but the plot dictates otherwise just teasing you here and there. Chuck also has a best friend Morgan who is responsible for most of the laughs as we watch his pathetic life, and the way he clings to Chuck's every move. Chuck and his family really keep the show grounded and really relatable to the every day guy. This show began well and only got better in season 2.The picture quality is another thing all together. It has grain in almost every frame. The picture is just filled with noise almost the entire time. It really is distracting and is quite disappointing. Chuck surpjazzes the picture quality with it's amazing characters and stories. The extras are decent with some deleted scenes, a gag reel, and audition footage.  The series is a mix of Alias, Mission Impossible, and Get Smart. It is the ultimate comedy hour mixed with great action.",A nerds ultimate fantasy.,1262649600,"01 5, 2010",5,1

"This is a great crime dramedy featuring Nathan Fillion who we all know from Firefly! If you're old enough to remember, I have to liken Castle to a blend of &#34;Moon Lighting&#34;, &#34;Columbo&#34;, and &#34;Murder She Wrote&#34;. I am now officially in mourning however as we're flying through the seasons. My wife and I tend to watch a few episodes a day and before we know it, we'll be caught up and stuck waiting a week for each new episode! ACK!!!!  This is definitely the worst issue when it comes to finding shows that have been on for a few seasons when you discover them.  You become spoiled watching several episodes in a sitting and when you catch up and are forced to wait a whole week (or more) for a new episode... ugg!The 30 second gist of the show is that Fillion is a crime writer who gets connected with an attractive detective and manages to convince the mayor (who Castle is friends with) that he should have unrestricted access to follow her around for inspiration. He's also a huge jazzet to the NYPD with his understanding of criminal behavior etc. Fillion is great and there is lots of comic relief surrounding the central murder plot so it's not a real downer to watch. Season five continues to refine the chemistry between Beckett and Castle and their relationship is always in flux with lots of tension and humor. For the most part, you can jump around between episodes and not watch them in order. It seems that there are usually 4 or 5 episodes in each season that move the greater story arc plot along. The other shows, while equally fantastic, focus elusively on the murder of the day and not Becket or Castle's past.  This season is no exception to the rule and there are some major developments in the primary story arc.As of the time of this writing, they are into Season 6. We just started watching about two months ago, ripped through season 1   4 and just wrapped up 5. Owning them on Amazon is the way to go, commercial free and easy to watch on pretty much any internet connected device, not to mention binge watching multiple episodes back to back makes for nice unwind time after the kids are fast asleep!

"This devious little thriller simply *must* be seen. But you should know what you're NOT getting, in order to avoid disappointment.I had seen only the trailer and good reviews on Amazon. I was expecting more of an action y British gangster film. But it's not really an action film    although MUCH happens    and that's a *good* thing. It is devilishly suspenseful.The first ten minutes are masterful. They quickly becoming horrifyingly suspenseful    totally without dialogue. (The first line of dialogue is said at approx 6 min in.) That sounds boring, but it is the exact opposite: riveting. The story begins, and you must pay attention. The more attention you pay, the more compelling it becomes. This is *not* a movie to have on in the background while you clear off the kitchen table or do dishes. (My boyfriend does this all the time. It drives me nuts because he'll say, ""Eh, I didn't think [insert movie title] was that good"" and I'll say, ""Well, you really didn't watch it, you mostly had your back to it!"" And then when I make him sit down and watch movies I've liked, he'll say, ""I totally didn't get that the first time I saw it"" and I'm like, ""Yeah, 'cause you didn't *see* it!!"" Argh.)This is a movie to make popcorn for and sit down to really *watch*    don't answer your phone, don't play with your tablet, make sure any kids are in bed and can't disturb you.The actions of the two men in preparation to commit a serious crime heighten the suspense. The supplies they gather are curious, then intriguing, then horrifying in their implications. The spaces in which they work are large with wide camera angles. Over time, throughout the film, both the spaces and camera angles slowly shrink, adding a visual claustrophobia to the psychological tension as the film progresses.The soundtrack is like a fourth character (and I'd like to buy it). It never gives things away, but alternates setting the mood with punctuating the plot twists and shifting dynamics. Pure music    synthesizer based modern sounds alternating with haunting organic notes of solo viola or cello    evokes moods and heightens the emotion of unexpected twists, moments of pathos, shifts of alliance. It doesn't use pop music to buttress lousy chemistry or muddy action.This movie is not what the trailer implies. Truly unexpected plot twists alternate with slow reveals of the relationship dynamics, character back stories (without flashbacks), and shifting alliances. Every time I thought I knew what would happen, who the characters were, what they were about to do    I was wrong. As a jaded and cynical movie fan, and tired of predictable, cliche ish, dumbed down movies, I found this movie fiendishly fun to try to figure out    and I never really succeeded.Gemma Arterton's Alice is integral to the plot. She does a great job, she definitely holds her own    but she by no means carries the film by herself, as the Amazon summary says. It's truly an ensemble, albeit a small one of only three people. The two male leads were gripping to watch. Eddie Marsan is amazing as Vic. (He was Inspector Lestrade from Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes reboots; he was also in two of the Channel 4 Red Ridings, and in the BBC's Little Dorrit). Vic's evolution is unexpected, believable, brilliantly done, and (by the end) surprisingly sympathetic. Martin Compston was new to me (I never watched Monarch of the Glen). But he's fantastic as the (initially) inexplicably conflicted Danny, seemingly one down in the criminal partnership. In fact, the acting by both male leads is so good, your sympathy shifts back and forth from the obviously sympathetic victim character Alice to the two males, who initially are totally unsympathetic (because you think you know who they are and what they're about to do).The Disappearance of Alice Creed is not a ""big"" film with crashing violence and lots of guns and explosions. It's one of those films where the implied violence is almost as devastating as the violence that *is* committed. Like David Cronenberg's films, when violence or action occurs in this film, it *means* something: it has consequences    it's not just there for vicarious and bloodless audience thrills. And although this movie fraks with you, it's not a conventional mind frak movie, either. It's definitely a psychological thriller.Don't view this movie expecting Sexy Beast or In Bruges or a Guy Ritchie movie    or even Layer Cake, with which it has some kinship psychologically and perhaps morally (but it never tries to be as consciously cool as Layer Cake). The Disappearance of Alice Creed has more in common thematically with the Coen Brothers' Blood Simple or No Country For Old Men, or with Carl Franklin's thriller One False Move. It's deadly serious about itself and that pays off in how unique and authentic the plot and characters feel. It's up to you whether you find the ending uplifting or bleak, a morality tale or an inevitability.WARNING: Stick through the first half hour forty minutes, even if it looks feels like it's about to become cheap Hollywood torture porn. It isn't. It's a much better and smarter film than that. By smart, I do not mean clever like a Guy Ritchie film is clever. (Not that there is anything wrong with that: I love Ritchie's films.) I mean, the entire thing could have easily been B movie material    but the script, the directing, the acting, and the execution elevate it way above a B movie.There is a lot of female nudity, but I did not find it gratuitous (there's also a good amount of corresponding male nudity, under different circumstances). It's typically British matter of fact nudity. The female nudity serves the plot and heightens the vulnerability of the victim, but, as a woman, I found it to be as tastefully done as possible under the circumstances. If this had been made in Hollywood, the nudity would have been far greater, far more gratuitous, and much more like B movie torture porn. Fortunately, it wasn't made in Hollywood    one of the reasons why it's so good.In a completely unintentional way I'm sure, I almost find The Disappearance of Alice Creed to thumb its nose at your average Hollywood thriller. It shows how good a movie can be when you focus on script, plot, acting, and direction    to the exclusion of focusing on butts in seats and opening weekends, or trying to tweak those with focus groups and test screenings.The DVD extras are decent. Haven't listened to the commentaries yet, but the dual screen comparison of the storyboards with the actual film was interesting and shows how well they adhered to the original visual conception. The outtakes are funny moments of the actors forgetting their lines or being unable to get past a fit of giggles (the guys, surprisingly). I watched the outtakes mostly to jazzure myself that nothing really bad happened to any of the actors    that's how authentic and compelling the plot and characters are! I feel silly admitting that, but the first third of the movie is rather knuckle whitening to sit through, especially as a woman    you really fear the worst for Alice.Also: as with many British films, I had to watch it the first time with the subtitles on, or I wouldn't have understand some of the dialogue. I recommend this to non British viewers unfamiliar with the accents of various parts of the UK. My second and third viewings, I didn't need the subtitles. (You won't get many subtitles for the first ten minutes, because there is no dialogue.)","fiendishly suspenseful, with truly unexpected plot twists; NOT an action/gangster film, but a psychological thriller",1373760000,"07 14, 2013",5,1
"Arrow symbolizes what we all want in our heros, not some politically correct 2 dimensional character but a person with depth who gets mad and sometimes gives the bad guy the ultimate justice.  I am not a fan of ultra violent television but there needs to be a line of reality in shows like this and this one seems to walk that line better than any i have seen in recent years.the cast just seems to flow together (although the son becoming the enemy plotline    shades of Spider Man is lame).  The enemies not only on the streets but in the boardroom will add a huge amount of depth and entertainment to this show this season.I am getting a bad feeling that they are going to turn this into one of those shows where he never kills anyone because he is so non violent and such.

"This series may be the best series produced on television in years. I love it, and it is well done in every detail. A TV series viewed by streaming beats straight up Hollywood movies every time. I think that they as a genre have the better screen play writers and they are more tightly constructed. I for one am forever binge watching something made devoid of commercials. My favorites are Revenge, The Lying Game, which was truncated in the broadcaster's blunder, and Ringer. I confess I am also enjoying Switched at Birth. As an only child (now 78 and reliving my childhood in my day dreams), I enjoy stories involving brewed up and reconstructed sibling relationship. Wish I had a sibling. Put your shrinks to work on this and it may help you get at the core of why some people of my age like things. Market research, but you can't simply ask. You have to figure it out. Oh, for best actress in these I have to go with Ally Chando and maybe Vanessa Marano.

"When I saw this series twenty years ago, I was very affected by the way the families and royalty of Rome must have lived. It is shocking to see the evil that flourished in the Roman Empire at the time.Rome may have been the Cradle of Civilization, but it was also the cauldron where the seven deadly sins could nurture and grow and repeat generation after generation. Serial killers seem to have abounded there, and if that didn't affect you maybe the lead in the drinking vessels did! (That was not mentioned for obvious reasons). Livia really scared me; Claudius was a real survivor and by the end, I was not surprised of his entire life being one of abuse from others (with a few exceptions that I was glad for). What can I say about Caligula that hasn't already been said? He is so thoroughly evil and misguided and insane.They say this miniseries is the most watched of all time and I can believe it. It is a fascinating study of the darkest parts of humankind. It is very well acted and well written. I can't help but give it 5 stars!

"This is the first show Amazon has made that feels like something that will make people sit up and notice Amazon Originals. Yes, the widestream appeal is limited but it's a quality show, touching on a topic that is still taboo in the 21st century, and it is something that you simply won't find anywhere else right now.For me, this is an absolute no brainer in terms of a pickup for another season. The one issue might be that between this and Mozart in the City, Amazon is getting a little too niche and almost feeling like a bigger budgeted IFC rather than an outlet that can compete with the networks or HBO.

"My bias...Loves: Gangster moviesLikes: Gratuitous violenceDislikes: Long moviesHates: Homemade dentistryI've been looking forward to Beat Takeshi's 'Outrage' for months. I saw the trailer last fall and was instantly excited, and was even more excited this week when I saw that it popped up on Netflix available for streaming. Needless to say, I watched it the first chance I got.The long and short of this flick   Beat plays a guy who runs a crew that takes care of the Yakuza's dirty work. Obviously, there's some things that can go awry with a profession like this and things get hairy. What evolves is a double crossing, lying, cheating, murderous tale that involves too many players to keep track of. Fingers get lopped off, bullets fly, and blood spills.You'll have to pay attention to get the most out of this movie, but stick with it. It's a brisk movie, at 109 minutes   just to my tastes   but there's a lot going on.

Just void of anything spiritual with scenarios that seriously needed some faith.  But, I sure did watch each episode and was sad more were not yet available yet.

"I enjoy Alton Brown's GOOD EATS on so many levels. First, the obvious   the food. He shows you many ways in which to cook a particular food, or within a certain category of food. Second, AB comes from the school of Harold McGee's &#34;On Food and Cooking&#34; where the science of food becomes applicable in understanding why foods react the way they do. How certain foods react with different metals and why some foods get along and others do not (depending on what you do to them). So Alton extends this information in a fun, visual way. AB's humor, to me, really makes this show a fun way to learn about cooking. He has silly characters throughout, running gags from show to show, and has a geeky mannerism that makes his character charming. His style of directing is very well controlled and organized. His panning shots along a counter top, with ingredients lined up, makes for easy &#34;digestion&#34; of the recipe. He includes little bits of history throughout the show about food or some interesting incident concerning the food. All in all, AB packs a high amount of information through both visual and his hyper verbal manner of spewing information. If you enjoy cooking or are thinking about it   look no more! This is your source. I also recommend the three books which covers every episode in an almost as informative way.",A Cooking Show That Has Continuity,1382918400,"10 28, 2013",5,1

"Season Three of ""Veronica Mars"" is often panned by critics and fans alike.  I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality (creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them) but to let the fans of ""Veronica Mars"" know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about.  This is cljazzic V. Mars.Veronica Mars, a show very centered on the high school setting, easily survives something that has killed countless shows:  The shift to college.  Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series, giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters.  Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters (namely Piz, a true tool) instead of established favorites (Wallace catches it the worst here), the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series.  Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica.  Usually  I know this is true for a lot of people  the most captivating characters are the supporting ones.  However, Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that's saying a lot, as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless.  With characters like Logan, Keith Mars, Dick Casablancas, Wallace, and Weevil, one can't go wrong.Changes were made (due to pressure from the Network), most notably the shift of the usual format of a season long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up.  The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs.  The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus, the next revolving around a cljazzic whodunnit murder mystery, and the final five episodes (the weakest of the series) are essentially standalones.  They function well enough as standalones, but the strength of the series has always been in it's story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews.  We get the never before seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been (which never came to fruition, thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves) and more extras than you will know what to do with.  It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled, as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.9 10",Television of the Highest Quality,1197936000,"12 18, 2007",5,1

"To begin with, I have to say there is nothing I identify with with these people.  They are the definition of trash.  However, I will take trash and violence any day over CSI plasticity and commercials.  Of course, this means I only watch the uncut video.  With Netflix streaming and Amazon Video on Demand, it's the only way to go.  I have watched maybe 3 hours of broadcast since May, and that was all I could take.Now, back to SAMCRO.  If you take the series as vignettes into the worst side of society exaggerated enough to make it interesting, you have this series.  It is well acted and produced and the second year seems to have better continuity than the first.  It will give you all the blood and gratuitous violence you could ask for, but it is not anywhere near the top 20 or 30 of my all time favorites.Breaking Bad and Dexter outcljazz the Sons of Anarchy by far.  The Sopranos had characters who were just as evil and sociopathic, but you still felt some train of civility in the series.  This is about Western humanity at its lowest denomenator.  These are the people no one really wants to be, and they are created to show that through all the crime and violence, they never really get ahead, or find any happiness.  You learn why civilized society, with all its flaws, is still a far better alternative to the amoral, dysfunctionally immature lives these people lead.I'm sure there are real life people who are very close to these gangsters, and it is sad that any baby brought into this world could end up becoming anything resembling these creatures.  They create their own prisons, the very opposite of what they think they are fighting for, in their own lives by their own choices.  They have no freedom.  They are characatures of an ideal that can only be achieved by living your life in a completely opposite direction.As a press photographer, I saw a lot of this carnage and insanity, and the question I always had was why these people couldn't make the simplest positive decision in their lives.  They end up being the ultimate victims of totalitarian control.  They are trite, worthless to society, and the best argument next to fundamentalists at the opposite end of the spectrum for rounding up the polar ends of our society, sticking the bikers and gangsters in Kansas and the fundamentalists in Alabama and just building fences around them, so they can do their thing, no matter how unproductive and bizarre.Slight spoiler:  At the end of one episode, the central character and his mother, who had been gang raped and beaten by thugs from organized crime, climb on top of the ""clubhouse"" roof to watch the sunset and share a cigarette in a totally repulsive, squalor laden industrial area.  Just the American Dream I want for my children...NOT!  Actually, the grossest part for me was the cigarette sharing...single wide, there you are!We are attracted to that which repulses us for some reason, and Sons of Anarchy is as repulsive as Palin's Alaska or Some ""Octomom Christmas"" special, although not as bad as a series based on a merry band of pedophiles.It is a sad commentary on a degenerate minority, but if the alternative is Two and a Half Men, I'll take SAMCRO every time.  It is well done and gives food for thought and imagination.

"This was a great idea for a series, or a movie. I think people were turned off by the constant time sequencing in the first few episodes, I almost stopped watching because of it.But it turned out to be a surprisingly interesting story.I never thought that Sophia would turn out to be a manipulating homicidal maniac, but towards the end of the series it became clear that she never had any intention of living in peace with the human population. It seems she was just stalling while the plans to invade Earth were being worked out.I liked the suggestion that ancient drawings in Europe weredepictions of the Guardians that are here to protect us from the invaders.This could have been a great long running series if the writers had spent more time on it, and the producers were serious about making the story, not just trying something out.",This was a good idea,1358208000,"01 15, 2013",5,1

"As I said in a previous review of this series, Major Crimes has the potential to be very good but it hadn't quite reached the right balance of storyline and character interaction.  However, I have to say that this episode, Medical Causes (#3) was finally there!  It stopped dwelling on the 'process' of deal making and concentrated not only on a fun main storyline but the balance between Provinza, Rayder, Flynn and Rusty was perfectly in sync!  So if you thought that the first two episodes were just a little subpar, you will be happy with this episode because they've pushed it up closer to the level we saw in The Closer.  And even the new female detective is starting to find her place in the unit and is growing on me in the same way the misadventures of Flynn and Provenza eventually did in The Closer.",Finally up to speed with great chemistry,1346457600,"09 1, 2012",5,1

"Like Orange is the New Black, this series both fascinates and depresses me deeply.  The stark reality of The Killing sucks you in and slowly holds you until it becomes a bear trap.  Each character becomes a real person and as you understand them, with all their flaws, the more you understand why they are who they are.This is not a masterpiece like Breaking Bad or even Dexter, but it makes you think.  It's other comparable series are Justified and The Walking Dead, although Walking Dead is pure fantasy with lifelike character development.What is starting to annoy me a bit is that it seems to concentrate more and more on pedophilic killings than I would care to see.  If there is a fourth season, I hope it moves to another area.My one huge complaint is the gratuitous and unnecessary use of tobacco.  I feel like I'm coming down with COPD, emphysema and lung cancer right after an episode.  Only 17% of adults and 19 23% of teens smoke anymore, depending on area and education.  While almost everyone in this series is so totally neurotic that it's not surprising they'd be weak enough to be addicted to tobacco, it's still unnecessary and uncalled for.  Watching the two leads act as if they're healthy, Sarah running and Holder kicking derriere, I still expect them to stroke out during any given scene.It's not presented as ""healthy"" but it is presented as ""acceptable.""  To me, it interferes with the story and makes me hate every character that sucks on the most deadly addictive drug in existence.  If it's not there, you don't miss it.  Why have it to begin with?The almost constant rain and dismal settings do everything we need to see the depressing nature of The Killing.",Gritty intensity.

"Have you ever read Poe's tale of intrigue and suspense called The Black Cat?  About a murderer who walls up his dead wife and the cat gets in there somehow with suspenseful results?The Masters of Horror Showtime series had Jeffrey Combs as Edgar Allen Poe in their second season, episode 24 of their anthology series.  Poe is a drunk and is suffering writer's block in his home in 1841 Pennsylvania.  We see him unable to pay his bar bill, gets thrown out on his rear several times and has some interesting delusions caused by alcohol.He has two worries: money and his wife suffering from ""the consumption"" where she coughs blood (quite realistic).  Poe goes nuts at one point and smashes the piano they were going to sell.  Suddenly the piano is fine.  Alcoholic delusion?The viewer is kept guessing throughout the hour episode as to what is delusion and what is real.  When Poe crushed a half dead bird, his goldfish disappears and when he pops out the cat Pluto's eye (ewwwwhh!!) darn that's hard!  Just hard!As I'm watching this I know that his wife died some years later from consumption (TB) and not an axe between the eyes (another sight you want to wait to see well after dinner) and so the story intrigued me and yet was fairly familiar with Poe's tale.Was the Black Cat autobiographical, a real thing, or an alcoholic delusion?Combs comes off of his film Re Animator and again plays a slightly crazed yet not as eccentric part as Poe    he even looks like the famous horror writer!Drinking gallons of whiskey may not break your writer's block but this horror story may.

"[Rec] 3: Genesis is a refreshing entry in the [Rec] series. The events in Genesis occur at the same time as the events in the the first two films  you can even see news coverage of the original film in one of the scenes. During Koldo and Clara's wedding festivities, a relative that was bitten by a dog before arriving (the dog from the original) gets sick and falls over a balcony. He bites his wife, and chaos erupts.As I previously stated, Genesis is a refreshing entry; at around the 20 mark, you'll see a title screen and be introduced to a traditional style of filming as it ditches the found footage style. As a fan of [Rec], I was originally a little disappointed. But, there have been so many found footage horror films since 2007 (many of them being very bad) that it was refreshing to see a great, traditional horror film. The violence in this film is taken to the next level. The first film was running and hiding, the second film had more shooting, and this film focuses more on melee combat (think: Dead Rising). This violence includes a chainsaw cutting someone vertically and heads being chopped off; it was a bit cheesy at times, but it didn't bother me too much. I did like the dark humor this film had, though. I smiled and laughed a couple of times, and with bizarre characters like SpongeJohn, it was hard not to. But it's not a complete comedy, the movie has some very serious and even sad scenes. *Very minor spoiler* There is a scene where a bunch of survivors (mostly kids, I believe) are loaded onto a bus only to be mjazzacred and Koldo can only helplessly watch from a security monitor (remember, these are his relatives). The ending was also great, my favorite ending of the series. Overall, the acting was fantastic, especially Koldo and Clara (although she's on the cover, she wasn't used enough), the music was great and it had some beautiful shots of the ""zombie"" chaos.I highly recommend [Rec] 3: Genesis. I'm not saying to lower your expectations, but considering this film moves in a different direction, I recommend expecting something a bit different. I've got a feeling that this will be a hate it or love it film, and at $9.99, I recommend you rent with caution. Although it may not be as scary as the original, it still packs in some scares and plenty of thrills. As a fan of the series, I was completely satisfied by this entry.

"Of all the movies that I have viewed this year, this one has to be up there with the best. The amazing direction of David Mackenzie, the lulling and mournful soundtrack by Max Richter and the photography by Giles Nuttgens (both beautiful and distressing combined) pull a metaphorical statement from beginning to end.Michael (Ewan McGregor) is an executive chef who meets Susan (Eva Green), a saddened epidemiologist, after she returns home from examining a patient with a very disturbing affliction.  Inexplicable, as he suddenly lost his sense of smell for no apparent reason.  This continues on to several other people at first then runs amok.These two begin an intimate relationship quite rapidly, as everything in this movie happens quickly and without warning with one exception: each person will fall into a severe emotional occurrence previous to losing their ability to smell.Susan and her team give it the name 'Severe Olfactory Syndrome' (SOS) as it reaches epidemic proportions and spreads world wide.  There are no explanations given as there is no time, therefore one must think on their own of how, why or what is happening.  The movie heavily affects your time in reacting.  It causes suspenseful anxiety to build readily and rapidly as you are left questioning the reasons why.The erotic relationship between Michael and Susan hardly gets a chance to develop, as the rapid fire affliction follows into another sense (taste) and similarly eradicates it.  Michael is 'affected' and this is devastating to his career as is Susan affected also.  The couple is growing more and more dependent on each other as the happenings around them are mercurial and deconstructing.The symptoms preceding the loss of the senses are bewildering, wonder struck and deeply disturbing.  People are losing control, panicking  and literally start unstoppable eating of anything and everything (from lipstick to things you have got to see for yourself).  The photography and camera angles get increasingly confusing while bringing this chaos to life; it is all out catastrophic.People are running wild, rioting in the streets as everything is unsafe and sickness is omnipresent.  There is so much to this movie that I wouldn't want to go on with the plot any longer as I would hate to ruin anyone's response to this movie...and your response itself is everything.Running amid the course of the film are short plugged in narratives that work well.  They serve to make you think, as this is a frightening portrait of annihilation in a very different form.When someone loses one of their senses, it is usually just that one and devastating enough alone.  The ending of this movie presents a whole alternative view to this, as tomorrow is no guarantee and ""gather ye rosebuds while ye may"".",This Will Give You A Profound Appreciation For What It Means To Be Alive,1337731200,"05 23, 2012",5,1

"I Just started watching this series and I am up to episode 12.  I love the cast, particularly Gary S.  and since I live in NY I am veryfamiliar with the settings and feel at home watching this.  It took some getting use to because though I am a big CASTLE fan andthat is set in NY too, this show seems to be darker and much less humorless.  I hope as the show goes on that I will find a bit morehuman feelings between the  characters develop.  Still, I find it good enough to order the first 7 seasons on DVDs; goes along wellwith my BONES, CASTLE and MENTALIST sets.  Now I am watching season one on my Video Library.  I do recommend this tomy fellow telly watching crime fighter viewers.Since I wrote the above review I have finished season 1 of CSI NY.  I think it was splendid; in some ways it reminds me of CASTLE, beingset in Manhattan and visualizing the landscape with very similar photography.  But it is more gritty, like CHICAGO PD, than Castle withoutmuch of the humor, though the last few episodes seem to humanize the cast better.  I happen to think that Gary Sinese is splendid in the chiefrole of boss and the other cast members do well also.  I have ordered the entire 9 season DVD sets from Amazon and trying to be patient waitingfor them.  I think it takes some getting use to the darker stories in the programs if you are used to Bones or Castle, but watch it: it willgrow on you.  Though I live in NY and love the city, I don't really like Manhattan though this show makes me almost like it.

This has a reasonably interesting story arc that links a series of studies about people locked in a closed environment together. There are all the personality types here and they are being played out as expected. What is generally missing is that the reason for the dome seems to bother no one in particular and they focus on their own local petty squabbles etc.The photography is superb and the acting is well done with reasonable characters. It will not satisfy the real scifi buffs as the dome is not explored very much up to this point.

"From a review I wrote for Bleeding Cool:One of my favourite Science Fiction movies of the year, the adaptation of Philip K. Dick&#8217;s Radio Free Albemuth opens theatrically in ten US cities this week after a successful Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for distribution. Everyone should see it.Shot on an indie budget, the story takes place in an alternate 1984 where a Nixon esque right wing president has imposed martial law in America and a music executive finds himself receiving mystical transmissions from an alien intelligence that changes his life and encourages him to seek out the Resistance and help them overthrow the government.The original novel was published in 1985, three years after Dick&#8217;s death. It was one of his most personal books because he was fictionalising the mystical experiences in real life that his hero had, and wrote himself as a character in the book as the hero&#8217;s best friend to question what had happened to him. It started him on the path of exploring his Gnosticism and mystical enquiries that fuelled his writing for the rest of his life. He had originally written the novel in 1976 under the title &#8220;Valis system A&#8221; and submitted it for publication but his editors at the time asked for too many changes than he was willing to make.  He went on to write Valis, The Divine Invasion and The Transmigration of Timothy Archer, which weren&#8217;t really Science Fiction novels. Radio Free Albemuth was, in effect, the last Science Fiction novel Dick wrote, and if Tim Powers hadn&#8217;t held onto the manuscript and brought to publishers&#8217; attention after Dick&#8217;s death, we might never have known about it.John Alan Simon&#8217;s movie adaptation is a true labour of love, a small movie with big ideas that faithfully fallows the novel and its preoccupations with mysticism and fighting totalitarianism. Alongside Richard Linklater&#8217;s A Scanner Darkly, it&#8217;s the only movie that faithful adapts a Philip K. Dick novel. It also feel like the novel in its evocation of 1985 and its dystopian atmosphere. It does have minor alterations: the main characters in the movie are still in their vibrant 30s instead the most tired middle age of the novel, and Simon relocates the story from Orange County to Los Angeles because that&#8217;s where the music industry is based, and it makes more sense to have the main character move there when he starts working as a music executive.There&#8217;s an elegiac feel to the movie, not only because it&#8217;s a story about the friendship between a man changed by a mystical, extraterrestrial experience and his sceptical best friend, but also that it&#8217;s the kind of independent film that&#8217;s in danger of dying out in light of studios only producing blockbusters and the internet chipping away at traditional ways of watching movies. It&#8217;s also more overtly political in its commentary on surveillance, the loss of civil rights and the need to resist. When I first saw the movie at a special screening last year, Edward Snowden hadn&#8217;t happened yet, and what a difference a year makes in the way that places this movie square in the center of the zeitgeist, becoming even more timely now than when I first saw it. It&#8217;s also a movie that evokes Los Angeles as a state of mind, one of my continuing obsessions.This is Science Fiction without the need for hundred million dollar budgets, explosions, shootouts or major special effects. It&#8217;s all about ideas and how they can create a whole different world and state of mind just by context. It&#8217;s one of the essential movies of the year, and to see it in a theatre if you can is a show of support for not only this type of independent movie, but for the theatrical experience. Simon has accomplished the challenging task of bringing Philip K. Dick&#8217;s provocative and chilling vision and sensibility to the screen with terrific performances, especially Shea Whigham from Boardwalk Empire as Philip K. Dick and Alanis Morissette as a kind of slacker Joan of Arc co conspirator.  If it&#8217;s not at a cinema in your town, you can catch it On Demand.

"The whole season led to this, a nightmarish finish that finds Revolutionary War secret agent Ichabod Crane and modern day police LT Abbie Mills searching for a hidden map that will lead them to Purgatory,there to rescue Ichabod's wife, the witch Katrina.  What they find instead is a chilling betrayal by an unsuspected enemy.  Ichabod and Abbie will be trapped in different worlds, with their friends in equally dire straits, and their ancient and evil enemy Moloch seeming triumphant.  An eager and frightened audience can hardly wait for Season Two...This whole series was a clever remake of the Washington Irving tale, part science fiction and part ghost story, and all entertainment.  Ichabod Crane wakens from a two hundred year sleep beneath Sleepy Hallow to find the world changed but his ancient nemesis the Headless Horseman on the loose.  His alliance with young police lieutenant Abbie Mills leads to an entertaining mixture of old clues and a new conspiracy in the midst of Sleepy Hallow.  They are jazzisted by Abbie's sister Jenny, herself full of surprises, and by acting police chief Captain Irving, who can't quite believe what horrors keep turning up.

"The basic formula for Continuum in the first two seasons has been reasonably consistent   a technology suited cop from the future is out to prevent a terrorist group while trying to get back to her family. Each week promises a little romantic subtext with her cop buddy, some new gadgets on the robo suit, a couple of action sequences and all in all it's a good serialized sci fi drama.Reading between the lines, series 3 apparently wasn't supposed to happen but SyFy made a push for more episodes, leaving the writers looking for a new direction to expand into over several seasons if necessary. The new opening sequence is a prelude to a totally new approach to the story which reduces the significance of the Liber8 terrorist group, completely drops the hero's desire to get home to the future and minimizes the character interplay with her cop partner. It brings in many new characters and moves to blur the lines completely on their motivations.Most importantly, this season introduces time travel in a major way which has given the writers the ability to work with multiple time lines, add duplicates of characters that are good and bad, and bring back those previously written out. Where it's less successful is that some of the episodes are extremely weak in dialog, action and general coherence in keeping the audience on track of where it's going (check the ratings to see viewers falling away every week). This is especially true of the early parts of the season that are at times directionless and confusing.On the plus side, if you're willing to sit through the transition, there's a payoff that hints at a much richer version of the concepts emerging. Continuum has always showed the antagonist and protagonist point of view without taking sides so season 3 now allows the lead character to start switching sides and struggle with multiple future possibilities where the villains aren't so obvious and alliances change accordingly. There are 2 or 3 genuinely &#34;wow&#34; moments that make you realize the seeming randomness of the earlier episodes was building to something and with the new story arcs set up promises a gripping season 4.Therein lies the rub of course since there may not be any viewers left to watch the next season and the ratings seem to indicate it might be axed. In the early part of this year's offering, I wondered if I was watching another totally TV derailment like when Heroes and Lost imploded, but actually if you can persist, Continuum is one of the most interesting and daring sci fi offerings currently on TV.",Hang in there - the show is changing direction.

"REC1   A news reporter and some firemen are quarantined inside of an apartment building where the tenants are starting to succumb to a very zombie like infection. A horror film that was clever without drawing too much attention to its found footage gimmick, which it used more effectively than most others.REC2   Taking place immediately after the previous film, this movie follows a SWAT team and three teenagers (plus a few others) as they enter the apartment building to figure out what's going on. Annoying characters and inconsistencies ruined what was actually an intelligent addition to the overall storyline. Or, if not intelligent, then at least not just par for the course. These aren't strictly zombies, in other words. There's something larger at work.REC3   Taking place at the same time as the first two movies (as evidenced by glimpses of TV news reports that occasionally flash by in the background), this film follows the strange infection as it makes its way to a wedding and its cljazzy reception. If you've watched both of the previous films, you can probably guess the overall tenor of the film    it doesn't pull many punches, in other words    but it is notable for at least taking the franchise (?) in a more interesting direction.I was worried, fifteen minutes in, that I was going to hate this film more than any of the others. The found footage thing was in full swing, most of it relying on the wedding video type stuff that seems to write itself    pervy, loud mouthed uncle; reticent but glowing bride; nervous and dorkily handsome groom; grampa with a crappy hearing aid, etc. This wasn't done poorly, but also not uniquely.With the longest first act I've seen in a zombie film (we see a title card around twenty minutes in), this movie's found footage gimmick grew more and more annoying, relying on so many shaky, out of focus, ""realistic"" shots that it was aggravating. This gets even more pronounced when things at the party really start to get out of hand. Yes, chaotic, blurry and uncertain shots are a more authentic take on the found footage theme, but they are also a reminder of some of that theme's worst drawbacks.Then, when it's at its worst, the movie seems to pop, like a bubble, into a traditional zombie movie. No more found footage: inexplicably. The change isn't just aesthetic, either. When it reverts to normal filming, it also reverts to a grim cartoon of itself. Like a typical Hollywood version of what felt both realer and more difficult to watch when it was through the lens of found footage. There's an ironic soundtrack, love so powerful that it transcends space, and a general music video sense of badjazzery. It seems like it wants to be funny, but earnestly so. Some of the tweaks work and some of them don't (most especially, for me, the ending, which combined the maudlin with the morbid in a way that made it seem confused). When it isn't leaning hard on the romance, it's a watchable satire of the genre, with enough gore and tension to keep from being a complete joke.There are bound to be fans who will not like the shift in style or tone, and seeing as how it doesn't fully work, there is certainly room for complaint. However, I enjoyed it much more than the last film. The parts that work are a nice change of pace from the jittery, hand held corner these films had painted themselves into, and they are also a clever commentary on the difference between second person, behind the lens films and the slightly removed, slight of hand of traditional cinema.",RECovering From The Found-Footage Habit,1345334400,"08 19, 2012",4,1

"I have to admit that I stand corrected. After Michael and Pam left Dunder Mifflin last week, I was seriously concerned for the future of the show. I just couldn't see a world where Michael wasn't doing some kind of crazy, unproductive thing around the office while Pam and Jim play pranks on Dwight. However, in ""Dream Team,"" we were treated to something surprisingly entertaining and funny.The Michael Scott Paper company officially begins in Michael's condo. Michael puts together a ""dream team"" of people to kick things off. We finally get to see what happened to Ryan after he got out of prison for fraud and, it seems, returns to the cast for good. Michael and his team set out to find investors for their fledgling company, but run into trouble when it becomes clear that Michael has no clear idea what his company is or where its going. One of the dream team members jumps ship while Pam convinces Michael to continue with the company. Together, Michael, Pam and Ryan move into open office space in the same building as Dunder Mifflin.Meanwhile, Jim makes a bad impression on his new boss, Charles, while Andy continues his usual brown nosing antics. In order to change the Charles's view of him, Jim lies about his soccer playing abilities. This leads to an office wide soccer game where Dwight spends the entire time trying to expose Jim's lie.While there isn't too much screen time back at good old D M, Michael and co. get much needed time to play off one another. The ending does get a little serious, even for The Office, but the rest of the episode is so funny that it works. I found myself laughing out loud several times  in fact, more often than I have in recent Office episodes.","Michael's ""Dream Team""",1239321600,"04 10, 2009",5,1

"There are some things to like in this show and some things to definitely dislike. But first off this is a tale set shortly after the American Civil War, focusing on a Confederate veteran who is seeking several men who did his deceased wife wrong. Turns out these people have gone west to work for the railroad company looking to reach the Pacific Ocean by a certain point. Of course, the tale branches off into several subplots and layered relationships. Colm Meaney, who some might remember from STAR TREK, is best known to me and plays an investor with a stake in this venture as it will hopefully make him his fortune. The outfits and looks of things feel right though the dialogue at times feels a bit too modern. It's slow in the beginning but that's because they're developing several subplots which will eventually overlap. There's some good coverage of relations between Irish and former slaves which is well done and has a great deal of truth to it for the era (both sides were competing for similar jobs), as well as the effects Manifest Destiny had upon the American Indians in the way (anybody else recognize a certain actor from LAST OF THE MOHICANS?) of progress. There are also some nice contradictions in the series, like evangelists preaching alongside hookers at work and talk of fair wages amidst rampant racism. For Deadwood fans I'd say this is better than the third season but certainly not the first and arguably a notch down from the second season. Budgetary concerns kept out Chinese Americans which got criticisms. The show is hoping to rectify this in the second season but it all depends on finances. On that note this premiere was the second most popular of AMC shows to date bringing in 4.4 million viewers.

"This is a interesting take on werewolves , the type that are actually wolves after changing. And not some kind of huge monster. The world of this Canadian show so far only features the werewolves , but in such a world many types of things will exist. Similar to being human,  only these werewolves remember each turn and  enjoy it.  The main story is about the pack being attacked by 'mutts'  , or non pack werewolves. As the series goes on we learn more about the whole structure of the werewolf  scene as well. Why the mutts don't form their own packs is not explained.  But Of course many people will watch this do to it's attractive cast. But they manage to do a good job here.  This is more a show for older teens and adults than kids though.  However it's a great thing to have a good horror series on tv. Netflix had a one series 'werewolf show as well.  But this will be around for a second season, unlike the doomed ' primeval new world, and Sinbad. both of whom were imported like this show from other countries. The Canadians are coming up with some great shows though.  'lost girl' , 'contimuum' and others. that are very good indeed.

"The premise is clever  based on a real congressional house sharing arrangement  but the humor could be missed by half the potential audience. Creator Gary Trudeau protests that this is not about ideology  I'm no Aaron Sorkin"" he says. But if it only tweaks conservative Republicans  an easy target (e.g., awards from ""The Council for Normal Marriage"")it seems less funny and more editorializing. If the plots skirt around just jabbing at the Tea Party mentality and rather seeks the absurd humor in the many foibles of politicians in general (the bit about the trip to Afghanistan heads in the right direction; see also HBO's VEEP) I could see a brighter future for John Goodman and company.","Where ""Newsroom"" hits high, ""Alpha House"" hit low",1367712000,"05 5, 2013",4,1

"Deb Jane is doing her thing again this season. Season 3 ended with Stacy telling Grayson that Jane was really Deb. I've been watching the free episodes, but when Stacy dropped that bombshell, I had to buy season 4.This season had its usual share of Ally McBealish cases. I like the weird verdicts and all of the singing   what can I say? I'm a sucker for musicals. What isn't so easy for me to digest is Brandi's role as Parker's baby mama.  Brandi will always be Brandi to me. I can't imagine her in an acting role.  Also I don't get how easy it is for Jane and Grayson to sleep around with other people when they know they really want each other. It's like two dogs in heat circling around each other.Well, finally on the very last episode of season 4, Jane is about to marry Owen (who by the way, I don't think is a good match for her), when Grayson tells her he's in love with her! They kiss, and then at that exact moment, Owen walks in, see them, clutches his heart, and....wait! I can't tell you what happened. You gotta watch it for yourself!And let's hope that there is a season 5. As of this moment, Lifetime has not decided to pick the show up for a 5th season.

"I've finished watching all four seasons and have tried to figure out what made this series so watchable. I couldn't get enough. The overall plot was basically incomprehensible, there were so many holes and so much illogic that it should have been awful  but it wasn't. I've watched other popular sci fi shows, and found them blah after a few episodes, the characters one dimensional, the story arc predicatble. I was watching a discussion of the BSG show with Ron Moore, and something he said finally clicked: we learn more from our heroes by their flaws than their virtues. The characters on BSG are VERY flawed  they're just plain wrong a lot, they use their positions for personal purposes, they can't figure out who they really love, they shift allegiances according to what serves the moment  and that makes them immensely intriguing. Is Baltar a saint or a devil? How about Roslin  does the end justify the means? Is Adama a hypocrit? What the frakk is wrong with Starbuck? And how can you not forgive Lee for being such a goody two shoes when he had come through the battle of the bulge? The scene with Apollo and Starbuck in the ring in priceless  what better way to prove how much you love someone than by knocking their teeth out. Not that anybody's teeth every get knocked out, fortunately. It's one of those seemingly illogical things, that after as many blows to the jaw as they all take, any of them have any front teeth at all. And what's with the way the sixes dress? I mean, really, put some clothes on. The heat can't be all that good in those big drafty ships. So, in sum, all the plot holes and illogical points are so overpowered by the amazing acting and perfect casting and great character development and endless surpises and REALLY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE that you HAVE to keep watching. When Baltar says things like, ""I never really belonged to you, you appropriated me"" or ""You're right. I wouldn't trust me either"" you want to cheer the writers. The subtlety of that is something few shows can achieve. And then, of course, there's the HUGE pay off at the end. Not many series can boast that. Most dribble away into some underwhelming resolution that seems to be there just because the show has to end somehow. I REALLY want more  not a prequel. I want to know what happens next  how come only one dna line makes the cut? And really? People as social (or anti social) as Adama and Chief would choose human isolation? You can't even be anti social if you don't have something to be anti TO. So please, I wanna know how it all works out for the next 150,000 years...or at least the next 148,000 of them.More, please.",Amazing series,1364083200,"03 24, 2013",5,1

"Annie Barlow (Caity Lotz) comes back to her childhood home to attend her estranged mother's funeral only to discover that her sister Nicole (Agnes Bruckner) has been missing, leaving her young daughter alone. Annie then experiences some weird events while sleeping in the house, when another person also disappears mysteriously.One interesting aspect of ""The Pact"" is that the house the sisters lived in looks like any other ordinary house on the street. It is not a Gothic manor house, or a cottage surrounded by woods. Of course, this is no ordinary house, as it turns out, and as we follow the process of her uncovering secrets, we learn what was really going on in the film's opening sequence.This is a well crafted supernatural thriller, where things eventually make sense (sort of) within the context of the story. There are a few genuinely scary moments, but what makes ""The Pact"" special is the unique approach to the oft covered subject matter, fine performances from the capable cast including Casper Van Dien and scene stealing Haley Hudson as a young psychic, and clever storytelling by writer director Nicholas McCarthy (his feature debut) with his smart and confident direction.",Effective and Smart Horror,1355961600,"12 20, 2012",4,1

"Warning! The following contains spoilers. If you haven't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free, do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet. Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed. What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy, demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals (disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated)? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having ""us"" attack ""them"" by the death of another semi recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right, as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was, despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France, became increasingly blatant. To his credit Moore, a member of the left but a self admitted Rush Limbaugh listener, has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show's run, but in the season's first several episodes that balance fell away. And in the most controversial episode of the season (debated on Internet boards more pjazzionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified, pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand, Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes. All of these were of the ""stand alone"" variety. All of the ""mythology"" episodes (to use the X FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses) were outstanding. In posts on boards, podcasts, and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network. The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers. But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point. This is the beauty of DVDs. Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs, borrowing them from a friend, downloading them from iTunes, or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store. Bizarrely the networks don't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica. Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there, in particular Tigh and Kara. Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica, especially between Kara and Lee, take much of the season resolve, and the whole New Caprica experience doesn't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale. In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs, I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1. The Adama Maneuver: During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet. Since Galactica cannot fly in an atmosphere, they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface, jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth. It is   and I say this with little fear of contradiction   the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV. No one who has seen it has been able to forget it. It is inconceivable that the show won't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects (but then, it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year) and when it does, this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2. Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple. As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks. She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck, kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly. She returns to the dining table, takes a bite, then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin, oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3. The death of Jammer: In ""Collaborators"" several characters we've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica. We've known Jammer since Season One when he, Cally, and Socino tried to make a still. But that doesn't prevent him from being shot out an airlock. Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4. Five great Sharon moments. This is a total cheat, but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five. 1) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon. She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica. Our first shot of her in Season Three, her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture: a desk with books, an end table and coffee table, wall hangings and curtains, a comfy chair, and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch. Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone, except for her. Clearly in the previous year, somehow Sharon had become just about Adama's closest friend. 2) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon, she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet. Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others   whether human or Cylon   that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it. Though some doubt her, Adama's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season. 3) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica. She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers, who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive. Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna's knees. She walks away, saying ""Adama wouldn't lie to me"" (and it turns out he didn't, since he didn't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death). 4) Sharon and Boomer come face to face. One of the season highlights had to be the show's two major Number Eight's meeting. The irony is intense, since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet, unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent. Now, however, Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she doesn't belong with the humans. Her reply is to the point: ""I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie."" 5) Boomer does, however, tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar. After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer's story is true, Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship. Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica. The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon. Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them, ""And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon. All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her, Captain. And you as well, Admiral."" What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt. But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera. Oh, and Sharon is given her own handle: Athena, a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama's daughter. And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5. ""Exodus, Pt. 2"": I said I wouldn't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here. But this episode, which contained ""The Adama Maneuver"" I mentioned above, is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG. At the end of 2006 the well known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year. With total justification they named ""Exodus, Pt. 2"" the number one episode of 2006, not just of BSG but of all television shows combined. It was that good. Four beats made it stand out. First, Saul Tigh's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons, second the Adam Maneuver, third, the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction, and fourth, Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6. The fight between Kara and Lee in ""Unfinished Business."" In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another. In this episode we get that back story. Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another. We see Lee and Kara's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring, learning of the night of pjazzion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another, and of Kara's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning. As Kara and Lee (who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting) collapse into each other's arms, their faces bloody messes, she tells him, ""I missed you."" His mouth filled with blood, he is barely able to say, ""I missed you too."" Her face buried in his shoulder, you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends. One of the best episodes in the show's run.7. In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar, D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal. As he tells Six ""I love you"" D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved. It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8. Adama and Laura's intimacy. Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer, as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic. They still have conflicts. When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her. And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar's trial. But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level. That they have an intimacy that can't be affected by mere disagreement. The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars. It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace 9. Lee Adama's moment on the stand. During Baltar's trial Romo Lampkin (magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co counsel. Jamie Bamber's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10. The last ten minutes of the season: In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five: Tigh, Tyrol, Samuel T. Anders, and Tory (the four T's  giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara ""Starbuck"" Thrace is the fifth member) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads, which turns out, almost impossibly, to be Bob Dylan's ""All Along the Watchtower"" (leading some to refer to them as the Dylons). Then the Cylons attack. The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three: ""The ship is under attack, we do our jobs. . . . My name is Saul Tigh. I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet. Whatever else I am, whatever else it means, that's the man I want to be. And if I die today, that's the man I'll be. But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season, as Lee pursues ""a bogie at my ten"" in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace, who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier. She looks at Lee, jazzures him that it really is her (a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore, who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons), and tells him, ""It's gonna be okay. I've been to Earth. I know where it is. And I'm gonna take us there."" The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet, through the pursing Cylons, back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way, and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system, focusing on earth as the season ends. It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television. If you care for great television, this is the kind of stuff you have to care about. The tragedy is that while every major television critics has pjazzionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV, it has struggled to find viewers. The irony is that many Sci fi fans don't watch it because it doesn't resort to the clich&eacute;s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans don't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci fi fans.

"Who says the sitcom is dead?  Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you don't know what to expect next.  It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, originally premiering on the FX network in 2005, revolves around four friends: Charlie (Charlie Day), Mac (Rob McElhenney), Dennis (Glenn Howerton), and his sister Dee (Kaitlin Olson); all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia.  They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement, ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer.  Yes, there's nothing really wholly original about the show's premise, but it remains hysterically funny throughout.  The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee's father, who isn't the sanest of the bunch either.

It pokes silly fun at people from Portland, pretentious health concious hipsters, too hip for their own good.Ordering food in a restaurant becomes a five year trip to an organic chicken farm run by a charismatic cult leader who imbues every encounter with God like love.The handsome goofy mayor is all over the place mentally, deciding to get together a baseball team for Portland which ends up with whatever pot luck players want to join, including an old man who is deaf, a very obese African American, etc.The long haired proprietors of a bookstore carrying only books about women's issues are snobby space cadets, unable to make change without closing up shop and going to the bank.The title of the show is a combination of the words Portland and Utopia. In one episode, it is explained that Portland has never left the 1800s. Men have long beards and handlebar mustaches. People make their own beer.

She is way too self deprecating, though, which gets really tiresome; and there is lot of negative humor about older women, so don't watch it with your mom. :( Which is sadzers, because she'd love Mindy, if Mindy had a filter.So....

I haven't even finished watching the first episode and decided to write a quick review  just based on the guy wearing a pajama shirt on camera and describing his old window gljazz as hallucinogenic and the cat view as 'Suess'! I love old stuff and like the fact that many items here would of been trashed by other folks. This show isn't pretentious; they aren't prancing around in fancy clothes like some of those renovation people (eye roll); seems down to earth. Who cares if he might have money? At least he seems like a real person.,Pajama shirt Awesome!,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",5,1
"""South Park"" has been one of the few animated television series that seems to have only gotten better with age. Every season, the show seems to improve a bit more. The animation of the show, despite being glorified versions of their construction paper cut outs from 15 years ago, has evolved drastically over the years and now features the likes of cel shading, computer animation, and even live action segments. The writing of the show only gets more imaginative with each season as the show continues to put a viciously comical spin on current events, celebrities, and movies. It's taken 16 seasons to finally check out the show on Blu ray. Even if you're a mjazzive fan of the show, the mindset is that maybe the show doesn't really require fans to watch the show in high definition. But the show looks and sounds darn good in the format.""The Complete Sixteen Season"" features all 14 episodes from season 16 in a sleek two disc Blu ray package (or three discs for the DVD). While the Dolby True HD: English 5.1 surround sound is incredible, it probably won't be your preferred choice if you don't have an excellent sound system in your home. Viewing the series with this option on an HDTV with its normal speakers, the music and sound effects of the show are mjazzively loud while the dialogue is a bit on the low side. Be sure to use the 2.0 Channel sound option to help resolve this issue.Favorite episodes include ""Butterballs,"" ""Sarcastaball,"" ""A Nightmare on Facetime,"" ""A Scause for Applause,"" and ""Obama Wins."" ""A Nightmare on Facetime"" is the first Halloween themed ""South Park"" episode in six years, ""A Scause for Applause"" adds the ""South Park"" spin on Dr. Seuss and WWJD bracelets, and ""Butterballs"" is an exceptional Butters episode that revolves around bullying, Hollywood, and a certain act in San Diego.""Obama Wins"" may be the season's crown jewel as it seems to cover so much and yet feels so effortless in execution. The endless supply of General Tso jokes helps, but most of the episode is carried by the election, ""Star Wars,"" and Morgan Freeman.Nearly every episode has its strengths or, like other ""South Park"" episodes you may not care for the first time around, become more enjoyable with repeat viewings. ""Reverse Cowgirl"" features one of the best one liners of the season (""Dude, you can't force me to wear a seatbelt while I take a dump!"") while ""Cash For Gold,"" ""Faith Hilling,"" ""Cartman Finds Love,"" ""Raising the Bar,"" and ""Insecurity"" are all solid episodes. The least enjoyable episodes are ""Going Native"" and ""I Should Have Never Gone Ziplining."" The show has dabbled with live action before, but the ""Ziplining"" episode may be the first time the boys have been portrayed as real people. So the episode is at least noteworthy for that reason.In addition to the Mini Commentaries on every episode by ""South Park"" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the only other special feature are a little over four minutes of deleted scenes; the best one being one from ""Reverse Cowgirl"" where Jimmy tries to cheer up Craig with some stand up comedy.",Oh Long Johnson,1379980800,"09 24, 2013",4,1

"UPDATE: Surprise, surprise! This series is getting better. It is not restricted to a single baddie and gets better with each episode. I am starting to enjoy it, so I added one star to the rating.++By that statement, I mean that every couple of minutes you will roll your eyes at how ridiculous this series is. Most of the acting is stilted, and the female lead is unbelievable. She does not speak well nor does she communicate intelligence. I find the idea of her being an FBI candidate more implausible then there actually being a headless horseman! I like the genre so I will revisit this series at some point and see if it picks up.

It's as though each person is daring the other to be as authentic in their performance as they can be.

The Fringe team has been seperated for over two decades frozen in amber and unaware of what is happening in the world. Olivia and Peter's daughter was raised as an orphan in this totalitarian new world where humans are little better than slaves. The overall arc is how to beat the Observers and put the timeline back to its original shape.In this episode, Walter, as usual, has the beginnings of a solution but has hidden it in beta tapes that are scattered around the country, a country where humans are no longer free to travel, but the team sets out anyway and discovers a group of people, who are recording humanity's true history in the face of extinction. Clues are found, sacrifices are made and the season long arc is added to. A solid episode of Fringe and an interesting reinvention for one of television's most surreal sci fi shows. Recommended.

"It was a long wait to get SMASH on dvd but here it is and the wait was well worth it.  I fell in love with this show from the first second of the first episode with Katharine McPhee singing the intro to SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW.  I love the theater and was so excited that a tv show was actually going to honestly display what went into the production and making of a musical.  This show is different than any other on tv.  The cast is amazing.  Debra Messing, Angelica Huston and Jack Davenport are stars known for other tv roles and these roles are like nothing they have ever done.  And we get Megan Hilty and Christian Borle direct from the Broadway and theater world.  All shine.  Borle and Messing in particular have a great chemistry.The plot takes many twists and turns and will keep you totally enthralled.  What holds it all together like glue are the amazing musical numbers.  There are some current songs performed but the best are the songs written for the musical MARILYN that the show is about putting together.  And for me the true star here is Katharine McPhee.  I have always been a fan but the dimensions of her musical talent are astounding.  Her voice is strong, beautiful, powerful and emotive.  When she sings BEAUTIFUL tears will come to your eyes.  But what is most exciting is how well she meets all the demands of music within a Broadway show.  Her singing of the show tunes in combination with her superb dancing is the highlight here for me.  She's definitely got the IT factor.  Each episode has shining moments and the whole cast is exceptional but for me the whole season builds to the superb final episode and in particular the closing song.  What a high note to end the season on.  There are only 15 episodes here but they perfectly build a story of relationships, drama, dreams, fears, trials and tribulations while showing all the steps in the making of a musical.My only disappointment is that the show was only released on dvd.  I was waiting in high anticipation for a blu ray of this.  The show with all its glitz and glam and superb musical numbers definitely merited it and I also think all true die hard fans would have gone with the blu ray.  But I will settle for the dvd.  I've already rewatched the entire 15 episodes twice and I highly recommend getting this show on dvd.  And don't think you have to love the theater to like this show.  As stated the acting is superb, and the music will pull you in.  The rivalry between Hilty and McPhee is a fun factor in the season but just a glimpse into the whole story line there is.  I can't wait for season 2 in February!  Ane more McPhee!",Excellent show shines on dvd !!!,1358467200,"01 18, 2013",5,1

"New original shows like Chuck, Reaper and Pushing Daisies made tv worth watching last season despite the writer's strike. Despite bad movies in 2007 having Chuck in the title ""Good Luck Chuck, Chuck and Larry"", a tv show named Chuck was a success. It's about a normal guy named Chuck (Zachary Levi) who works at a Best Buy type store called Buy More. His life changes when he inadvertently downloads critical government secrets into his brain. Two agents get jazzigned to protect him. One is a sexy woman who he instantly has a big crush on named Sarah (Yvonne Strahovski). As his luck would have it, she also gets jazzigned to pose as his g f. While pretending though, he's not even allowed to date anyone else. She's who he wants anyway but he can't really date her either.While the under rated and always cool tough guy Adam Baldwin plays the other agent jazzigned to protect Chuck. Levi, Strahovski and Baldwin all work well together. It's Joshua Gomez though who sometimes steals the show as Chuck's best friend Morgan and who's also a co worker of his. Chuck has a hard time hiding from his family and friends that he's working with the CIA.The show always has many twists and turns while often being very funny as well. It's probably one of the best comedy spy shows to ever hit television. Probably the only bad thing about this season is that it ended early due to writer's strike and doesn't have a season finale. If you missed it when it was on, I recommend getting the first season.","A Funny, Original and Smart Show",1216080000,"07 15, 2008",4,1

"The actors and their characters are well matched, making this show feel more real and natural.  So far, there are not too many contrived situations; stories flow from the characters, how they interact with each other.  This season, the plots seem to only revolve around little mysterious baby, and a line up of evil opponents trying to take her away from the 3 show runners.  I miss the original actors from season 1 3, but I am surprised at how the new actors and characters fit so well, so quickly.  Very impressive.

"I wanted to catch up on the episodes I had missed before the 2nd season started.  Being able to watch each episode without interruption is such a pleasure. This series just touches a time in history when America paid attention to what its global neighbors were doing.  As children in school we discussed Communism and Russia.  This series is very emotionally tied to that era when America was united in a common cause.  The Russians Phillip and Elizabeth are so real, I find myself being sympathetic to their struggles, yet torn by the fact that they are the enemy.

"i think of this kind of thing as similar to SPINAL TAP, which was a mockumentary of a documentary on rock stars.  This is a mock version of a soap opera like tv miniseries.  If you like this kind of thing, it will be five stars for you.  if you can handle this only a great once and awhile, like i can, then it will be less. I guess more apt would be the mock soap opera from decades ago called SOAP. For the first year or two that satire was out of this world. What mainly sustained me though was the late Robert Mulligan as one of the players. This is also similar to the spoof on SNL about the &#34;Californians&#34; which is also ok every once in awhile.  It is not that I cannot see the talent in this.  I can but I just personally can't make it through all these episodes of a satire of a family saga. this review is written primarily for others like me, who can see the talent in it but it just isn't their kind of entertainment.

Sure, there's always an element of alien terror, but nothing that the Doctor can't handle. There's a lot on what the Ponds have been up to lately, more on Rory's father, the introduction of the daughter of a character from the old series, and a few other surprises. Telling any more would be, well, telling, and if you haven't seen this one I don't want to spoil it for you.

"DEFINED: In economics and finance, arbitrage (  &#712;&#593;rb&#616;tr&#593;&#720;&#658; ) is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets: striking a combination of matching deals that capitalize upon the imbalance, the profit being the difference between the market prices; ALSO, expected profit, though losses may occur, and in practice, there are always risks in arbitrage, some minor (such as fluctuation of prices decreasing profit margins), some major (such as devaluation of a currency or derivative).Richard Gere plays Robert Miller, one of the key financial movers and shakers with his own company.  However, he made one wrong move with a copper mine and now he has to sell his company so he will not end up broke and in prison (he misappropriated millions in order to cover the loss). Miller's life starts to fall apart while he is negotiating the sale, the chief catalyst being a car crash caused by his falling asleep at the wheel.  The crash kills his mistress and he sneaks away from the scene with some help. The police try to bring him to heel.What Gere portrays in this film is the very personification of arbitrage.  He is always in the market, always thinking, always leveraging and above all, dealing, dealing and then dealing some more. Although he seems to have feelings for his family and mistress, his mind never can rest on a person very long for it is always whirring, always shifting the parameters around until he finds a way out and forward.  This is both his incredible strength and his ultimate weakness. It is one heck of a performance and my favorite of his since AMERICAN GIGOLO.Other amazon reviewers have criticized the ending of the film.  I did not think it was flawed and I am going to say why but I need to put a spoiler warning in front of it as it does involve discussing the the film's ultimate resolution of this character.SPOILER........................SPOILER...................SPOILER......................SPOILER.....................SPOILER.............We end with Robert Miller (Gere) taking the microphone at a charity gala honoring him. He has just resolved some huge battles only to face another one on another front.  He has on the face he shows to the world and does not look at all intimidated. He is back in whirring mode.  His mind is going on what moves to make next.  He is used to being in tight spots.  He ENJOYS being in tight spots because they stimulate him to find a way out, to arbitrage once again. This is his entire life. He is ready for it; he is always ready for it. If he doesn't win, that is ok, as the battle is what he lives for each and every day. And, by the way, does anyone really think he doesn't have cash stashed in accounts abroad, as his wife suggests? Not me!

"The Americans is the story of a married couple of KGB spies planted in Washington DC during the Reagan era. The 1980s timeshift alone is enough to intrigue, given the heightening tensions with the USSR, and the surveillance and counter intelligence operations in a world without cell phones and laptops. But the show is carried expertly by the two principal actors who balance the demands of a family life with the complex and dangerous missions supplied by their agency, and it's really the plot of their personal lives that keeps the audience coming back for more.The show is very carefully plotted to ensure that amid growing suspense, it doesn't start to become ludicrous. As much as I loved the first season of Homeland, this is one of the flaws in its execution   by the time the screenwriters had Brody murdering the Vice President, it started to strain under its own ridiculousness. The Americans pushes the envelope with each episode but never so far to break the consistency of the characters.Although it features strong action sequences, these play second fiddle to the paranoia of managing a double life   one that involves raising children in a foreign country under a false identity, and another about infiltrating that country under the allegiance of another. This presents a dilemma for the audience too since our heroes are villains and we can't help but feel a twang of betrayal as we hope they succeed in their missions.Overall, I can't recommend The Americans enough especially if you have enjoyed Homeland or House of Cards. It's yet again another reminder that the best drama is happening on TV rather than in the movies right now.",Addictively entertaining and tightly plotted,1365206400,"04 6, 2013",5,1

"How our ancestors suffered, even a bare hundred years ago, whether they were the patients or the staff of the biggest charity hospital for the poor in turn of the century London. Medicine was advancing in 1906, just not fast enough to stem the tide of suffering brought on by injury and disease aided and abetted by poverty. Asepsis (sterile and clean conditions) had been discovered and developed as had chloroform and ether as surgical anesthetics, primitive (and dangerous) x ray technology, but antibiotics, intravenous solutions, imaging technology that didn't kill the patient on its own and a simple sugar and water solution to keep people from dying from dehydration were decades in the future, along with many, many other things.The body had been well anatomized and diseases were documented and described. The problem was the paucity of treatments that worked. The brave men and women who tried to turn the tide are everyday heroes and should remind us of the nurses who still take care of us.People suffered from birth defects, malnutrition, infectious diseases, diseases of aging and poverty, industrial accidents and gang warfare all of it grimed in a coat of dirt and vermin that the nurses struggled to stem. Every, every, everything was dirty at a time when cleaning required ten times the work it does today. Nurses were also expected to be married to the hospital, not allowed to marry or see a man romantically and this went on to the forties.The stories in London Hospital are all taken from life be it newspaper articles, hospital records or personal memoirs. The producers have also gone to some trouble to make the procedures and illnesses real in a stomach churning, toe curling manner. Other reviewers have criticized this as an attempt to shock. I agree it is shocking, but it is necessary to have even a prayer of taking the viewer back to the genuine suffering of this era. Drama with the staff is interspersed with the cases but London Hospital is a piece of medical history that is profound in its depiction and its implications. Very highly recommended but not for the faint of heart. Many of the medical scenes are truly grisly and watching the dead die all over again is affecting.

"Both Janet and Phyllis are both little old ladies. A quick glance at their houses and all would seem apple pie, until you walk through their front doors. Phyllis's living room is overstuffed with dolls, but despite wearing a down coat because she can't pay for heat, she has greeted her caller with a broad smile.  Janet's front door is hard to open because Janet's home is just too hoarded  it is stuffed like a dumpster turned campground latrine. Janet doesn't greet her visitor: Dr. Zasio (and the camera) scans the room to make out the fuzzy white head of an elderly woman peeping out from under a pale blanket, almost like it is floating, quite severed, in a sea of refuse. Shocking, disturbing, and then...the little white head giggles.Sorry if I've spoiled the first 5 minutes for you, but I was hoping to paint a picture of the eerie worlds of the two loveable hoarders featured in this episode. Both are in trouble and need lots of help. Luckily a few caring offspring and the Hoarders crew of professionals save the day!  (Because we all know if it were left to our government to step in, they would forfeit their homes and be locked up for the rest of their disenfranchised days...)

In the end making them all look tacky and bad considering that they are supposed to be such successful women.  Hope they change and go back to being more real with a little more cljazz.

The plot is fun:  several agents from different countries combine forces to solve international crimes.  In the pilot someone is killing young women and crosses international borders to do so.  As the countries haven't been working together to share information, the killer is getting away with it and appears he will continue his spree.  However, with the new elite international team formed, they hope to stop him in his tracks.  The diverse members of the team are multi talented and have strong personalities.

"I was born in 85.  But I've always had a thing for the 60s, 70s and 80s.  I collect movies and have many from those decades.  I heard about this show and set it on our DVR.  Wow, I am glad I did.  It was so funny, without seeming like it was trying to be.  It just showed a second in the life of a family in the 80s.  Each have their own uniqueness.

Hell on wheels gets much better as the program progresses from one episode to the next. If you only watched the first one or two episodes you may not be very impressed with the show at first. As the episodes progress the characters get more interesting and the story as well. The only problem with this program is that they've taken on a very big subject with a very low budget. If you go to their website and look at the production information you'll see what I mean. Considering the program renewed for another season may be the budget will be bigger and the producers will be able to present a better picture of just how grueling it was to build that railroad. If the storyline has the characters stay in one location as it would appear to be headed at the end of the first season the show will probably not see a third season. With a program like Deadwood you can have a show that is primarily character driven but when you have a show about building a railroad you need more than that. Nevertheless when the program returns in early 2013 I will definitely buy it.,Hell on wheels is very good but on a budget,1335312000,"04 25, 2012",5,1

"Watched the pilot twice in a row. It was an entire season of any great series crammed into a single 1 hour episode. How? It has the group behavioral dynamic that Walking Dead does without the zombies. Events melded well at the beginning and by the end have a nice sense among all elements. Constant movement and situation changes through the entirety. Pay attention to detail and the various quirks and motives of the cast. There is more going on than meets the eye and logic as well. I think perhaps Amazon Producer(s) pulled every trick they could to make this a seller right off. It's never too over the top, but pushes the limit. Each character is well developed from the start and if indications hold true we will see more of the group internal dynamics develop just like they have in Walking Dead... Keep in mind it hasn't been determined as yet what is actually going on. But the local area of incident is definitely in chaos. If Amazon can pull that off every episode, then it will be mjazzive competition for AMC, A&E, and FX. I might even consider changing my watch time priorities of The Blacklist or The Following in favor of this so far new take on SHTF situations that have become so popular in the past few years. In they can keep it up, they can set a new standard that will have Netflix wanting to bring something more and just as big as their current line up. Gloves off fellas. But fight fair anyway.

"I thought this was a very interesting film. I wouldnt call it a masterpiece, but what it did, it did very well. An epidemic across the globe basically gives people extreme agoraphobia while also being hypersensitive to the wide spaces to the point of having &#34;heart attacks' (they looked more like embolisms or somesuch) and dying. So, people are basically trapped underground or in whatever building they happened to be in when the pandemic, dubbed &#34;The Panic&#34; struck in widespread fashion. In a sense, this movie succeeded where movies like The Happening utterly failed. Basically, the world is reclaiming itself, and people are having to learn to adapt to their new circumstances, something that is depicted in widely variable ways, as it should be (since people respond differently to extreme scenarios). You see the best and worst of people in this movie.I feel it's a great movie to add to the must watch list, and memorable even, but as I said before, not a masterpiece per se.

"Despite its title, the Comedy Central produced ""Workaholics"" is not a traditional work place sitcom. It is a quintessential stoner slacker comedy featuring three friends as they adapt (or refuse to adapt) to the increasingly complex world of adulthood. The guys are continuously rude, obnoxious and or clueless and yet the bonds of their friendship may stretch, but never break  even when they behave in the most horrifying ways to one another. Unabashedly silly and crude, and oftentimes hilarious, this comedy makes no apologies for what it is. Not for sensitive viewers, this is in your face aggressive without a concern for political correctness or appropriateness. It is the irreverent ""anything can happen"" feel that is the core selling point for this ridiculously appealing show. I suspect that if you enjoy the wild antics of ""Workaholics,"" you will become a fervent and vocal supporter of the show. If, however, it all seems a bit juvenile for your taste  there is a good chance you will absolutely loathe this program. This could very well be a love it or hate it proposition.Season One lines up ten episodes which spend about equal time between work and other recreational activities. Some of the strongest episodes do deal specifically with the job site. In one episode, the boys vie for a promotion and their warfare against one another becomes increasingly brutal. In another, the boys organize a strike when the bosses won't recognize a completely ridiculous holiday. The season finale (with an invaluable jazzist by guest Chris Parnell as the company's CEO) has the guys fighting to save the company itself! It's all over the top and silly but that's the charm. In one of the show's most uncomfortable episodes, the boys befriend a child predator because he's a cool guy. Hey, you can't argue with that kind of reasoning!The show succeeds on the chemistry between its leads  Anders Holm, Blake Anderson, and Adam DeVine. While all fill their particular niche to perfection, it is Holm that is the stand out for me. The only character that straddles the worlds of adolescence and adulthood  he is oftentimes made the stooge for trying to be successful. Jillian Bell provides great support as an off beat co worker that gets into her share of trouble as well, and Maribeth Monroe is delightful as the boss consistently pushed over the edge of reason. This is a deft comedy of slapstick and silliness. Its humor is crude and juvenile. If you don't like that sort of thing  then, by all means, stay far away. If, however, your looking for a good fix of rude and rollicking laughs  give it a shot.

"Ike Oden, DVD Verdict   The scenarios for each episode are more or less your typical sitcom fare: the boys scheme to pjazz a drug test, the boys lie to some girls in order to get dates, the boys spend a night locked in their office, etc. Workaholics knows this well worn territory intimately and filters it through a haze of drugs, pop culture obsession, and frat boy perversion. Scatology, substance abuse and sexual deviance drive Workaholics' creative engine not as gratuitous gross out humor but as serious philosophical and personal issues for our protagonists. Pop culture is approached with a similarly solemn face, meaning boys don't reference Nickelodeon's Double Dare, Dateline's ""To Catch A Predator"" and The Insane Clown Posse as one off jokes, but as major story points within episodes.None of these innovations would coalesce if actors creators Anderson, DeVine, and Holm didn't have such spectacular comedic chemistry with one another. The trio created the show after accumulating years of improv and viral video experience together, making their ""best friend"" interplay organic and believable. Each represents a different archetype of buddy comedies  Holm is the responsible one, Anderson is the quirky guy, and DeVine is the clueless leader. With the meta use of their own names and storylines culled from real life experiences, the guys are play stylized versions of themselves (comparable to Larry David's work in Curb Your Enthusiasm) giving the show a naturally spontaneous feel that's refreshing in a sitcom.This meta premise also adds extra dimensions to the characters, letting the performers take their characters down roads that border skirt the lines of insanity and narcissism without freeing the characters of conscious and empathy. They're bros, after all, and always rely on the bond their friendship to claw their way out of whatever ridiculous problem they face each episode. Unlike the characters populating the similarly anarchic It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, it's hard not to sympathize with stoners like Blake, Adam, and Anders. They love each other, and we love them for it.Great praise must also be showered upon the show's writing. Dialogue consistently crackles with pseudo hip hop slang and some of the most creative profanity ever realized on the small screen. Not only that, but the show's ability to consistently subvert audience expectations without relying on gimmicks or false plot twists deserves a rousing applause. Though their numbers are too large to list here, accolades must be given to the writing staff and showrunners of Workaholics as some of the freshest comedy writing on television.As if I couldn't recommend Workaholics enough, Comedy Central comes through with a DVD absolutely stacked with content.The technical specs check out solidly. The show is shot on a fairly small budget, so the somewhat fuzzy 1.78.1 transfer won't blow minds, but proves serviceable for a shot on digital show about workaday potheads. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track fares a little better, boasting very clear dialogue and a thumping hip hop theme that you'll never tire of hearing.The extras that are where Workaholics: Season One really shine. Included in the set is cast interviews, deleted alternate scenes, Workaholics digital originals, a live Workaholics sketch (as performed at Bonnaroo), outtakes, and (fittingly inebriated) audio commentaries for each episode. Rather than pick apart each extra bit by bit and step on the jokes, I will only say every supplement sampled here made me laugh as hard as the show itself. If the bonus material is to be trusted, the Workaholics crew are just as hilarious outside the show as they are on it. For fans, the extras are a veritable feast of funny that spans several hours beyond the episodes featured.

"The older Dr. Who series always has a theatre quality to it. Tom Baker is the Doctor I grew up with, so it feels good to stop by and see these episodes again. This one features Romana, one of the better companions I feel (though she was kind of forced on the Doctor).Generations today always want a female Time Lord (ok by me), and well, there you go. Romana is a Time &#34;Lady&#34;. She's as smart as the Doctor, but lacks the experience he has traveling the universe.  She also seems to usually be very calm in a tight situation against his silly antics some times. They make a good pair.So if you ever wanted to see what a female Time Lord (excuse me, Lady) might be like, check out these episodes.",Good episodes,1394236800,"03 8, 2014",5,1

At this stage of my young son's life, everything is a teacher...he is a sponge, soaking in all to which he is exposed.  No better teacher than the the &#34;real   life lessons&#34; offered in Little Bill.

"This show is unlike anything I've ever watched on TV before!If you like cop shows, & supernatural mystery, then I think you'll really enjoy this series. But, Grimm isn't just any cop show!When I had watched the trailer, I really didn't know how producers were going to be able to pull off; mixing a bunch of Grimm Fairy Tale stories in with 2 cops & make it actually work. All I can say is: Not only does it work. It works incredibly well. The costumes, along with the artists who do the make up for the actors & actresses, do a phenomenal job!At the end of each episode, you're left with the feeling of not wanting it to end & wishing there was more! I like to imagine just what fairy tale monster they'll come up with next & what it'll do or look like in the following weeks to come.Oh. And, Nick is pretty easy on the eyes, too.

"Samantha Brown is delightful in showing us around the different areas.  She's witty and cheerful while being subtly candid as to problems a less than a seasoned world traveler might have.

The cast is packed with great character actors, including Daniel Dae Kim and his ""Lost"" co star Terry O'Quinn; Grace Park (of ""Battlestar Galactica""); ""Buffy"" fave James Marsters and Masi Oka hamming it up as a CSI labbie who dreams of being Columbo. The show is fun and delivers on the action while never taking itself too seriously. Lots of great footage of Oahu (and some of the other islands) and enough bikinis and sixpack abs to satisfy the shallowest of TV viewers. I'm definitely looking forward to Season Three!

"I like a good spy story.  This is a good story but it takes a while for them to get on with it.  There are 13 episodes but by episode 4 you can see the need for the saga to move faster.  But, if you hang in there and just relax with it, sooner or later you get where you need to go.  The security services in this country are portrayed in a very poor light, with the lack of inter agency information sharing being right at the top of things.  Not very flattering to the government.  Perhaps another reason why the series was cancelled.  Overall, I enjoyed it, although I had to watch the whole thing twice.  Watching it twice allowed me to pick up on the nuances and small details  those things you miss when you are trying to follow the story.  Or maybe, I'm just thick!

"I have read the entire series of Dexter novels and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Showtime has dramatized the series. Ye potential readers and viewers, be aware!! The Showtime series differs from the books in several ways. The ending of the first book and the first series are not the same. The TV version fleshes out the other characters, such as Rita. the girlfriend and the police lieutenant, La Guerta  and introduces a new character in the person of Esme. The book is an intense ride within Dexter's mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Pjazzenger. The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this, I highly recommend both. It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series. I remember Michael Hall from ""Six Feet Under"" and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also, CBS is now showing Showtime's Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm. It cuts too much from the Showtime series for my taste, but it is better than most of the junk on TV.",There is a difference between the book and the Showtime series,1205020800,"03 9, 2008",5,1

"Urban fantasy series are currently undergoing a boom    anything with vampires, werewolves and the like has an automatic audience.Enter ""Teen Wolf,"" which seems to be the lycanthropic counterpart to the ""Vampire Diaries""    lots of attractive teenage characters, secrets, violence, supernatural mysteries and some high school romance. While the main character's werewolf form is incredibly unscary, the rest of the series is quite strong    even if it does seem to use lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty.Weedy teenager Scott McCall (Tyler Posey) and his nerdy buddy Stiles (Dylan O'Brien) are prowling through a woods where a murder has recently occurred, and a large furry animal bites Scott. The following day, he finds that he's gained incredible senses, healing and agility    which allows him to become the new star of the lacrosse team.Stiles claims Scott is a werewolf, but Scott ignores him... until he starts transforming in the middle of a date with a new girl in town, Allison (Crystal Reed). Another werewolf, Derek Hale (Tyler Hoechlin) takes Scott under his wing to educate him about how to control his lycanthropic urges, since anything that raises his heart rate can transform him at a moment's notice.Even worse: there are an ancient family of werewolf hunters in the area, and it turns out that Allison's dad and sadistic aunt are among them. Also, jock Jackson (Colton Haynes) is sniffing out Scott's secret.But Scott's high school woes soon become the least of his troubles. He was turned into a werewolf by an alpha    a savage, bloodthirsty creature who is killing more people around the town. And somehow this rampage is connected to a fire that killed Derek's entire family several years ago. And if Scott doesn't join the alpha, the lives of everyone he loves will be endangered...""Teen Wolf"" hits a solid balance of teen romance, dark action, gore, horror and dry comedy. It's hard to get all those elements in the right proportions, but for the most part the series gets it right. The only problem is that a few episodes are a little too heavy on the teen soap opera romance (oh noes! Scott is making out with Jackson's girlfriend whom Stiles is also crushing on! ANGST! DRAMA!).But when the focus is on the werewolf stuff, ""Teen Wolf"" shines    there's lots of growling, misty woods, and bloody violence, and the writers throw some curveballs at the audience (just who what IS that vet?!). There's also an atmosphere of growing tension and darkness, which grows stronger as the season unfolds. Fortunately, the writers know how to leaven the story with plenty of humor, usually from Stiles (""What did I sound like to you?"" ""Like a cat being choked to death"").The special effects are a little dodgy. Some of them (like the alpha werewolf form) are decent, but the CGI werewolf maws are sometimes goofy looking    and the beta werewolf form is not scary AT ALL.The cast is pretty uniformly solid    even seemingly cliched characters like Lydia (the Queen Bee Mean Girl), Chris Argent (Allison's scary werewolf hunter dad) and Jackson (the arrogant jock who desperately wants to be a werewolf) are well rounded, with excellent reasons for them to act and feel as they do. Posey, Hoechlin and O'Brien make a solid central trio as the earnest good boy, the tall dark and brooding bad boy, and the nerdy sidekick respectively, and they all have excellent chemistry.""Teen Wolf"" has a few freshman wobbles, but overall it's a sleek, eerie story that balances action, romance and horror in equal measure.

"At the end of Season 5, in the aftermath of Jenny Sheppard's murder, Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance  with Carroll drawing liberally from Daniel Benzali's Robert Quinn on ""The Agency"" (Remember, Carroll was part of the ensemble of that series in the early part of this decade) had rejazzigned Jethro Gibbs' three field agents  sending Tony DiNozzo to be an agent afloat, Tim McGee to the Cybercrimes Unit, and Ziva David back to Mossad  and had given Gibbs a new team.Well...PSYCHE.The main theme of this season  which famously kicks off with Ziva, in that killer blue backless dress, singing ""Temptation"" in a speakeasy just before a bomb goes off  is a theme of trust; with the inital eight episodes being woven around the investigation of a mole within the MTAC, and leading into the deeper storyline of David's allegiances being questioned...as well as her relationship with a male Mossad agent.  I'm sorry, that's what piques Tony's interest...The actors at this point are wearing their characters as they would a good, comfortable pair of shoes.  Mark Harmon's Gibbs is in a relationship more adversarial with Vance than he was with Sheppard (Not really a surprise, given Jethro's history with Sheppard), but is still the driving force of the team.  Michael Weatherly is still having fun with the intrusive, horny DiNozzo; but it is also at the point that Tony is REALLY beginning to have Ziva issues.  I've often talked about the dynamic between Weatherly and Cote De Pablo as being reminiscent of David Addison and Maddie Hayes from ""Moonlighting"", but this relationship also is vaguely reminiscent of the Harmon Rabb Sarah MacKenzie relationship from NCIS's father series, JAG.  Sean Murray's Tim McGee has grown by leaps and bounds in terms of confidence  especially when dealing with DiNozzo, though he still has a healthy fear of Ziva (Especially when Z finds that McGee still has a picture of her in the bikini from Sheppard's ill fated California trip).  We have to concede that NO ONE ELSE could have given Abby Sciutto the life and energy that Pauley Perrette has, just as no one else other than David McCallum could have given life to Donald Mallard.  It's good that Brian Dietzen has finally been given ""Also Starring"" status in the opening block credits.I've tried to make the point that Rocky Carroll's Leon Vance has changed the dynamic of the office.  In many ways, Jethro could always find some way to push the previous director's buttons  and wouldn't hesitate to do as much...but Vance seems much more of a mystery to Gibbs; and keeps his cards to his chest about situations.One of the highlights of the first eight episodes  ""The Traitor in The MTAC"" storyline  is ""Heartland"", another one of the ""Who Is Jethro Gibbs?"" stories that we get once or twice a season now.  This episode is an investigation of the beating of a Marine from Gibbs' hometown, taking Jethro home and introducing the viewers to his pleasant and charming father, Jackson, and has the father and son resolving some long held differences.  That Papa John Walton himself  Ralph Waite  gave a gusto to the elder Gibbs the viewers took to, it will be nice to see Jack return every so often.I've said many times about this series that it's the recurring characters around Gibbs and the team that make the series go, and this season is no exception.  We start with Liza Lapira and Jonathan LaPaglia in the ""Traitor"" arc; Lapira's tragic turn (And the look between Michelle Lee and Jimmy Palmer in the opener...), the introduction of Mark Harmon's son Sean playing Jethro in flashbacks  especially ""Heartland"" where Jethro learns about ""the rules"" and the surprise of who teaches him about them...Jude Ciccolella turns as Secretary of The Navy...Joe Spano's annual visits as Gibbs' rival friend Tobias Fornell...the always entertaining Muse Watson as Gibbs' bend the rules mentor from when Jethro was a ""probie"", Mike Franks...and David Dayan Fisher's Trent Kort, who still seems to operate on agenda...and not necessarily the Company's agenda.The second storyline  whether Mossad has compromised Ziva, and her connection to the agent jazzasin Michael Rivkin (Merik Tadros, who brings some echoes of Rudolf Martin's Ari Haswari from the first two seasons)is the more dominant story of the season, and does more to shake the team to the point that Ziva chooses to stay in Israel at the end of the season.This plays as a season of growth  the relationship entity the fan base now calls ""Tiva"", Gibbs showing more of his history character, Ziva showing that she CAN be shaken...the relationship between Vance and Gibbs and the surprises that Gibbs DIDN'T know...Absolutely recommended.","NCIS Season 6--Complications, Deadlines, Commitments...",1266364800,"02 17, 2010",5,1

"This is truly America's most existential long form series. I can't stop watching it, which underscores a kind of cultural mental illness I have contracted about applauding for nihilism and wrath as staples in my already jaundiced video diet (""Justified,"" ""Breaking Bad,"" etc.). Here we have a story based loosely on Shakespeare's ""Hamlet,""  re imagined by Sam Pekinpah. The biker policy gang arc is that these boys will sell guns and lethal weapons, but do not want to soil their well earned townie reputation by dabbling in the drug trade. Think about that for one second. Time's up. Now the Hamlet figure, Jax, wants to divest himself of this because his dead father appears as a ""ghost journal"" that Jax reads on the roof of his truck auto bike repair castle warning him that this gun business is the road to nowheresville. So Jax makes a ton of promises, all of which are broken. And in the wake of these broken promises, there's a body count second to none on TV, and the ones Jax truly loves  his wife and two kids  are betrayed over and over, promise after promise  I give you my word! Meantime, his stepfather, Clay, who is the Claudius figure, is so loathsome, that if promises were bullets we would be riddled right out of this story in one season. But he hangs on, defying every moral fiber in Jax's being and every thematic turn of logic. By the third season these guys are so knee deep in moral sewerage that it defies common sense that a fourth and fifth season could punctuate the circle of deceit devouring these promise keepers. But somehow they do it, and its entertaining, morally unfathomable as to why it's entertaining, but I guess that's what makes existentialism the emerging philosophy of America. Gone is our pragmatism; we now welcome the moral carnage of our own powerlessness to hope for anything better.",Fear & Trembling & Sickness Unto Death,1356307200,"12 24, 2012",4,1
"Endgam3TV Series60 minCrime DramaCreator: Avrum JacobsonStars: Shawn Doyle, Patrick Gallagher, Katharine IsabelleIf you are a fan of TV detective series with a twist you will probably like Endgame.

After his wife's death in a drive by killing he fears the outside to such a degree he has panic attacks when he gets near an exit.  He enlists the aid of a hotel maid, bartender, and security staff along with a college student to jazzist him in solving cases at the Hotel and elsewhere.

"After a week off, Dollhouse returned with ""Haunted,"" another wonderful, high octane episode that brings a completely new dimension to the concept behind the series. This brings up even more ethical questions about the Dollhouse that I've never thought of before, and makes the viewer think a little bit harder about characters in the show.After Adelle's wealthy friend, Margaret, dies, she imprints the woman's memories into Echo allowing her, in a sense, to have a kind of life after death. Adelle and Echo Margaret attend the woman's funeral, since she wonders just how many people actually loved her when she was alive. After some unexpected happenings at the funeral, Margaret decides that she wants to find out who killed her.Past this point the viewers are thrown into a surprising original twist on the age old ""whodunnit"" murder mystery (complete with typical line up of suspects, all this motives). I thought this was a fresh and much welcome departure from the rest of the series and allowed Dollhouse to add a little mystery into the mix. The entire plot was perfectly put together and filled with intense surprises that kept me guessing up until the very end.The story's unique approach also forces viewers to think a little harder about what kind of world they will leave behind after they die. Are their relationships and lives just as they imagine them to be, or are there some sinister secrets lurking underneath it all?Back at the Dollhouse, it's time for Topher annual ""diagnostic test."" The purpose behind this isn't really explained, but it results in Topher imprinting Sierra with a personality that makes her the perfect nerd friend for him, complete with knowledge of MMORPGs, laser tag, Xbox 360 and science y stuff. While these scenes are absolutely hilarious and feature great dialogue, they are serve as a kind of window into Topher's character  and just how lonely he is.Topher's not the only lonely one. Agent Bellard is feeling lonelier by the minute as he wrestles with the truth of Mellie's identity. As Bellard pushes closer to the Dollhouse, he makes a believer in the FBI office after the two try to investigate Mellie's past.In the end the mystery of Margaret's death comes to a satisfying conclusion, despite the unbelievable idea that Margaret willingly gives up her stay in Echo's body and potential eternal life. However, I can easily overlook this detail after the rest of ""Haunted"" kept me guessing the entire time.Sadly, there are strong rumors going around that Dollhouse is going to be canceled after the first season  just like Fox cancels all of its good shows. I've also read online that Fox will not air the final episode of the season, but Joss and co. are planning to include it on the DVD.",Murder Mystery -Dollhouse style,1240790400,"04 27, 2009",5,1
"STEVEN SPIELBERG HIT the television world with a bang two seasons ago, producing ""Terra Nova,"" ""Smash,"" ""The River"" and ""Falling Skies."" It was a shock when three of the four diverse shows were eventually cancelled. I mean, c'mon   this is Spielberg.But audiences loved TNT's science fiction gem ""Falling Skies"" about evil aliens invading and conquering Earth, and the interracial band of men and women who used guerrilla warfare and lots of heart to fight back.""Falling Skies: Season One"" took us directly into the conflict months after the invasion. We only see the aliens from the human's viewpoint and those bad boys mean business. Cities have been destroyed, the population decimated and children have been captured and used as slave labor, rigged up with symbiotic harnesses that link them directly to the enemy. A hardy band of rebels   consisting of Capt. Dan Weaver (Will Patton), history professor Tom Mason (Noah Wylie in his best work since ""E.R."") and his sons (Maxim Knight, Connor Jessup and Drew Roy), Doctor Anne Gljazz (Moon Bloodgood) and biker renegade John Pope (Colin Cunningham)   link up, sometimes willingly, sometimes not, to take back the world.Will Wheaton hosts ""2nd Watch: Episode 20 `A More Perfect Union,'"" where a cast roundtable explores the struggles faced in Season Two. It's one of the lively features on the set. Wheaton tells us that John Rogers, co creator of TNT's ""Leverage,"" said, ""They wrote themselves into such a corner at the end of the first season, and this entire season has just paid this off so well.""Season Two ""had to be bigger, badder, had to move faster   Had to be cooler,"" executive producer Remi Aubuchon says in the feature, ""One Page at a Time: Writing the 2nd American Revolution.""Even with all that enthusiasm Aubuchon was shocked to find no one had any plans to move past Tom walking into the alien spacecraft.Writers and producers finally asked the big question: What's the most interesting way to bring Tom back? We discover Tom has been held for months and tortured by the aliens. When he's allowed to escape and gets back to the rebel unit   the 2nd Mjazzachusetts, named after the 1777 regiment of the Continental Army   Tom tells Capt. Weaver he can't trust himself. Have the aliens done something to him that would cause him to betray his people?That's one of the mysteries of Season Two. We also find out how Tom's sons and the rest of the 2nd Mjazz survived without him, where they are now, and where they hope to go. These 10 episodes uncover more answers and open more mysteries   a challenging opening to Season Three.The high def visuals and immersive sound give Season Two the look of quality film. Extras provide a wealth of information. Short featurettes include ""Terry O'Quinn is Manchester,"" ""Team Skitter,"" and ""The Fans' Perspective: Touring the Set of `Falling Skies.'"" In ""Designing the Spaceship,"" co executive producer director Greg Beeman says Spielberg was ""very involved."" ""They [the aliens] grow their computer system biologically. It's kind of a big nervous system,"" he tells us. Aubuchon credits Spielberg for ""Creating the Crawlies,"" another alien baddie, in that featurette. Apparently, when the studio questioned a design or effect, techs learned to say, ""Well, that's the way Stephen wants it."" Enough said.Commentary on premier episode ""Worlds Apart"" with Wylie, Beeman and writer Mark Verheiden; ""Molon Labe,"" with Wyle, Aubuchon and writers Bradley Thompson and David Weddle; and season finale ""A More Perfect Union"" with Wylie, Aubuchon, and writers Thompson and Weddle are informative and good listening.Still, the best thing is the story   the battle of good versus evil.""Things can only get worse, Tom, and none of us wants that to happen,"" alien puppet Karen Nadler (Jessy Schram) warns our Colonial inspired fighters.Ha   bring it on, baby.

"Quaint, enchanting, cute   these aren't words normally jazzociated with films about a haunting, but they are more than apt for describing The Innkeepers.  If you're wondering if this can even be considered a horror movie, I can jazzure you that it does earn its horror chops when all is said and done (although I think the trailer oversells the scare factor).  What I took away from the movie, though, was a rather poignant sense of melancholy.  You aren't going to find many horror films that run you through such a gamut of emotions as this one.  It's an unconventional but really impressive piece of work from writer director Ti West.The setting is the historic Yankee Pedlar Inn, on the final weekend before it closes its doors forever.  With only one floor open and three rooms booked, young Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) are all the only employees left to see the inn through its final days and hours.  Their focus, however, is in trying to prove that the venerable old hotel is indeed haunted   supposedly by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a young bride who reportedly hanged herself when her lover abandoned her on her wedding day.  Luke has created a web site about sightings of the ghost, but it is Claire who seems fixated on making contact with Madeline before the inn closes its doors forever.  Claire is quite a character   young, unfocused, highly excitable, and just incredibly cute.  She definitely doesn't seem to have the temperament of a ghost hunter, as several comical scenes early on make clear.  Personally, I found her infatuating, and I thought Sara Paxton's portrayal of her was almost magical.  Kelly McGillis also turns in a strong performance as actress turned new age healer Leanne Rease Jones, a character who comes to play a crucial and prophetic part in the story.The Innkeepers is devilishly hard to describe.  In a way, much of the story is predictable, yet at the same time it's also rather shocking in the end.  The writing is subtly brilliant.  The significance of some lines early in the movie only hit you later on, even after the film is over.  It sounds stupid for me to describe the story as both conventional and unconventional, but I think that is a true statement.  Those who like their scares blatant and numerous probably won't like the film, as it's really not a scarefest.  The Innkeepers is a ghost story in the traditional sense, full of subtle nuance and dare I say intellect, playing out in a little world where the characters are more important than the events that befall them.  I loved it.","A charming, surprisingly complex, good old-fashioned ghost story",1350777600,"10 21, 2012",5,1

"NO SPOILERS!Of all of the TV that I watch (including DVD's of foreign programming) there are very few US network programs that I pull off the DVR shortly after an episode is completed.

"This show is a cerebral psychological thriller for ""grown folks"". So those of you that need fast moving objects & over stimulation (many gross sex scenes & many extremely violent bloody murder scenes) this isn't for you. It has just enough gore, not so much where you're like ""WTH!? That's enough!"" and turn it off in frustration. I do cringe & turn my head during a few scenes like ""Ewwww!"" (like when Lecter is in his fancy back room butcher shop slicing up long pig for diner lol) but like I said they don't overdo it.The writer truly is talented. In 2014 he's able to hold every one's attention with brilliant content without including graphic sex or murder scenes. Gosh, there isn't very much ""foul language"" use either. Most of these so called popular shows cannot resist writing in as many softcore hardcore p0rnographic scenes as possible *cough*every show on HBO*cough* You'd expect a show (these days) about a ""cannibal"" to show some wild feral individual kidnapping, chopping up & eating people 24 7. Hannibal is cljazzy cultured individual with a degree in Psychology, he has responsibilities, he's a respected professional & consultant, he has a career, a mortgage and works hard at keep up his social veneer. It's just interesting to watch how Hannibal continues to manipulate & dupe every one, except poor Wil Gram. Anyone else that has gotten a peek at the real him was fricjazzeed (wow@ how they always show the recipe he's going to use right before he gets to cookin' haha). Hannibal has done Wil all sorts of WRONG, but I think in Hannibal's sick mind, he REALLY is fond of Wil and sees him as his friend (same way he was fond of Clarice & that Orderly). Yeah, I know ""with friends like him blah blah etc."" but he has done EVERYTHING to avoid killing & eating Will, and now it's obvious that Lecter is trying to exculpate Wil of this current charges.I'm glad they don't have the characters doing unbelievably stupid things to get themselves killed, p!ssing me off & making me cuss at the screen *ha* but they ARE pushing it with that lady FBI agent. I won't spoil it for others, but in this last episode.....I swear I wanted to slap her.

"Pretty depressing, but pretty compelling, too. Dakota Fanning plays Lewellen, the lead character, to perfection. Even if the movie were no good otherwise, I'd recommend it just to see how such a young actress can make you believe you're really in the middle of a story, seeing a real little girl in her real life. She raises protective instincts in most of the audience, and I don't want to think about what she raises in the rest.Lewellen is 12 years old, lives with her father (David Morse) in a run down house in a run down part of the south; near Nashville, I think. Her mother is gone, but it is not clear where or why. Her maternal grandmother (Piper Laurie) lives nearby, and is a fundamentalist authoritarian who seems to be always angry, always saying no.Lewellen loves to imitate Elvis, singing ""Hounddog"" with a floor lamp for a microphone, and all the hip movements. She is therefore shocked when her friend Charlie introduces her to Big Mama Thornton, who sang it ""all wrong,"" because Lewellen figured it was Elvis' song. But in fact Thornton had recorded it years before Elvis.Lewellen says she can't sing the blues because she isn't black. Charlie explains that singing the blues isn't just for black folks, and cites Elvis as an example. Hounddog thus becomes a symbol of Lewellen's emotional development, when she can sing from the heart and not merely from imitation.But the story is not primarily about music. It's about the vulnerability of a young girl to injustice, to the demands and whims of adults, and even of older children. But it's also about her inner strength, her sense of responsibility in caring for her father after he is struck by lightening and ""turned stupid,"" as her friend's father put it. Believe me, he was not the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree before the lightning hit his tractor.The dynamics of the family life, and facts about the past unfold slowly, and I'm not going to spoil those revelations for you. But I do have one nagging question. Early in the story, Daddy has a Stranger Lady move in for awhile. The credits list this as Robin Wright Penn. Later we get to know another lady who is perhaps Lewellen's mother or her aunt; in any case, the daughter Grannie rejected. She looks a lot like Stranger Lady, but I'm not sure. There is some critical information in knowing this, and it bothers me that I am not good enough at recognizing and remembering faces to be sure.

"This one caught my eye because I am a fan of David Tennant (""Blackpool"") so it really was a pig in a poke. What I bought was actually a lovely little romantic comedy that has some of the wittiest dialogue I've had the pleasure to hear, no bad guys, and several people to root for.We are on a remote island in the Hebrides where an internationally known movie star is trying to get married without the army of paparazzi who relentlessly hound her tracks. Her publicist and her staff have scouted out a castle on this particular island based on her favorite book written by her fianc&eacute;. They need a decoy to lure the photographers off the scent.Here are some of the actors:* Alice Eve (""Star Trek into Darkness"") is that famous actress. Not only is she famous, she's smart, kind, talented and resourceful.* David Tennant (""Blackpool"") is the author of her favorite book. He now  has writer's block but is completely agog over his famous fianc&eacute;e.* Kelly MacDonald (""Boardwalk Empire"") is a local girl come home to lick her wounds. She followed a musician to London but discovered she still has a knack for finding guys who have a fear of commitment.Our actress's staff decides to do a pretend wedding to throw the paparazzi off track. They offer our local girl a LOT of cash; it's tempting because her terminally ill mother wants to see the world before she dies.This is a cheery little film with charming people, an off beat hamlet, eccentric locals and lovely scenery.

"For the second season of this wonderful mystery comedy show, the producers wisely left things pretty much alone.  Shawn Spenser (James Roday) comes from a long line of cops.  But he rebelled against his father's (Corbin Bernsen) wishes and didn't become a cop.  Instead, he pretends to be a psychic, using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his ""visions.""  He's even opened Psych, a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton ""Gus"" Guster (Dule Hill).  And he has an impressive track record, much to the dismay of Detective Ljazziter (Timothy Omundsun).  Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick (Kirsten Nelson).And what a collection of cases they have this year, too.  Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge (played by Tim Curry).  They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house.  Shawn must clear Gus' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank.  When Gus' uncle (guest star John Amos) comes for a visit, Shawn and Gus have to switch places, without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it.  Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her.  Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur.  And in the season finale, Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now.  The mysteries are tight and confusing.  I might piece things together a little before Shawn, but not by much.  And it doesn't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end.  The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year (and that's a good thing), but there is still plenty of laughs.  You've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus, comedy from the character's relationships, comedy from the situations, and some physical humor.  I can't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show.  And the cast does a great job holding it all together.  They bring high energy to each episode, but they keep it real.If you have missed this show, you have definitely missed out.  Don't let another day go by without becoming a fan.",The Funniest Mystery Show Ever,1215648000,"07 10, 2008",5,1
"EVEN THE RAIN (Tambi&eacute;n la lluvia) is a brilliant metaphor of a story written by Paul Laverty based on an actual event and directed with considerable skill by Ic&iacute;ar Bolla&iacute;n, the great Spanish actress, writer and director. This film is one of those rare 'docudramas' that bring to light historical 'secrets' that beg to be shared. In 2000 an American water company bought the water supply from the Bolivian government and the citizens of Bolivia were banned from collecting rainwater which had become corporate property. This resulted in a violent protest against the government by the indigenous Indians and the citizenry of Cochambamba, Bolivia who claimed their rights to the natural gifts of nature   even the rain. Laverty and Bolla&iacute;n expose this injustice through a well conceived story within a story.Spanish film director Sebasti&aacute;n (Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal), his cynical producer Costa (Luis Tosar), and crew including Ant&oacute;n (Karra Elejalde) have come to Cochabamba, Bolivia to shoot their film about Christopher Columbus (played by actor Ant&oacute;n   Karra Elejalde) and his first explorations, revealing the way the Spaniards treated the native Indians: Costa has chosen the place because he can get cheap labor in using local actors and extras to keep within the small budget of the film. Sebasti&aacute;n is the compjazzionate one who wants the Indians treated well, hiring a mouthy young Indian named Hatuey Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) when he claims he and his family are being unjustly overlooked as actor candidates. The filming goes well, with the exception of some minor glitches for particular scenes the Indians find too dangerous, until a conflict develops over the governmental privatization of the water supply. Daniel becomes an activist against the government who plan a 300% increase in price of water   the average daily income for the Indians is $2. a day!   and the conditions in the city become unfriendly for the film to continue. Bloody violence and chaos breakout and many citizens are being killed or jailed. It is at this point that the caring Sebasti&aacute;n finally decides that he and his crew must flee, and with some role reversal, Costa stays behind to protect Daniel's family.According to Bolla&iacute;n, 'It was the gold 500 years ago, and now it's the water, which is the gold of the 21st century. Before it was the Crown of Spain and the pope who approved the conquest. Now it is the new theologians, the IMF and the World Bank. Again it's the word from above, saying, 'This is right.' The Spanish filmmakers in the film within a film are caught in the middle. They have the attitude of neo conquerors   they go there because it's cheap. But they're also trying to make a film that casts a different look on the conquest. And it's an adventure.'Iciar Bolla&iacute;n directs this epic film with great dignity and with a keen observation of how history, even inadvertently, repeats itself. The cinematography by Alex Catal&aacute;n and the musical score by Alberto Iglesias add immeasurably to the film's success.  The cast of extras is exceptional and very well directed. Both Gael Garc&iacute;a Bernal and Luis Tosar deliver intensely considered performances as does Juan Carlos Aduviri as the key central figure Daniel. Hopefully this film, nominated for Best Foreign Film in the 2010 Academy Awards. In Spanish with English subtitles.

"Spoilers coming....This new version of Trek, with young actors playing the younger versions of the TOS crew, is exciting from beginning to end, with lots of action, adventure, humor, and creativity.  You have to keep up with the time travel twists, courtesy of LOST co creator JJ Abrams.  And a certain very important planet filled with pointy eared folk disappears. This makes certain events of the later series impossible.  You might also find it odd that Spock and Uhura have a thing for each other and don't hide it, that Sulu carries a sword into battle, that some Romulans have tattoos, and that Sarek looks awfully old and is awfully nice to young Spock  much nicer than he was in TOS.  Chris Pine has blue eyes, which Kirk never did.  And Uhura is little more than eye candy.If you can handle all of that, though, you will like the movie.  The fellow playing Chekov is adorable, while Karl Urban really takes the cake as McCoy.  Zachary Quinto is a marvel as Spock.  It would be nice to see more prequels, actually.

"I have watched both the X Men series and Iron Man series and I really thought this one was the best of the three. I thought X Men series had no action at all and should not even been called X Men series. It was more of them just standing sitting around and talking about their enemies and who is behind all of this events happening. If they weren't doing that than they would be standing sitting around and playing mind games with each other. The ""actually fighting"" would last about 30 seconds or so for each show. Not an action pack series at all. Iron Man was much better than X Men, but not as good as Blade.What makes Blade better than the other two series? It has the right storyline, action, and characters mix all in one. In every show, you will get to see Blade ""actually fighting"" and he is kicking butt at it. He also knows how to fight and talk at the same time. Amazing!The series has rememberable characters and are used well to make a great story. They really try to build up every main character and talked the why they are fighting the vampires. Each one has their own story to tell and each one has a different reason for fighting. Even the main villain story gets told in full to why he is the main villain. I started to really care for each character more and more as I learned more about them more.I love how in this show has Blade doing special deadly sword techniques. He would kill harder and tougher enemies with his special sword techniques. Also, they slowly introduce each sword technique he knows how to do. This was done very well in the series as they didn't rush it all in. I started to think how many does he know? How many are there? Blade starts doing harder more advantage sword technique as his enemies get harder to kill. Well done, I thought.If you were disappointed with Iron Man or X Men series than you need to watch this show because this one is way better than those two series!",This series was way better than X-Men or Iron Man,1340755200,"06 27, 2012",5,1

"PLOT SPOILER REVIEWTodd (Greg Kinnear) is a preacher who works one day a week, is given a home and has trouble with bills in a small Nebraska town. After letting his son have a high fever for four days, he takes him to the hospital where the son Colton, (Connor Corum) becomes delusional, sees Jesus and imagines he can act. After being read a story about animals, he claims Jesus had a rainbow colored horse. After a funeral of an old veteran, Colton claims he saw Todd's grandfather. Todd shows him a picture of his grandfather and almost as if prompted, says, yup that is him. The child also knew that mom had a miscarriage and lost a baby, something I knew as a child growing up. i.e. it is not that remarkable that he knew about it. Seems the kid added to the story as things went along.The story allows believers and skeptics to take away what they want from the tale. For Christians it is a feel good story affirmation that their blue green eyed Jesus with a neatly trimmed beard and curly locks is real. The film supplies enough information for the skeptic as Todd seeks out help and is told, &#34;There are many explanations.&#34;This is a far better film than &#34;God's Not Dead&#34; and more inspirational.3 1 2 stars","HEAVEN IS FOR REAL.

"Imagine being able to see hold touch your deceased loved ones again.  It is a dream that countless individuals wish on a daily basis.  In &#34;Resurrection&#34;, that dream becomes a reality.  Through some up and down storytelling over this initial 8 episode run, the emotional center of the material is enough to make this a solid new TV entry.For a basic plot summary, &#34;Resurrection&#34; tells the story of the town of Arcadia, Missouri.  After having drowned as a child many years ago, Jacob Langston (Landon Gimenez) suddenly shows up again the care of government agent J. Martin Bellamy (Omar Epps).  Jacob's parents (played by Frances Fisher & Kurtwood Smith) are overjoyed upon the return of their little Jacob (still the same age as his &#34;death&#34;).  With the help of Maggie (Devin Kelley), Agent Bellamy starts to put together the pieces of this giant mystery as more &#34;returned&#34; arrive in Arcadia as well.  Pastor Tom Hale (Mark Hildreth), Sheriff Fred Langston (Matt Craven), and Caleb Richards (Sam Hazeldine) also play major roles in deciphering the mystery of Arcadia.&#34;Resurrection&#34; is not a perfect show by any means.  In fact, I'd say that about half of these episodes were &#34;really good&#34;, while the other half were &#34;just okay&#34;.  In just an eight episode run, that is a few too many &#34;average&#34; episodes than I would like to see.However, through that up and down writing, there were two primary reasons why I kept tuning in every week:1. The Mystery.  There aren't too many real, honest to goodness over arching mysteries on TV anymore (&#34;case of the week&#34; shows pretty much rule the roost), and &#34;Resurrection&#34; most definitely counts as a mystery?  Who what are the returned?  Why the specific individuals?  For what purpose?  Why Arcadia?  These eight episodes have just begun to scratch the surface of what could lie ahead.2. The Emotion. Every single time a member of Arcadia connects with a long departed loved one, I got a twinge of emotion.  It is just such a human characteristic to want to &#34;get back&#34; the people we loved.  Even in the episodes that I thought dragged a bit plot wise, there was always a moment that would bring a lump to my throat in terms of emotion.Overall, &#34;Resurrection&#34; was my favorite new show of the 2013 2014 TV season.  It has mystery, emotion, great acting, and a surreal concept.  I am excited to see where the show creators can take this concept with a second season!",An Emotional Concept We Can All Relate To,1399507200,"05 8, 2014",4,1

"If only the budget for this exceptionally good series had been what could have been offered today!  This is the epitome of good writing put together with excellent acting and plausible human characters fleshed out in detail and given properly understandable motives for their actions,so that their talk and behavior seems like real people doing real things in real time.  The intricacies of their relationships and the development of the characters across the different episodes is plausible and entrancing.  The interpretation of some historical events is plausible as imaginative pseudo fiction, even if disputed by some experts, and cannot be fully supported by historical sources (many of which are lost).  However the detective work in putting together a credible theme running through the mysterious events of the Julio Claudian family was, after all, done by a writer who was thoroughly versed in cljazzical history and he made a decent stab at interpreting what he read and at bringing it to life.It casts into stark relief the poverty of plot, research and writing of such recent disasters as Vikings and Rome",Three dimensional characters in well written and imaginative screenplay,1379116800,"09 14, 2013",5,1

"I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show.  This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under.  Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people.  This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely.  Is Dexter a good or bad person?  How do we really feel about him?  How does he really feel about himself?  At the time we are exploring the story, Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each pjazzing day (or episode).  The show is brilliantly done.  I've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story.  To build the story up, the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters.  I am just so impressed with the work.  They can even make me angry because I'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way.

"This is the first season of NYPD Blue that you can watch in widescreen HD.  It is phenomenal to see such a fantastic show in wondrous WS HD.  This season is set just post 9 11, and 9 11 was addressed tangentially but doesn't really drive the stories or anything.  This season brings Danny Sorenson's replacement, John Clark.  So, the kid from Silver Spoons (who I thought was great) is replaced by the kid from Saved by the Bell.  Mark Paul Gosselaar is excellent and hits the ground running, making a fine addition to the show in the wake of Rick Schroder's departure.  One of his character's first interactions with Sipowicz is to say he thought Sipowicz was acting like a d*ck.  He's holding his own in Sipowicz's world, and the whole show is really firing on all cylinders  even though at this point the only regulars left are perhaps just Sipowicz and Medvoy.  The growing relationship between Sipowicz and McDowell is better fleshed out that I had remembered.  At times, Charlotte Ross's character's pain is quite moving, and you can better see where and why things are headed with the two of them than I realized on my first time through this show (which, admittedly, was over a decade ago, and I was an inconsistent viewer at best at that time just due to being busy).  They just don't make TV this good anymore.  Watch a couple episodes of NYPD in it's NINTH season (when it should, by all accounts, be as stale and paint by numbers as it could get) and then watch [insert any cop detective drama on network television in the past 5 years] and you'll see what I mean.  But do yourself a favor  if you haven't ever watched NYPD Blue, start at the beginning (square, SD picture and all) and work your way through the whole show from the start.  It is a moving, wild ride that will not let you down.  It is amazing that this show is still so good in its ninth season and that there are three seasons after this one to still experience!

"I read the first book of the Strain trilogy a couple years ago, which pretty much says it all. I like Guillermo Del Toro as a film maker, but my feelings about his skills as a novelist, or Chuck Hogan's skills as a novelist, are not very positive. I made my way through a largely forgettable book that was heavily influenced by Dan Simmon's horror cljazzic, 'Carrion Comfort', and Richard Matheson's 'I Am Legend', or at least his notion of a vampire virus, looking at vampires as a epidemiological threat, instead of a supernatural one. It was alright, but not good enough that I bothered picking up the second or third installments when they appeared. There's too many great books out there to waste time on mediocre brain candy. So, my hopes for the FX series were not high, but I felt that if Del Toro was involved enough, this might be a rare instance of an adaptation that surpjazzes the source in quality.The first 15 minutes or so had me wincing at some of the dialogue. The discussion of who was going to enter the plane first was just idiotic; there was absolutely no evidence of a contagion on board, why were the CDC even there? A counter terrorist strike team in gas masks should have secured the scene, no question [[NOTE: Apparently the CDC IS the first to enter a 'dead plane'   my mistake]]. But Ephraim's little speech    'How many times do you touch your face?... you can't negotiate with a virus, you can't reason with a virus...'    somehow convinced them. Never mind that everyone alive has heard variations on those cliched, overplayed words many times before, and a real cop would have laughed and told him to STFU halfway through such a condescending, pretentious rant... but whatever. Pilots are often a bit uneven, they try too hard, they don't try hard enough. One producer says lets do something crazy and different, another producer says no, there's time for that later, we don't want to scare viewers off, let's be conservative (which means predictable, formulaic crap).Thankfully, after an awkward start, the show picks up momentum when the CDC enter the plane in hazmat type containment suits to investigate. I began to recognize and recall the elements of the story that I liked, and that do, in fact, work much better on the screen than they did on the page. There are way too many terrible books and films and TV shows that feature vampires, and you would think that after Twilight and every other teenage soap opera has defanged and hypersexualized the vampire, turning the monstrous Nosferatu into a pretty boy wearing eyeliner, that it's done for in the realm of serious horror. Near Dark and John Carpenter's Vampires and Blade II aside, they haven't been menacing for a long time.The Strain is dead set on making Vampires into something more horrifying and disgusting than they've ever been before. The first feeding we see clearly in the warehouse is as shockingly violent as I could have hoped for, and the final revelation as to the 'carrier' of the virus, as the coroner conducts his autopsies... is well worth watching.The Strain was definitely a project FX believed in, and they backed up that faith with a good size budget.  The money was put to good use; the pilot episode is more like a feature film, with excellent cinematography that utilizes vibrant, over saturated colors to dramatic effect, a running time of over 70 minutes, and a large cast of mostly unknown actors, with the exception of Sean Astin and a couple semi familiar faces (i.e. the actor who played Lord Frey in Game of Thrones).If this episode is any indication (and why wouldn't it be?), The Strain is going to be a very entertaining series and a hit for FX. The  action sequences are not going to be a problem. What might be is the 'down time', so to speak, the obligatory character development and establishing the relationship between the lead character, Ephraim, and his already alienated family. The show runners almost drove me off in the opening minutes with lazy, hackneyed writing, but so far, this is probably closer to what Del Toro envisioned than the book. But then, I never read volumes 2 or 3    who knows, maybe they were great? I'll give this series time to build on their successes and work out the kinks. 78 100",Introducing a Vampire That Will Not Adorn Posters Aimed At Teenage Girls,1405555200,"07 17, 2014",4,1

"First, let me say that I'm one of those people who love both the original Doctor Who and the new version. While I prefer the long storytelling of the old ones, and not so much the frenetic pace of the new, I love the characterizations and the stories themselves. The show manages to stay new and fresh while still maintaining the old ties. The go to great lengths to make sure the audience knows that this is still the same Time Lord he's always been, and everything from slight tips of the hat to out and out tributes to the old show abound. This latest &#34;half season&#34; continues to explore how a character can die   twice, no less   and still continue to be a character. Jenna Louise Coleman is delightful as Clara 'The Impossible Girl', and Matt Smith, the youngest actor ever to essay the role, is still playing The Doctor as both hyperactive and terribly old and tired at the same time, and pulling it off with grand style. Many years ago, during a discussion of which Doctor was &#34;best&#34; or &#34;favorite&#34;, I paraphrased Will Rogers: I never watched a Doctor I didn't like.","Very Good ""New"" Who!",1371081600,"06 13, 2013",5,1

"This has become one of my favorite TV shows since they have taken the zombie genre and crashed past its limits in a truly explosive fashion. This started as a survival horror show, in which the people were pretty much trying to stay alive while avoiding the walkers, but it has morphed into so much more. In this season, the zombies are still there, but they have pretty much become part of the scenery. Yes, they are still dangerous and become a problem in cases, but the much bigger threat comes from other humans. We have the old issues rising up in this new world, where greed, self interest and the us vs. them mentality rules the day.One of the aspects of this series I enjoy the most is the growth of the characters, especially Rich, who by virtue of being the leader of his group has to not only think about his immediate family, but also his extended one. This leads him to make many decisions that go against what he used to believe in when he was a cop in his previous life, and the effects are sometimes dramatic. As has been the case previously, the creators of the series have no qualms in killing off important characters, so you'd be best served to not get too attached to any of them in particular. I thoroughly enjoy this level of uncertainty when watching a series.Having been reading the graphic novel too, I really like how they have changed the story in the TV series. This has pretty much given me two zombie stories instead of one repeated across two different mediums. Some of the basic elements of the plot are similar, but the characters, who dies and who lives, and how certain key stories develop are all different. If you have not checked out the graphic novel do yourself a favor and try it out too.I am looking forward to the 4th season of this series, it cannot come fast enough!",Keeps getting better,1374537600,"07 23, 2013",5,1

"""The Burning Plain"" simmers slowly, transcending time and space, weaving back and forth chronologically to tell a tale of such pain and grief that it is truly heartbreaking to watch. The incredibly talented Charlize Theron plays Sylvia, a restaurant hostess somewhere in Oregon, who walks dazedly through life, exorcising her inner demons through casual, indiscriminate sex. There's a strange guy (Jose Maria Yazpik) who seems to be stalking her. Then in another strand, there's a discontented housewife (Kim Basinger) who is having an affair with a married man (Joaquim de Almeida). A tragedy ensues, lives are thrown off balance and viewers are left to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I love this method of storytelling (from the same guy who gave us Babel and Amores Perros) and putting things together step by step, though I did manage to 'solve' the dark mystery harbored by Charlize Theron early on in the story. The talented cast, including young actors J.D. Pardo and Jennifer Lawrence who play teenage lovers brought together as a result of the tragedy, deliver finely nuanced performances that elicit viewer's empathy. Nothing is black and white   what initially appear to be flawed and immoral characters are revealed to have surprising depth. This is a movie that slowly engages the viewer's attention and once it does, it takes full grip and never lets go till the final scene.",Diverse strands weave together to tell a compelling story of pain and healing,1266451200,"02 18, 2010",4,1

"If you are an avid fan of Hollywood, perhaps, you should move on.  This film is from Acorn Media.  Therefore, it is a cljazzic British TV detective series, which means there's lots of blood and gore and twisting plots.  Also, being British, these features are as much about the crime as they are about the detectives themselves.  This means that there's lots of drinking, politically incorrect sexual relations, and questionable police tactics.  These typically British coppers are very human    and very flawed characters.

"I remember her when she was a blond Hollywood starlet.  And at age 74, she decides to go into directing, and what a powerful first film!  It's one of those movies that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with so much happening in a small Missouri town one summer and a crazy woman dropped into the midst of it.  Tatum O'Neal is astounding as the mentally ill Grace who's brought home from a mental asylum after 17 years by her loyal brother Landy to live with his family because he doesn't believe she should be locked up.  But within a very short time, with the best of intentions, she wreaks havoc on his family and the town.  The wild fox Landy tries to protect who lives behind his bakery provides a nifty metaphor for Grace's life. You can't help but feel tremendous sympathy and sadness for Grace despite all she's done.Back in the 50s, there were no effective treatments for mental illness except incarceration.  I remember as a child visiting my uncle, who was a carpenter at a mental asylum, and seeing and hearing the inmates yelling and screaming from behind bars as we drove up.  It was brutal, but that's what happened to you if you couldn't handle life.

"On the upside, the season went from criminal Wesen of the week to an ongoing stories which played out during the year.  The relationships were more closely involved in addition to the criminal Wesen on this sci fi police procedural. For me, they increased the enjoyment of this season, in many ways over the previous seasons, which I also loved.  Only now in Season 3 did Nick ask how the Wesen were able to see him as a Grimm.  The cliffhanger was exceptionally enjoyable and makes waiting for the fall even more frustrating..On the down side, I didn't get as much Monroe as I wanted given his comedic skills , but the last several episodes tried to ease my pain.  At the rate things are going, everyone in Portland will know Nick's a Grimm.

"There are not many movies episodes out there that make me almost lose all interest in watching till the end, but with these opening episodes I quite literally almost fell asleep. I see a few mistakes from season 1 about to repeat themselves again.I feel like the producer and director, are paying a lot of attention to the wrong part of the series as a whole. I.E. the whole ""boy meets girl"" thing seems a little two ""Twilight"" to me,.. IMO, enough with this crap already, its a alien invasion,Global you know, everyone is about to die, of be enslaved,etc...or at least as far I can tell, yet there are more scenes of people making out,hanging out, hitting on each other, etc... instead of the tactical stuff, survival, organisation, plans,etc....#2 IMO the acting in season 1 was slowly improving, but I sure as hell hope that it will this season. I was not impressed at all, judging by these opening episodes. It  moved from lame to descent, no real emotion, or dedication from the actors, or at least that's the feeling I got. The new alien guy was the best really, lol.#3 I really hate the music soundtrack during the whole time, on some parts its just doesn't fit the scene, or at the very least they could have found a better selection,..just IMO, just brews up the scene for me.#4 Minor complaint, I really wish the whole ""war"" or ""combat scenes"" were more realistic everything from firing the weapons(recoil) to how come none really ever reloads?? come on, the girl fired that M 16 two hundred times, without reloading 1 time, or like I said in the past season RPG's do not track their targets.Really it seems to me like the director producers are trying to get this show to be success (cant blame them) but they are trying to do it by satisfying every group of the audience, i.e. something for the kids, something for all the doctors, a little for the soldier guys,etc... Unfortunately as with any other show, what this does in the end, is produce a show that does not offer a great show for ANY of these groups.Since this is a ""alien invasion"", as in ""hostile aliens"" trying to kill us all enslave us,etc... wouldn't we be more concerned about kicking their butts all the time, trying to survive, thinking about new plans,strategies, long term, finding out about the second aliens that just landed?? hello? being more conservative about out ammo,....?? The producers need to make up their minds and figure out if this is oriented towards adults, kids, librarians, nuns or what, cause if you try to please everyone you'll end up with nonsense.In the end I personally would like to see:#1 Enough with the touchy feely boy meets girl Twilight saga crap, needs less of that, more of survival, organization, what they are planning to do long term,etc...#2 The firefights,weapon recoil,damage,etc.. you get the point, needs to be a little more realistic,even some of the sounds the weapons make are not right realistic#3 IMO the music throughout the episodes needs to be perfected, the current music is not really cued if you know what I mean, I dont get different emotions for different scenes instead its just annoys me, I just wait for it to be over so I can hear people talk.#4 The acting need to be way better from everyone, especially the ""generals"" or whatever they are  the old people in the war room, they suck donkey ***s. The actors need to be more ""into"" their role, think Al Pacino in godfather..Also FYI the new show ""Defiance"" owns this show,..IMO",Hope it gets better....,1370908800,"06 11, 2013",4,1

"Another series by Josh Whedon starring a gorgeous young actress; Eliza Dushku had already starred in Buffy as Faith and as such had been a memorable addition to a great series. Here, she stars as the lead character Echo, in a series about the Dollhouse, an organisation that provides programmable companions for thr very rich. You cannot really compare this to Buffy, because due to very different jazzignments in the beginnings, the series lacks in focus and one does not really get a grip on it initially.After approximatively 6 episodes, suddenly the series starts to focus and becomes very strong.While Whedon is in many ways the &egrave;ber geek who loves to cast stunning women in his fantasy tales, one feels that he must have felt frustrated by the Buffy genre and that he has tried here to deal in a more mature  and disturbingsubject; while this is very commendable, he does initially fail, mainly because there is no clear story in the beginning. This was also the case with Buffy where in the first episode she moved to Sunnyvale and we were dropped right into the action; however in the case of the Dollhouse some kind of introduction would be needed.Also the mix of very serious actors such as Dushku and more geeky caharcters such as Topher does at times distract completely. But this is only during the first and second disc. Afterwards the storyline becomes more clear and the episodes more strucctured.Overall it is a very good series and can only be recommended",slo start,1250812800,"08 21, 2009",4,1
This show has a strong lead woman with well developed characters around her. ABC made the mistake of canceling this show before letting the people get invested in the story.

He also is a wonderful caring man outside of it.  He wants the best and expects it at all times!  We love when he hits his head on the kitchen table.

"In this ongoing saga of Ragnar Lothbrok, Earl of Kattegat, the visionary Viking vanquishes vile villains and manages meaningful meetings with monarchs.***No real spoilers in this review***The series is never short on bloody combat or steamy moments. Since it originally appears on History Channel  thankfully an actual historical drama befitting the channel's purpose  it can get away with a little more than broadcast television can. It is produced by the same people who did The Tudors for Showtime, so it carries a similar feel, albeit different period. Underlying in both series is a condemnation of Catholicism, at least as I glean, although much less so in Vikings.Season 2 takes on a stronger political feeling within the earldom. The society is wrongly depicted as autocratic when it was primarily democratic, however, other aspects of the series ring true to historical fact. The character Siggy is significantly duplicitous. King Horik is increasingly hard to read as his own agenda is at play and might be in line with Ragnar's and might not. Athelston is ever Ragnar's confidant and true friend, while Rollo is, well he is who he is and who we always want him to be.The actors are brilliant and amazingly adaptable to the difficult climate of Ireland, where the series is filmed. Maybe Vikings isn't your cup of mead, but if it is, you'll lap it up in the great hall with the rest of us wishing to enter Valhalla.",Vikings Will Raid Your Imagination,1398038400,"04 21, 2014",5,1

"I have watched all the Seasons of The Glade and think that the Series is fantastic. One gets to know the characters and therefore empathize with them.  I liked the fact that the show had mystery and was fast paced but did not need coarse language, violence or inappropriate sex to keep one interested and looking forward to the next episode.  The main characters were moral and exhibited self control.  The character of Detective jim Longworth is strong, with an ability to think outside the box, thereby invariably identifying the killer.  His sense of humor keeps adds a valuable dimension to each story.

"Monk's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons. Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders, with the help of his devoted Assistant, Natalie. Throughout this season, Monk must deal with his crazed fan, help a rapper, teaches Julie Teeger about love, hang out with his psychiatrist's son, shoots Santa Claus, joins a cult, becomes a fugitive, and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.

"THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD does what I hope a movie will, for 90 minutes or more taking me places I never knew and am not likely to ever know. Colin Hanks anchors THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD in a low key performance as Troy Gable, a law school dropout who takes work as road manager for mentalist Buck Howard(played to a tee by John Malkovich), who has gone from over sixty TONIGHT SHOW appearances to half empty Akron, Ohio, theater performances. One could argue Troy Gable's quiet demeanor reflects a state of shock, as he realizes he does not desire the law career that could be his and finds himself trying to please a temperamental, egotistical performer whose celebrity status is to show business what the V.H.S. format is to viewing movies at home. While Troy has yet to figure out what he wants from life, Buck Howard wants to get back on top, his goal a return to THE TONIGHT SHOW after decades of no invitations.I don't want to give away too much of THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD, just as Buck does not want to give away his tricks, most significant the climax of the nightly act where he determines where the audience hides the money he is to make for his performance, a fee Buck vows to sacrifice if he fails to find it. Troy Gable's search for what he has yet to identify parallels Buck Howard's attempt to return to stardom, the young man wandering, the older man on a mission. The film ends with one of the most memorable moments of eye contact between a movie's co stars I've seen.  THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD leaves it to the viewer to decide when one's time pjazzes and when one decides to simply take a pjazz.See THE GREAT BUCK HOWARD.",Finding what you're looking for without seeing it,1277683200,"06 28, 2010",4,1

"It's been years since Veronica was in Neptune but her departure from New York as a recent law school graduate and promising law firm prospect was masterfully done.  Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past.  The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon.  One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network (i,e. Star Trek: Enterprise).  Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series didn't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks.

"I must say I am pleasantly suprised that this film was not the all out gore driven blood bath that we might have expected from Takashi Miike. Instead we are treated to a sumptuously crafted movie made in the tradition of the cljazzic Japanese samurai films. Homage and honor has been meticulously given by Miike in a very respectful way. The first half of this film is beautifully shot, acted and executed. It's textures and wonderful, and the production values are top notch. Yes once the hour long battle begins it never goes in the direction of something like Kill Bill or Shogun Assjazzin with spraying blood, gore and body parts. Instead there is a lot of very harsh violence that feels authentic, while actual blood is sparse. There are a couple of rolling heads here and there, but it's not the brutal, bloody gruesome violence that we have seen in films like Ichi the Killer. In fact for Takashi Miike this is pretty tame for certain. And to his credit Miike left out the gore and fountains of blood Lady Snowblood would have left in her path for something much more believable. I loved this film, and it's a very good example of how good Takashi Miike can be a solid cljazzic movie making.

Now in his fifties he lends his vast experience in acting and character development to make his character very interesting and intriguing. His character , who is now more dangerous and such than he was a young man is a senior citizen that  really demands attention and respect. James spader himself was once a pretty boy actor who had the talent to be far more than his looks and he often proved it.  These days his a veteran older actor whose presence adds cljazz to a show. The show is about a international criminal who is using the fbi to get rid of some real scum. He's not a good man but he's better than the filth he's getting rid of.

"I've watched this show since it began when I was a fourth grader and it's weird to watch the boys have only grown one grade while I'm now four years out of high school. Season 13 of the show manages to continue the series longer than most animated shows still without killing what the show itself is meant to be, for the most part. This season if not all out great like I feel seasons 6,8 or 11 were is at least another solid season with stand out episodes. While the show did take a few more unscheduled trips to the silly end of things they still manage to be enjoyable for true fans and it hardly feels the show is selling out or risking becoming a satire of itself. Episodes this season are:The Ring   When the Jonas brothers make Kenny's new girlfriend hot he starts wearing a promise ring like them only to become boring and a shell of his former self. [I'm in favor of anything that mocks the Jonas Brothers. I hate them so much]The Coon   During times of great Woe and Despair, ""The Coon"" rises up from the gutter to defend the city. Cartmen is the city's sole savior until Mysterion arrives on the scene and he must team with Professor Chaos to unmask the new hero. [This was an entertaining stab at more recent super hero movies Dark Knight and Watchmen. If nothing else we get to see Professor Chaos again and the scenes with the stupid cops are great. I'm also surprised how few people were upset by the subtle allusion to Obama in this episode and it's controversial title]Margaritaville   While the town fights over who to blame for the poor economy, Randy steps forward with a plan to live without an economy at all. Soon the town returns to biblical times and only a Jew willing to pay for our sins can save us. Meanwhile in trying to return his father's unneeded margarita maker, Stan symbolically explores the actual problem with the economy. [A great episode with a cljazzic South Park premise, Emmy Winner]Eat, Pray, Queef   An April Fool's Day joke gone wrong finds America's women and two Canadian women much like Terrence and Phillip standing up for their right to 'fart' like men do, despite how truly disgusting the men find it. [Definitely not one of the best episodes but definitely a fun joke at the root of it and it perfectly reflects part of the male mind. Would have been better with less Terrence and Phillip, though it was nice to see them again and the recurring references to Matt & Trey's April Fool's Day joke gone wrong in '98 are always ammusing self relevance]Fishsticks   When Jimmy comes up with a great new joke about fishsticks Cartmen tries to take credit and then so does comedian Carlos Mencia. Meanwhile Kanye West doesn't get the joke and winds up becoming the joke himself. [A great episode considering it's centered on such a simple joke and manages to attack so many people so well. Do you like fishsticks? Then you must be a gay fish.]Pinewood Derby   When Randy lies to help Stan win the Pinewood Derby it results in him teaching his son how to cover up a lie only for things to obviously escalate to ridiculous levels. [A fun episode that takes a good shot at recent politics and the absurd lengths people will go to try and cover up something that's already obvious to the rest of us.]Fatbeard   Cartmen decides to become a pirate and drags Butters and a rag tag crew along only to wind up being unknowingly kidnapped by real Somalian Pirates. While Cartmen lives the life of a fairy tale pirate, the US tries to get them out of the hostage situation.[Finally another episode hitting directly on what was happening in the news that week. Very funny visuals and it wonderfully comments on the events. If not a truly great episode, it's good.]Dead Celebrities   When Ike is being haunted by the presence of dead celebrities the boys call in the ghost hunters only to realize they only scare themselves by bumping into things in the dark. Soon the boys learn the numerous recent dead celebrities wont't move on because one refuses to accept his death and possesses Ike, leading to a hilarious scene that mocks the perversion of toddler beauty pagents. [This episode made me think there could be a new era of South Park episodes. Amazing in it's execution, mocking several things well and again based right on the headlines with deeper meanings to be found in the humor. Genius.]Butter's Bottom Bitch   Butters first kiss from a girl finds him realizing why boys would pay for kisses. When he tries to start a kissing ring it escalates, unbeknownst to him, to a prostitution ring. Soon a dedicated cop is trying to take down Butters who has transformed into a P.I.M.P. [A funny topic I'm surprised they haven't commented on more before. Player's Ball scenes were great and an enjoyable episode with lots of laughs]W.T.F.   After going to a wrestling event the boys all want to become wrestlers. When they learn what real wrestling is on the school team they opt out to form their own wrestling arena where their over the top acting is so good Vince MCMahon stops by to possibly recruit them. [Amazing in how it completely properly comments on what Wrestling has become and ties in the ""Took our job"" guys taking there bit to a new extreme and gives us the new hilarious character of the school wrestling teacher who everyone thinks is gay. A personal favorite.]Whale Whores   When Stan's birthday trip to the Aquarium is ruined by Japanese Dolphin killer's he sets out to stop them and make a difference in the world. He crosses paths with several Discovery Channel reality shows before realizing they don't actually do anything. In the end we see why the Japanese hate Dolphins and Whales so much. [Excellent beginning in how it mocks several things. It looses some steam but the final joke is amusing and the episode as a whole is fun. Especially the turnaround on the Japanese being thought cruel for slaughtering dolphins and whales but America will accept them slaughtering cows because that's normal]The F Word   When the boys use the f word (ends in an ag) to describe some attention seeking Harley rider's everyone gets upset. The Harley rider's explore the origin of the word while the boys fight to explain their meaning of the word versus the meaning the adults have. [Some didn't like this episode. I have argued the point it makes for years. The definition of words is always changing and I agree that the F word now means the definition given at the end of this episode, or at least loud annoying people who crave attention]Dances With Smurfs   When Cartmen takes over the announcements at school he becomes like many recent supposed journalists who just use free speech as an excuse to package their opinion as fact. Soon he is targeting cljazz president Wendy and accusing her of elaborately made up lies.[A fun episode that takes good shots at Avatar, the recent so called journalists and the very recent headlines of a politician who actually claimed to have run off to the mountains]Pee   When the boys go to a water park Kyle is bothered by the discovery that everyone, including Stan, pees in the pools. Cartmen is disillusioned by the abundance of minorities. Then when the pool PH levels are nearly all P and no H disaster strikes leaving Kyle to face his fear of urine and Cartmen believing he is the last white man alive. [If not a great season finale it does mock the stupidity of 2012, has a good running bit for Kyle and has the hilarious story of Cartmen believing he has become the world's last majority surrounded by minorities and singing an awesome song about it while making a true statement about America]This season set (Available in 3 disc DVD or 2 disc Blu Ray) contains the same mini commentaries included on each season set since the third season. Nowadays Matt and Trey have caught up with themselves and are commenting on episodes right after (and in some cases before) they've finished making them. I personally found this set's mini com's to be very entertaining and funny. This is also the first season to contain deleted scenes, which unlike most shows, are actually entertaining stuff that just had to be cut for time. Another interesting special feaure for true South Park fans is an XBOX Live segment giving fans a look inside South Park studios.Also included is some sort of X Box cross promotion for a game called, South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play! XLBA, that will give purchasers of this DVD or Blu Ray a free character and two unlockable levels, whatever that means.All in all I continue to commend South Park for avoiding satirizing itself like other favorites the Simpsons, or even Family Guy. This show is always just about pointing out how stupid things are and as long as they never take that too serial then they will always have good episodes if not great ones. It's hard to expect them to come up with constant simplistically genius episode concepts like Guitar Queer o, Make Love Not Warcraft, Good Times With Weapons or Imaginationland on a nonstop basis. So a mere good season is forgiven as long as it contains great episodes which this one does. Five Stars for being as Funny and certainly as Entertaining as Ever.*After having now rewatched the episodes, this season stands up much better in second viewing. I would now say it's much better than just good, though still not truly great.",Goin' On Down to South Park for the Thirteenth Time,1261094400,"12 18, 2009",5,1

"I liked this show. The story was good, well balanced. The characters were believable, at least on the hero's side, and the balance between the future scenes and present day was really good.My quibbles were with some plot holes, not least of which was the handwavium in places. Our hero has no idea at all where her enemies are. She has to hunt them down, but for some reason her enemies seem to know where she is at all times. They can even find her on city streets. And as for the idea that a computer genius from sixty some years in the past being able to not just interact with future tech but repair it   no.

"This show is well acted, well thought out, and interesting.Our hero is an emergency room doctor who was fired after a bum rap where he had two heart patients under treatment, and one (a rich patron of the hospital) died while he attended the second.In an attempt to cheer him up, his brother takes him to the Hamptons for a party weekend. Accidental patients pop up despite his resistance to become involved as a 'private physician to the rich', and finally he gives in and agrees to stay in the area. He winds up agreeing partly because his other job opportunities appear to be blocked off for the time being, and because a local hospital administrator convinces him that he can help take some of the pressure from the local hospital staff, who are often beset by minor problems from rich and demanding people.The show is amusing, sexy, and seemingly well informed. I don't know what the market really is for private physicians, but whether or not it exists, Royal Pains sold the possible concept acceptably.In an early version of this review, I wrote that the success of the show in the long term would depend on their ability to come up with a couple of medical problems per show that aren't repetitive or trite, or making the Doc look like too much of an unbelievable miracle worker at a house call. It's a more challenging writing puzzle than a hospital based medical show, or the standard murder mystery fair that USA has also been quite successful with. I'll have to say that two years (plus) later, I can report that they were right on top of my concern, and the writers have kept the show fresh both with their continuing plots, and with interesting medical conditions that don't too often stray into either ""MacGyver"" or ""House"" territory.The character of the brother, Evan, has particularly shown well thought out and satisfying character development. At the start of the show, Evan was simply an the irritation which spurred Hank (the doctor) to start this type of practice, and provided comic relief with his wild plans for promotions. They've allowed Evan to grow into a more thoughtful and capable man, while at the same time retaining his funny side.The writers have also taken some surprising turns with continuing relationships and plots. Early on, Evan and Divya (their nurse practitioner) seemed like the perfect long term antithetical romance. While they played with that concept a bit, they never really let it bloom, eventually moving Evan into a long term and mostly very mature relationship with an heiress. Divya's character moved into and out of the prospect of consummating a marriage arranged in her childhood, and they've now given her a separate antithetical romance with a doctor on staff at the small local hospital.The addition of Henry Winkler to the cast as the brothers' long lost father was a savvy move. He adds a lot to the episodes he's in.This review has covered more material than just the first season, but that's OK. The show has been very even in quality throughout. If you like the first season, you won't regret moving on the the rest.Highly recommended.",Another solid show from USA,1317427200,"10 1, 2011",5,1

"In recent years involvement within the Sea Org has become a focal point within Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard's ideas and ideals came under scrutiny by his own contemporaries. The psychology of indoctrination is a know and has been recognized by historians professionals in the twentieth century and documented from before the Christian Era. This presentation recognizes and perhaps tries to dispel misinformation while giving the opportunity for more personal accounts of Scientology's practices. If you have read Hubbard's books or know of the principles of Scientology, there is no further information that is included. Dianetics is based on freeing one from trauma in 'past lives' . . . one must remember that Hubbard was a writer of 'pulp fiction' science fiction. His 'E meter' certainly falls in line with his books! The Church of Scientology has fallen afoul of multiple global government organizations. The Australian government is featured as such in this video.  What questions need to be answered, the involvement of 'high profile' members, recruitment of members, monies paid to the 'church,' and family relations are all addressed.The interviews and included documentation flow smoothly and are easily followed.

"                                      ""Troll Hunter""                                      This Norwegian film is a fun combination of horror film and faux documentary, exploring a world where trolls are real and are (secretly) managed by the Norwegian government as a nature conservation issue, much like flooding, wild wolves or avalanches.  The troll issue is kept from the public though, and it is only by chance that a young student film crew stumbles on the one man who is charged with keeping trolls on the reservation. The troll hunter named Hans is played by actor Otto Jespersen, with a cool, calm reserve that helps hold viewers attention.  Hans seems to have an agenda, but it's never quite clear what it is.  After combating (and occasionally mjazzacring) the trolls, he breaks the government's silence, and lets the hapless college kids follow him and film what happens.The filmmakers balance elements of comedy and horror, and skillfully underplay their hand   they know audiences have already seen similar films (Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.) so they don't rely to much on the ""documentary"" gag. Similarly, they judiciously withhold the special effects so that they don't get old. They also don't make them too groovy    the trolls look both amazingly and comedically weird, just weird enough that you think, ""they look just like illustrations from an old fairy tale   what if ""real"" trolls really looked like cartoon figures?""  They also inject just enough tragedy and tension tht the film doesn't feel like a joke.  If the premise sounds good, you'll probably enjoy the movie and it's slowly unfolding narrative and inconclusive ending. Also, the filmmakers seem to have positioned themselves for both a prequel and sequels... I wouldn't be surprised to see a comic book come out of this as well.

"Michael Westen, with his distinctive droll humor and mellow charm is an endlessly fun character.  His way of being placidly befuddled by all things female is a great counter to his spy smarts.  Donovan fits the role so perfectly it is as though the series was written for him.The plots are light and fast blends of stuff   CIA operative spy stuff, Miami lowlife stuff, romantic stuff, family stuff, and other stuff.  Fi is perfectly Fi   her pretty, petite, and generally nearly naked self, loving to blow things up and so very eager to shoot anything that moves.  Michael takes Fi home to have dinner with mom, and Fi turns into the sweet and innocent ""girl next door""   laugh out loud funny.  The somewhat slovenly and slightly alcoholic Sam, a womanizer (but not in the typical misogynistic way) adds just the right presence.  Madeline round out the fine core quartet.Only one thing marred my otherwise unqualified enthusiasm for Burn Notice. Mom Madeline's chain smoking.  Watching someone smoke is about the same as watching someone barf   flat out nauseating. And it generates two obvious flaws in the character    Madeline's beautiful complexion and her sparkling white teeth    no chain smoker has either of those.  Not that the series is meant to be realistic   no appeal in that!  But if Madeline were scripted with an interesting addiction or predilection, rather than this dull and repulsive one, the role could have been enhanced.  So many opportunities lost!As one of the other reviewers noted, Michael is eminently quotable: ""Duct tape makes you smart.""  Ahhh ......

"There is so much to love about 30 ROCK but incredibly the best part is the funniest comedic actor working in tv today, Alec Baldwin.  There were a few hints that he might have this comedic ability: his stints guesting on SNL as host and his semi comedic turn as the dim witted con in MIAMI BLUES. Nevertheless, one is hard pressed to reconcile his comedic portrayal as the head of NBC with the actor who opened GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS with the historic ""closing is for closers"" soliloquy. For three seasons though I have laughed and laughed as his character has only expanded and gotten funnier.  This is especially amazing considering he is sharing screen time with some of SNL's biggest alumni.  Tina Fey does a fabulous writing job and is excellent as everyone's hard pressed straight woman Liz Lemon.  Fey plays the head writer of a tv show which is just like SNL.  She stands between her staff of writers and comedians and the head of programming, Jack, played by Baldwin.  Her writers and comedians are to a person barely sane on a daily basis. The other three supporting characters are Tracy and Jenna as competing comedic costars on Lemon's show and Kenneth, a page at NBC, who as a hick from the sticks is a foil for everyone else's urbanity.  I think Tracy and Jenna were originally intended to be bigger than Jack Baldwin on the show but Baldwin had little trouble upstaging them in short order.  All three spin around him and Liz Lemon and as supporting characters they are excellent.  I've seen all three seasons .

"""The Tudors"" is unlike any television show ever broadcast. The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget, the acting is worthy of Oscars, and the story, although told before, is presented here fresh and is excitingly original. This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him. The first season details the King's attempts to divorce his wife, Katherine of Aragon, and his lust for Anne Boleyn. The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes, but what makes ""The Tudors"" work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads, most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator, but a man who loves his country and his people. The series won many Emmy nominations, most notably one for Meyers, for his soaring portrayal. ""The Tudors"" is beautifully produced, with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series. In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD (season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010).","'An Epic Saga""",1258934400,"11 23, 2009",5,1

"Very solid film. Good acting, just enough suspense and twists that kept the movie interestingly fresh. I found it to be a cross between Wallstreet and a drama somewhat similar to Unfaithful, (with Gere as well) but without the explicit material. It took quite a few scenes to realize where the movie was going, but once a certain incident happened, it really pulled me. Not a whole lot of action which I'm fine with. I just thought I'd throw that out there for those hoping to see a 20 minute car chase with loud machine guns popping off every second. I have to note that Tim Roth is amazing as the head strong detective. If you like movies where very wealthy and powerful men have they're lives turned upside down and then try to wash they're hands of it, I think you'll enjoy this too. I wish Hollywood would make more throwback style movies like this and get them into theaters. I'm sick of sequels and CGI.",I enjoyed this.,1379894400,"09 23, 2013",4,1
"Bates Motel is one of the best new shows of the 2012 2013 season. I saw it online a few weeks ago and I finished the complete season in three days; I was totally hooked. The pilot kicks off strongly and as the show goes on, it keeps having the mystery, the drama, the feeling of never knowing what will happen next... I just love it!I was feeling a little skeptical with the cast, but as soon as I saw the series, I knew Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore were perfect for their parts. Any person who loves mystery shows with a little bit of drama (even teen dramas), will love it.It's not just a show about murders and blood, but it makes you get into the head of the characters, and the decisions they make. I hope this show lasts a long time, because it has so many potential to last many years. I can't wait to get this set! I'm hoping it has a lot of bonus features. The only thing that sucks is that we have to wait a long time for the second season, but now I know it will be worth it!If you haven't watched the show, do it now!

"More like 3.5 stars and here's why:1) I gave it four because I am a fan and am continuing to watch the show. I enjoy the characters, acting, and overall concept.  And, surprisingly, I really like the Louis Litt character.2) I was tempted to give it three stars because the story is very formulatic from show to show:  Case comes. Seems impossible to win. Harvey & Mike figure out something cool to win.  Yay!  Throw in occasional character development... So yeah, that's one reason why I'm not head over heels, but also keep in mind that I'm binge watching these shows, so the formula may seem more apparent from that perspective, too","3.5 stars, really",1395187200,"03 19, 2014",4,1

"Only insignificant spoilers aheadGreat, adult oriented, show. Compelling characters, good acting and great reconstruction of Viking culture. Less bloody than you might expect, though nobody will ever accuse this of being a family oriented show. The show is based (loosely) on the ancient viking tales of Ragnar Lothbrok, a Viking who may or may not have done all of the things he is given credit for in the writings of the monks and scribes who penned the tales. I warn you to not read too deeply into those tales before you see the series, as it will give you some unwanted (in my case) insights into where major plot lines of the story will go, and the fates of some of the major characters.I was especially pleased with the way in which Ragnar's character is played. He's not a particularly nice fellow   he becomes famous for killing a lot of, often, defenseless people and stealing their stuff. On the other hand, his home life is shown in a mostly favorable light   good father and provider and such stuff. How can you really be a hero to a modern audience when you slaughter entire monasteries and then get a captive monk drunk and develop a sense of trust with him so that he tells you the locations of other targets to hit? Fortunately the writers don't try to clean up his life story, or life style and shows Ragnar and his people as the savage killers they are. Killers with a, sometimes flexible, code of honor, but still killers.Interestingly enough I have figured that this version is a 'cleaned up' edit of what has been shown elsewhere. Having read about the series on some other websites before deciding to watch it, I saw screen shots that did not appear in this version. Evidently it is ok to show axes splitting skulls, but we have to protect little Timmy from any potentially offensive sexual content.In any event, the series was great and my wife and I binge watched through the first season in a weekend. We are very much looking forward to seeing the second season once it becomes available.",Great new series based (loosely) on an ancient viking (anti?)hero,1389225600,"01 9, 2014",5,1

"I'm a fan of the Michael Mann ""Manhunter"" and I really enjoyed the casting changes for the Dr. Bloom and Freddie Lounds characters; I think the latter is based on E Jean Carroll circa 1983.  This is a very well shot show   better than Twin Peaks though there are some similarities.  This show is awash in urban grey blues sort of metallic.Mads Mikkelson is awesome to watch.  I really hate him now.  He's really making Hannibal Lecter look very mean, silently petty and sadistic.The bodies in every episode are very shocking and disgusting.  There have been two episodes that were ugly and boring.  There haven't been any scenes that have made me keep an episode on my dvr until the latest one when we are SHOWN more of Hannibal's seething beneath the surface   it's Gillian Anderson's first appearance and she's always a disturbing casting choice to me so it feels right that she is cast in this disturbing show.I surprisingly don't mind Hugh Dancy in the this role    he has this flat, phd voice that he must enjoy using since he is English.  I think Mads Mikkelson is using his own accent.The set design on this show is sophisticated and a relief from the usual stock images   think Grimm and how every Portland interior looks feels the same and probably used the same can of paint.Mads Mikkelson's scenes create a handbook of caution   they should be stitched together into one movie.  It is so dangerous to be on his radar.

"I wasn't a big fan of &#34;Silence of the Lambs&#34;.  Yes, it's a good movie, and I love Jodie Foster in it, but it's not a movie I could watch over and over again.  That said, I am a huge fan of &#34;Manhunter&#34;  the first movie about Hannibal.  I have watched Manhunter over and over again, and every time I watch an episode of this Hannibal series, I want to watch Manhunter again, because there is such a profound connection between that story and this prequel to it.  I fell in love with Will Graham as portrayed by William Petersen (now famous for his role in C.S.I. Vegas).  Since watching this Hannibal TV series, I understand that Will Graham so much better, and I feel the terror of the moment he faced Hannibal again, years after catching him.It took me a while to adjust to the new face and voice of Hannibal, but now, I wouldn't have it any other way    Mads Mikkelsen is incredible!  But more than that    this Will Graham is perfection.  The entire cast is perfection, really.  Even the fact that Freddie is a woman in this series, and Jack is black, it doesn't matter    as a fan of Manhunter, I still relate, and I love this retelling of a story that has chilled me to the core since the first time I saw that version of these characters.The only criticism I have for this series is the over the top serial killers that fill some episodes, the frequency of serial killers in one area, and how quickly and easily they are caught...however, I can and do forgive the writers that leap of faith, because it is so worthwhile to watch Will Graham at work!!!The entire reason I had for watching C.S.I. to begin with was Will Graham    William Petersen was a familiar face.  I had missed him.  He was back!  And I became hooked because of his excellent portrayal of a most fascinating detective.  And now, I am hooked on this series and can't wait for its return!

"RESURRECT DEAD (a k a RESURRECT DEAD: THE MYSTERY OF THE TOYNBEE TILES, 2011, 86 minutes) is a documentary about a middle aged artist on a quest. The famous ""Toynbee Tiles"" are rather obnoxious street tiles set into the middle of streets in cities across the U.S. and South America. Bearing a schizophrenic message about the hidden meaning behind Stanley Kubrick's2001   A Space Odyssey, these tiles were apparently placed starting in the early 1980s by one very crazy man.This not only documents the phenomenon very well, in a way that held my interest, but also served the filmmaker as a bit of a catharsis I think. The fellow is a bit of an obsessed artist   as I am   and has trouble letting go of his ""mysteries"". He finds a mystery and becomes determined to solve it. He seems to have solved the mystery of these street tiles: the obsessive, mentally disturbed work of another individual by the name of Severiano Verna.This is really a rather fun and absorbing thing   it was for me on a very boring morning, anyway. The problem was it reminded me too much of the PHILDELPHIA EXPERIMENT by Charles Berlitz. This involved another strange nutcase similar to Verna: Carl Michael Allen, who rechristened himself Carlos Miguel Allende. Allende really started the silly flap about the Philadelphia Experiment with his schizophrenic ravings; as he was in the Navy as a teen, he became obsessed with the story about the vanishing battleship experiment from the 1940s.Allen, too, hid himself from the world after pushing himself on every media outlet he could. Allen, too, produced endless writings that sounded intelligent but ultimately consisted only of weirdly gathered snippets of his lifetime of reading. At one point, it was said, Allen's work came to the eager attention of the government.Yet he turned out to be a crazy old man who had started life as a crazy young man. He lived in Mexico for the most part, hidden and isolated just as Severiano Verna is still hidden and isolated in his little home in Philadelphia. Here, to the filmmakers' credit, they decided that enough was enough and pursued Verna no more. A letter they sent him remains unanswered.What worries me about all this   and these kinds of things are of interest to me as a scientist   is the cult mentality evident here. The filmmakers had the good sense to do what everyone else apparently has done over the decades: walk away from the crazy man. It sounds heartless, but often, this type of crazy intelligent expressive person really wants no contact with anyone. Often it is too late to do anything to help their mental health.I suggest this excellent film as a learning experience for everyone.

I have followed the concepts in this film for a while now on my own and have come to pretty much the same conclusions. I don't know if they had the harder science and were dumbing it down or are just fanatics. The presentation was hollow and pretentious. Their heart seemed to be in the right place but they relied too much on standard production tricks rather than presenting a solid straight forward case. The science and documentation is out there they just need to work harder to find and use it.That is not to say I didn't enjoy the documentary and would recommend it to anyone curious on the topic.

This andDreamlandfit between what Amazon calls seasons 4 and 5.These are absolutely beautiful to watch (in HD) and David Tennant is wonderful in all these episodes.  Planet of the Dead is a great stand alone story.

"The Riches is the most recent TV show I've been watching, and I have one question. How in the world could they cancel it!? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me. It's also got to be one of the most creative shows I've ever seen! The show centers around the Molloy family, a family of modern day gypsies. Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail, after serving a two year sentence. A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family, but things aren't what they seem. The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp. Wayne (Eddie Izzard) is not going empty handed though. Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money. Once on the road, they run into another family from camp, that had been oblivious to what was going on. It doesn't take them long to realize something isn't right, but before they can confront them, the Molloy's take off and a big highway RV chase begins. During the chase a pjazzing motorist and his wife are killed. The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich, and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls. Doug was a savvy lawyer, who made a fortune at the expense of others. On this day he and his new wife were on the run also, moving away from everyone and everything they've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet. Thanks to paper work in the car, Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going. It is then that he decides it's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice, normal, ""buffer"", lifestyle. Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine. Along with their 3 kids, the Molloy's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability. The show is amazing! There are so many twist and turns, cons and jokes, ups and downs, It's so well written, with an outrageous cast of characters, and most important of all, a storyline I promise you have never seen before!  The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008, but both seasons are available, and according to Wikipedia, Eddie Izzard and the show's creator are currently working on a full length feature film. If you want something different crossing comedy, drama, and action, then I'd say The Riches are for you!",The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,1362009600,"02 28, 2013",4,1

"The film lasts about 35 minutes and it had my undivided attention.  The background music was soothing and inviting   not demanding. The people who were interviewed and the moderator   portrayed a spiritual sense of needing to know more and we cannot know more until we share what we know. They shared quite a bit of information on matter, geometry, physics, astrology, and so forth.  It is very informing.I would definitely want to see more films made by Gundi G but this film, as much as they claim to encompjazz everything   fails to encompjazz or address the aspect of evil    a significant reality, which brings me to the notion that I am NOT God. I seek power that gives me the strength to go on and most certainly I have experienced the feeling that I am being carried through difficult times and I am not alone.

"I don't know what I think of Bosch yet and I think I need to care about him. I don't know if he did murder the man instead of being in fear of his life and shooting a man. His character is not clear. Being cleared by the LAPD is not necessarily actual clearance and the civil court case for money doesn't give me any information to help find out if I like this man or if I respect him. Great detectives who go out of their way to figure out a case are always wonderful to watch. But if the dead child has hooked him since the doctor told him about the twist fracture because Bosch was an abused child, that is personal and doesn't constitute tenacious detective work. I don't know if I care if he wins the court case or not and I think I should. Too many people don't like him and I have not seen if that is because he is good at what he does or is just a bad guy.","Good story, good characters but do I care?",1394236800,"03 8, 2014",4,1

"The premise was fulfilled. Take a very complex machine, newly designed and built, place several space experienced tech nauts aboard. For the first time send humans, past the moon towards Jupiter's moon Europa, only because a robot craft had detected liquid water beneath thick ice crust. More then a year out to destination, have them deal with all the physical and mental stresses. Expect them to arrive the same people they started out as, and take their unproven machines, land safely, explore safely, discover safely and firstly, send all information back safely, then, if they can, lift off safely, return to their main ship and return to Earth.., safely.  The odds of humans returning safely, under such circumstances are not high. Until many have attempted and died to 'field' test' the concepts, technology and strategies for coping with humans under alien conditions, for incredible periods of time, catastrophes will occur. Machines will fail, people will fail.The only thing in the mission that was planned well and had the highest odds of succeeding was the broadcast of knowledge back to humanity. The crew or some members were not given good odds of returning safely. Humans may be the best bio quantum computers to send out, but they are also the most fragile and vulnerable to failure.  Yes, communications did break down, but that was necessary to the plot, for it made the individuals fight harder to survive, even if they must, individually sacrifice their lives. Someone had to survive to relay the incredible news to Earth.  Of course after they all perished, communications miraculously returned and the shattering news was received. Makes ya wonder, if the aliens under the ice, interfered with the transmissions, suckered the humans down to their deaths, ate them up or whatever, then released the transmissions to entice the rest of humanity to come visit their mysterious world. Humans are suckers for solving mysteries and becoming victims.., we are sooo delicious.If one is to view this realistically, the plot was sound, the personalities were reasonable. Their purpose and decision making was reasonable, and they accomplished their mission.., which is really what human endeavors are all about. Whether you're sent to dig a ton of coal or gold 1 2 mile underground or search for diamonds on Mars, your mission is to retrieve information and results for those waiting safely above.  The crew must have hope of their safe return to encourage them to go, but they must have some doubts tucked away in the back of their minds, which only surface as one technical or human failure begins to occur after another.Even in the midst of impending doom, the 'lone survivor', clings tenaciously to the hope she will make it back.It was a decently produced and acted presentation of 'what if'.  If you really want to make a difference for humanity 'discover' something significant.  Thus, Einstein, Dawkins, Henry Ford, Darwin, Madame Curie, Pasteur, S. Jobs, Galileo, products like fire, wheels, velcro, zippers, internal combustion engines, Butter, beer, vinegar, planes, trains, cars, rockets. Discover, invent and create Something significant.., and you don't have to survive for it to make a difference for those whole are to come.

"Dear Reader, made in a documentary style, Detachment is a product of director Tony Kaye (yes, the same guy who made American History X) and Adrien Brody (in yet another role of a life time) This is not one of those films that sit on the edge and meander, this film truly takes film making to another level and back to school. The screenplay is resounding and moving. The film deals with politics  > condition of teachers, student, white america, black america, fat american teenagers with insecurities, prostitution, the women degradation trip America has adopted, the importance of reading and to end it deals with loneliness. I would say it's the most moving relevant film of last year (2011) and trust you me I've seen atleast 25 very good films from the year. Adrien Brody kills it.

"This show is definitely not my thing. I don't mind musicals, in general (as an aside: the musical episode of Scrubs was probably my favorite of that entire show), but I couldn't stand this. The characters were too cheesy for my taste  they were all very generic caricatures that lacked depth. Trite is the word I'm looking for. Additionally, the songs felt forced and were always jarring. The songs in a good musical should come naturally. These really didn't, in my opinion. I also didn't find the singing to be very good.Honestly, I had a hard time getting through the episode.

"I will start by saying I am a big Doctor Who fan, and don't buy many TV episodes of other series, but I always buy these.  And when Russell Davies stopped being part of the creative team some time ago, there was a noticeable decline in the charm whimsy of the episodes but I still enjoyed most of the Rory Amy storyline.  But the Rings of Akhaten wasn't just boring (which it was), the director really turned Matt's characterization of Dr. Who into an angst ridden simpleton for this episode.  Clara's character is still interesting and dynamic, but Dr. Who has been left two dimensional and out of character in many ways.  The story was simple, predictable and there was no real sympathy for any character other than probably some for Clara  but even then, it is only her stage presence that holds any real emotion.I didn't care much for the previous Bells episode either, but I gave it latitude in developing a new story arc without two well loved characters (Rory and Amy that is).  The same way I let go of Rose Tyler and Donna Noble and all of the Doctor's previous companions, I figured it will take a couple of episodes to integrate Clara (though she was fabulous in her earlier appearances before this current second part of Season 7).  But that does not account for the poor writing directing and over acting (I blame this on the director and not Matt) that this episode is full of.  Huge disappointment.  I only hope that they find their legs in a couple more episodes or I might decide I'm no longer a fan and stop buying them.  Honestly, I wish they'd get Russell back because his storylines with Moffett were the best (except of course the Doctor's Wife by Gaimon which was one of the best EVER!), but I'd settle for the better episodes of last season than whatever drivel this episode was.If this is your fist view of a Dr. Who episode, DON'T DO IT!  Go back to Rose Tyler to discover this wonderful series and hopefully this episode (and the previous one) is just a fluke of bad craftsmanship.

"Sometime in the near future, some people get obsessed with celebrities so much that some companies start providing these admirers with a new way to get closer to their ""stars"": getting infected with the same virus as their favorite celebrities. Young Syd March (Caleb Landry Jones) works for the Lucas Clinic, a company that owns the exclusive rights for such super celebrities as Hannah Geist (Sarah Gadon).I know this is a satire   not a very good one, but a satire nonetheless   so I decided to keep watching, ignoring the film's unbelievable premise.

"This Project Runway spinoff stresses all the bad elements of its parent, including the principal one: Angst over Art. In the original Runway, Tim Gunn mentors the designers, who often spat and denigrate each other. Here, Gunn mentors three past Runway participants, who then act as mentor to their own small group of designers. So now the designers can spat, the mentors can spat, and the clothes get moved even farther to the back of the stage. Indeed, Project Runway is all about personal validation, rather than validation of one's art, and it wouldn't be part of the Runway franchise if we didn't have tears and self pity and pretensions of hipness, which we get in spades this time around. There's an episode of disgusting bullying by people who themselves claim to have been bullied (including one of the mentors), as well as a moment involving a confession of attempted suicide that seems to be nothing but a pathetic bid for sympathy to avoid elimination. Tim Gunn, who has now become a caricature of himself, acquiesces in the bullying, not at all to his credit. Then there are the judges, a second rate trio if there ever was one, including one loud mouthed person who is nothing but smoke and mirrors. I won't divulge the ultimate winners, of course, but I will say that the show partially redeems itself by selecting correctly at the very end.

"There are a handful of directors who have created such buzz surrounding their distinct voices that there is talk about them, their films and their methods with every film, before, after and even long after he&#8217;s moved on to something else.  Lars von Trier is probably the king of this.  Since his start in the early 90&#8217;s, von Trier has graced audiences (small audiences, but audiences) with his perverse and often shocking depictions of sexuality, sexism and masochism.  Sometimes, he finds ways to shade his own ideas, philosophies, theories and musings with enough style and depth to make them feel warranted, making the shock of it all carry the weight it needs to sit on our palate.And then other times he just shows us a lot of pictures of genitals and expects us to feel something other than repulsion.Now, I&#8217;ve been a longstanding champion of von Trier and his vision.  While others have tossed many disparaging remarks his way and have taken arms against some of his more recent films, I&#8217;ve stood my ground and played devil&#8217;s advocate in his favor.  &#8216;Antichrist&#8217; was a pretty disturbing film, but when all was said and done there was an underlying purpose to von Trier&#8217;s madness, and while it didn&#8217;t all translate how he would have liked (or at least how the audience would have liked) there is no denying that von Trier had a pretty bold narrative and some pretty confident points to entertain, and the core performance from Charlotte Gainsbourg was astonishingly grounded in the context of the film (such a fearless performance, through and through).I can&#8217;t defend this.&#8216;Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 & 2&#8217; is basically a four hour film that recounts a young woman&#8217;s many, many, many sexual trysts.  Pretending to exploit (here we go again with exploitation in film) the double standard that abounds within the treatment of men and women, especially in a sexual context, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; confuses all of its own ideals in a strange hodgepodge of &#8216;chapters&#8217; that drone on and on and ultimately take us nowhere.  Opening with a beaten young woman named Joe being helped off the street by the neighborhood psychiatrist, Seligman, and then delving into the depths of carnal lusting and abuse, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is probably one of the most self absorbed and self indulgent films I&#8217;ve ever had the displeasure of seeing.I think that Lars von Trier has a deep seated interest in uncovering the depths of a woman&#8217;s psyche.  I don&#8217;t think that he is a misogynist at all.  In fact, I tend to side with Uma Thurman on this subject:&#8220;He&#8217;s a very provocative filmmaker, but he writes women with more depth and respect and complexity than most writers.  The idea that people debate whether he&#8217;s a misogynist?  People should debate whether people who don&#8217;t even write women are misogynist.  The fact is, he&#8217;s dedicated a large portion of his artistic life to the exploration of the female psyche&#8212;good and bad, light and dark, shadows, textures.  The fact that he&#8217;s dedicated a huge part of his talents to that, to me, defies the concept that he doesn&#8217;t have respect, interest, and genuine compjazzion in women.  People should question writers that don&#8217;t even give a d*** about a female character.  They are the misogynists.&#8221;Sadly, this respect and intrigue isn&#8217;t seen very well here at all.  Instead, &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels about as misogynist as they come, and at the end of the day it&#8217;s even worse than that; the film feels just plain trashy.  Lars von Trier has built a career out of shock value, but his shocking contributions to film have always felt grounded in a linier plot or at least in an idea that has sprouted into madness, but a clear idea at the core.  Most of &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; feels nonsensical and devoid of rational narrative, and while he tries to find some footing in the film&#8217;s final throws, he never establishes anything concrete within Joe&#8217;s story to hook us to her, to latch onto us and so it all winds up feeling rather misguided.There is a point here, but von Trier doesn&#8217;t know what it is.Instead, von Trier treats us to a young girl&#8217;s dissention into depravity.  She prostitutes herself for sexual pleasure at a very young age, playing games with her best friend and even forming a club that&#8217;s primary focus was to rack up sexual partners, never forming a lasting relationship with anyone (no one lay to be repeated), and Joe recounts her story with absolutely no emotion, as if none of it matters (because it doesn&#8217;t) and Seligman tries to liken her whorish behavior to numbers and fish while she relates it all to her dying father and an ash tree; and while Joe is pretending she&#8217;s falling in love with Shia LaBeouf (because that could never happen for real), volume 1 ends and volume 2 begins and this is where things get dicey.  Sexual pleasure is lost, which leads to Joe finding her own personal Fight Club and hiring translators to hook her up with Africans and before we know it, Joe has become a Soprano and is grooming a freaky eared nymph to take her place, and her man.And then Seligman takes off his pants.There is so much going on here and yet none of it ever feels necessary.  It is all just there to make your eyes hurt (they will hurt) and the film&#8217;s primary point seems to center on how Joe&#8217;s disturbing actions are all validated because men are disgusting pigs and she is living in the repressed guilt of her of desires, but it&#8217;s not that simple and yet von Trier never steps back from his own visual shockfest long enough to try and actually develop these themes.  Instead he&#8217;d rather show us a bunch of genitalia and sexual acts and then force feed us a finale that feels appropriate ONLY because the film pretty much sets us up for a cop out ending.There is such a thing as being bold and fearless, and &#8216;Nymphomaniac&#8217; is both of those things, but it is also soulless and hollow, and when you are both of THOSE things, bold and fearless will only harm you.",3 + 5 = 8?,1395964800,"03 28, 2014",2,-1

"If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film ""Grave Encounters,"" they're hoping you'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled ""Grave Encounters 2.""  Utilizing the increasingly popular ""found footage"" genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation, ""Grave Encounters"" was a reasonably effective (if not spectacularly original) entry into the horror arena.  It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go to genre of filmmaking, so it's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack.  This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story.  And it is just so tired already!  But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer, found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience.  I may not have hated ""Grave Encounters 2"" as much as some  but after a reasonably promising set up, the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic (and ill conceived) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie.  A film student (Richard Harmon) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not.  As any remarkably sane person would do, he jazzembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior.  Even if everything is real (which he believes), his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival.  There isn't much more to tell without revealing spoilers.  I'll just say that the introduction (which takes a VERY LONG time) is handled well enough, but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise.  Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second, and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film. Here, The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision.  This movie presupposes that you've seen the original.  Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone, the finale will lose some of its impact.  But maybe that's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far.  If you remember the stylistic differences between ""Blair Witch"" and its abysmal sequel, some of the same mistakes were made here.  It's almost too meta, too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own.  And with the choices made in the conclusion, it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me.

"I had high hopes for this movie based on some of the other reviews and the fact that I like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Unfortunately, there were few redeeming qualities about this movie and their acting wasn't among them.The storyline fell flat, the acting was shallow, and Richard Gere's character was a total A hole. Didn't care what happened to him at all. And it turns out that his wife, played by Susan Sarandon, was just as bad. She really didn't care what he did or how he did it as long as he didn't bring his problems ""to their doorstep"" or get their daughter in trouble (the daughter was the firm's CFO).The entire film felt like a made for TV movie, not a national theater release. Actually, it felt like a Lifetime channel made for TV movie!The only redeeming character was the young man who begrudgingly helped Gere's character. He was the only one who had a heart and deserved leniency. He and maybe Gere's daughter.The kicker for me though, was that the movie was so poorly done that they put Susan Sarandon in a cheap prom like gown to go to a charity ball. Now, keep in mind that Sarandon and Gere's characters are multi millionaires in their mid 50s. So why in the world would she be in an ill fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown?Why do I care about the dress? Because it just highlighted the fact that the writers and directors did not pay attention to small details that would have made this film more believable and more worth watching.

"This kept coming up on my ""Recommended"" page because I've been watching a lot of BBC series on Prime lately, so I thought, Oh, why not.This was a joint production between ITV and PBS, designed primarily for the American market.  This explains the heaving decolletage and lip augmentation for the ladies, and the too long hipster haircuts on the dudes, one of whom looks for all the world like Bob Dylan in his mid 60s Carnaby Street phase.  Theoretically, the movie is based on a novel by Jane Austen.  But even if you're not an ""Austen purist"", it would be hard to cljazz this movie as anything other than a guilty pleasure, though I couldn't tell you where the pleasure is to be derived.  If you want an uncomplicated adaptation of Austen that focuses on the love story to the exclusion of all other concerns, I recommend the Gwyneth version of ""Emma""    at least that movie is occasionally humorous.I'm finding it hard to find things to say about this production.  It was over in about and hour and a half.  All background, characterization, and nuance were thrown overboard in order to connect the dots on the map in the most single minded and simple minded manner that would arrive at the final destination.  The heroine, as played by Billie Piper, bears not the slightest resemblance to the uptight stick in the mud Fanny Price from the novel.  (Well, okay, perhaps that's an improvement.)  Piper plays Price as a coltish ingenue with her hair perpetually down.  And, from the looks of it, bleached.  Hip.Blake Ritson as Edmund is the only actor among the younger members of the cast who seems to be making any effort to play a recognizably Austenian character.  Generally speaking, the younger members of the cast act too ""modern"", particularly the young woman who plays Mary Crawford.  The older actors are hardly given any screen time, so I can't comment on their efforts.The fact that the entirety of the movie was shot on one location    some grand old pile or other in Yorkshire    says volumes about the cheapness of the production.

"I watched and enjoyed season 1 for a lot of the same reasons others did.  I expected more of the same this season.  I made it through three episodes and stopped.  It is a non stop series of scenes depicting humiliation, gratuitous cruelty and violence, outright torture, sadism, bondage and obedience, degrading and violent sexuality, simple ghoulishness, and on and on. I find nothing redeeming in this series. There is nothing in it I would call a plot or a narrative arc or character development.  Any more than there is in your average porno production.  Just a pretext for more ""torture porn.""There is no wit or humor or depth or insight, either.  It is just relentlessly and oppressively cruel.The fact that it has so many positive reviews tells me that it has found a cult following   not that it actually deserves positive reviews.I think the actors in this series are not only wasted. I think they are degrading themselves and damaging their reputations by participating in the project. I will never be able to watch Jessica Lang, James Cromwell, Evan Peters or any of the other actors without unfortunate flashbacks to this series.

"Grave Encounters 2 is a found footage film that follows Alex, an aspiring filmmaker; Alex, who recently posted a negative review for ""Grave Encounters"", begins to receive eerie messages that have him questioning the original film's authenticity. Alex eventually believes the film is real, and convinces his friends to travel with him to the Grave Encounters' shooting location, a mental hospital, to get proof. Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept, but lacks the essential horror elements (terror, suspense, atmosphere, etc.)The story in Grave Encounters 2 is interesting; I know this concept has been done before, but it's not something that's been overdone, so I was genuinely interested. The execution, however, was poor. The film uses the first 30 minutes or so to build up the mystery and introduce develop the characters. A horror film with build up and characters? Great! However, the build up mystery in this film is very dull since it lacks suspense and creepiness, and the characters aren't actually deep, despite spending a third of the film learning about them  we see the surface of the characters, and they're irritable and illogical. So, the first act of the film is basically useless backstory that could've been told more efficiently.The rest of the film takes place in the mental hospital. Again, the tension is absent throughout the film; this makes the jump scares ineffective, except for 1 or 2. Most of the film is the group walking into a room, seeing something paranormal and being chased out; running from room to room, you'd think you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo. I won't spoil the final third of the film, but it's actually somewhat decent; the explanation is twisted and somewhat unique; I'm sure there are a few hardcore Grave Encounter fans that will enjoy it. I'm not saying it's the greatest finale, but it adds to the dull atmosphere tone of this film. My final complaint for the movie overall: the poor use of an immensely creepy and haunting setting  the opportunity to build a dreadful atmosphere is completely missed, and the setting is basically ignored. The acting was mostly good, occasionally some of the dialogue would feel forced and there was some overacting.Overall, Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept and a decent final act. But, most of the film is uneventful, boring, and uninspired; the tension is absent, the jump scares are ineffective, and poorly uses, actually, completely forgets about it's setting. Barely enough to warrant 2 stars, I recommend a rental for horror fans. As of 2 23 13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming.Grave Encounters 2 has strong violence and blood.","Interesting Concept, But Lacks The Essential Horror Elements (Terror, Suspense, Atmosphere, etc.)...",1361664000,"02 24, 2013",2,-1

And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud! I just didn't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane, they fall in love way too quickly and I can't figure out why they do?

"Again, let me offer up this defense before I go any further: I'm not opposed to the whole `found footage' phenomenon.  As I've said, I think there's a spark of brilliance behind every one of these films.  If there's any fault to this entire movement, it's that too many stories that would be better served and received by being built as a regular feature (meaning NOT as a found footage vehicle) are, instead, being done on the fast and the cheap by taking this somewhat easy way out.  Still, if the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise teaches us anything, it's that ""if you build it, people will come"" ... so settle in for the long haul, society.  It looks like `found footage' is here to stay.(NOTE: The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final jazzessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)I didn't see the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS, so I'm only going on what I've been able to ascertain from some quick reading; but it looks like that 2011 flick tapped a vein: budgeted on a slick $1 million, it at least had legs strong enough to start a franchise, and it's second installment, GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2, even garnered the embellishment of the Tribeca Film series, so that's none too shabby.  While the first feature explored what happened when the production crew of a ghost hunting program actually ran afoul of real ghosts, the second tweaked the formula just a bit.Film student and horror enthusiast Alex Wright (played by Richard Harmon) believed that GRAVE ENCOUNTERS was a legitimate conspiracy released to audiences.  He contends that what happened in the ""film"" was actually a true story, but it was only ""marketed"" as a fictional film in order to get it before the mjazzes.  Out to prove his point, he enlists the aid of his fellow cljazzmates to scout out the real location of the original `encounters' so that they may probe the condemned psychiatric hospital for true spirits.  What he finds brings him face to face with some grim truths that might spell doom for those who joined him for such a personal haunting.This horror schlock is brought to you by the same team who did the first outing: the Vicious Brothers.  At a glance over on IMDB.com, it would appear this franchise is presently the only thing they have to their name, but, in their defense, there's enough charm, gore, and inspiration that I wouldn't be all that surprised to see more from them.  Granted, not every stone turned over here is all that original, but there's a pleasant enough mix of solid performances, predictable developments, and harmless scares that they're probably destined to do another one, at least, or launch some other screamer on unsuspecting audiences.What I didn't like was the blatant stupidity of so many of these characters.  Yes, I realize that a `working stupidity' kind of goes hand in hand with horror films.  But you would think that a group of young film nerds   ones who have made a college career out of mildly sending up the same genre with their own little pet projects   would know best what trips and traps to NOT fall into here.  Once they're deposited in the psychiatric hospital, all of what they knew before seems to vanish quicker than the first virgin (another horror film staple), and that's sad.  If they were so smart, why didn't they plan this all out better?  If they were so creative, why didn't they expect some of what awaited them?  If they truly believed everything in the first film was a legitimate spectral event, why wouldn't they have gone in better prepared than they did?I know, I know, I know.  It's a horror film, after all, and that's what suffices for a horror film in this day and age.  Put your brain on `pause' and you're liable to enjoy this one a bit more than I did.GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 is produced by Death Awaits Cinema, Twin Engine Films, and Pink Buffalo Films.  The film appeared as part of the Tribeca Film series.  DVD distribution is being handled by New Video.  As for the technical specifications, much of it looks and sounds solid, though there is some obvious distortion done deliberately due to the nature of the `found footage film' phenomenon; however, I didn't find any of it unusually distracting from the experience, though some muffled audio was tough to hear.  Sadly, there's only a single special feature; it's listed as ""An Interview with the Vicious Brothers,"" but it's essentially a 3 minute blurb about the film   I'm guessing it was almost what they said when they pitched this idea   and it's disappointing.RECOMMENDED only for fans of horror and or found footage films.  Outside of the basic storytelling premise   that the Vicious Brothers kinda sorta intended for this to be `respected' as a legitimate found footage flick   there's nothing new here.  As I've tried to be clear above, it's kinda sorta sad that the whole `found footage phenomenon' has come full circle to the point now where fully realized stories that may've been better served by not being filmed this way (as `found footage') are still being churned out by an industry that apparently never heard a bad idea.  I think GRAVE would've been better constructed as a traditional horror film   the very ones it thumbs its nose at   but maybe that's just me.  Odds are that, if `found footage' is your thing, you might enjoy this one more than I did.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with an advance DVD screener of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 for the expressed purpose of completing this review.","Some Sequels Are A GRAVE Idea, Indeed",1362009600,"02 28, 2013",2,-1
"Explanation For Lower Rating:I'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year, but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction.  When they released ""Pawn Stars: Volume Three,"" many people jazzumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety.  It was, in fact, only sixteen episodes.  When they released ""American Pickers: Volume Two,"" it was the same thing.  Season One had been released with all episodes, but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two.  I know some people that preordered sight unseen, or just weren't paying attention, felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had jazzumed were full season DVD releases.  Personally, I didn't agree with the decision  but, at least, the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included.  Anyone who read the box knew what to expect  how many episodes and which ones, so it wasn't a blind investment!Not so for ""American Restoration, Volume One!""  I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside.  Never mind that it doesn't list them (which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package)  it doesn't even tell you how many episodes you are getting.  I suppose I'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics?  I know this may seem trivial to some or that I'm overreacting, but I think the company owes potential buyers this information.  My lower rating, therefore, reflects the History Channel's (or A&E; Networks distributing) apparent disregard for its own fan base.  I don't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I'm paying for!I, however, will tell you what is inside.  The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes:  all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two.  Really, how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box?Season One: (1) Hopalong Rock, (2) Ice Cold, (3) Lights Out, and (4) Buttered Up.Season Two: (1) Cooler Kings, (2) Knockout, (3) Duck and Cover, (4)Pumped Up, (5) Space Kowboy, (6) Jackpot, (7) Safe Keeping, (8) Suck Up, (9) Rev'd Up, (10) Apples and X Rays, (11) Hot & Cold, and (12) Secret Fan.Actual Review:I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade.  ""American Restoration"" is an offshoot of the popular ""Pawn Stars,"" and fits comfortably into the History Channel's stable of reality based programming.  Its star (Rick Dale) made semi regular appearances on that program, but now we get a closer look at what he does.  Based in Las Vegas, Dale and team locate objects that might be of value (or represent lost bits of Americana) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory.  It's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows (Pawn Stars, Storage Wars and others).  I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form  and I do think Dale is an artist!  The program itself merits four stars.

"There are bad movies that make you angry. There are bad movies that make you laugh. And then... there are bad movies that make you feel a little depressed and icky, but mostly just bored.""The Canyons"" is the last kind    a hollow low budget melodrama that begins and ends with empty pretension. It has roughly the same kind of story (shallow rich people, sex, murder) that Bret Easton Ellis has been writing for the past several decades, centering on a rapidly deteriorating Lindsay Lohan and her smoker's croak.Rich brat movie producer Christian (James Deen) is in a relationship with Tara (Lohan), an aging party girl who desperately wants the financial security he gives her. Every night, Christian brings in other people (both male and female) to have sex with Tara while he watches, and sometimes they participate in group sex.Tara convinces Christian to cast struggling actor bartender Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk) in his latest schlock movie    without mentioning that Ryan is her ex boyfriend, and that she's having a secret affair with him. But Christian suspects what Tara and Ryan are up to    and he sets out to destroy his rival in any way possible. Even murder.Even before it was made, ""The Canyons"" was overshadowed by the forces behind it    it was written by Ellis, directed by Richard Schrade, and starred the perennial train wreck Lindsay Lohan in her ""comeback."" What was more, the movie was funded by Kickstarter and distributed on VOD. This movie could have been on the vanguard of the new wave of entertainment production...... but to do that, it would have to be good. And it's not. Instead it feels like Ellis is running on empty, so he's regurgitating pallid knockoffs of the shocking, controversial kind of stories that he's written about in his books. It's like a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox, and it just leaves me wondering why he was so desperate to make this movie.Bless Richard Schrader, he's trying to do SOMETHING with this mess, but doesn't seem to know what. The plot aimlessly wanders around, following Tara and Christian in their little cat and mouse game, having awkwardly unsexy sex and boring us into a stupor with the stilted, hackneyed dialogue. As the final indignity, they try to throw ""twists"" into it, but they are either nonsensical or predictable.So it's a bad movie. But it's not the hilariously awful, awkward train wreck that people wanted. It's too good to be hilarious like ""The Room,"" but too bad to be watchable.It's also kind of sad that the best performance (no double entendre intended) comes from a porn actor. Actually, James Deen is really, really good as Christian    a cold, dead eyed sociopath who has wells of white hot fury inside him. He loves no one, and sees everyone who isn't easily controllable (like Tara) as an obstacle.Sadly, Deen is the best actor here. Funk is painfully out of his depth here. And Lohan is effectively playing herself, though not very well    an aging, damaged party girl who lives off the largesse of rich men because she couldn't cut it as an actress. You can practically see her crumbling away in front of your eyes, with her ravaged face and croaking voice. It adds a poignancy to her performance that her affected acting sadly can't supply.""The Canyons"" is a movie that feels like a halfhearted effort from everyone involved, except the scarily empty eyed Deen.

"Looking at other people's reviews I'm clearly in a minority. After all, what could possibly be more wholesome than yet another TV series in which the good guys blast away at all & sundry with a never ending stream of Hollywood rounds (the sort that keep on coming long after the magazine is empty...)? Best of all, we don't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because   now this is the Really Good Part, honest   the victims are already dead! What could be better than that?? Needless to say the acting is average, the script is wooden, the plot is essentially non existent, and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.But, if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for, because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86% of the population is either fat or morbidly obese, everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles. Realistically this show ought to be about The Waddling Dead but here in TV land being a zombie means you're pretty darn lean. Not that it matters   gore is gore, blood is blood, and in the end they're all just targets. Remarkably, whereas in the real world people have to train extensively to manage head shots with any degree of consistency even against static targets, here even kids can make special forces style shots with total accuracy. No one ever gets hit by blue on blue, there's never a negligent discharge, and the concept of a ricochet is entirely alien.In other words it's basically boring repetitive mindless violence for the over two crowd.

"I think this is the lowest rating I've ever given a Robin Williams movie. Sorry, but I really did not like much of anything about it except Robin.Lance Clayton (Robin Williams) is a writer who has never been published, and an English teacher at the same school his douchebag of a son attends. The pejorative is Lance's, and it is deserved. Kyle (Daryl Sabara) is a spoiled, foul mouthed, scheming, brat who is obsessed with all sorts of sexual kinks, among them hanging himself while masturbating. I know there's a technical term for it, and I lost a friend to the thing. It's of course very dangerous, because one can accidentally kill himself.And that's exactly what Kyle did. His father walked in on him doing this almost hanging thing once, and was shocked, and told him how dangerous it was. Kyle blew off his father's advice just like he blew off everything his father said. But one day he did indeed accidentally kill himself.So Lance arranged the body as if it was a real suicide instead of an accidental one, and wrote a suicide note for Kyle, so that no one would have to know how perverted the kid was. Then one of the students (or was it one of the teachers?) discovered the suicide note in the police records and published it. They had all hated Kyle, but now it turns out he was a gifted writer and a tortured kid. He had only one friend, who was as much afraid of him as everyone else, was not doing well in school, disgusted all the girls, and had a serious case of the hots for his father's girlfriend, the art teacher (Alexie Gilmore).Inspired, Lance wrote an entire journal for Kyle, full of teenage angst, which Claire (the art teacher) encouraged him to publish. They did, and pjazzed it around the school, and made a sensation, and Lance was invited onto a TV show to talk about it, and . . .Oh, I'm giving too much away.

"The first season of ""The Outer Limits"" was the best. Sure the second season had some cljazzic episodes (among them ""Solider"" and ""Demon with a Gljazz Hand"" which inspired James Cameron to come up with ""The Terminator"". I'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue. Why? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time. They haven't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras. I'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Don't get me wrong  the first season was terrific for the most part. This set (like the first season set) features the moving ""The Man Who Was Never Born"" with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world. Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere (among his best), this was ""The Outer Limits"" as its best. Also we get ""The Galaxy Being"" with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti matter into ours causing destruction and death. David McCallum in ""The Sixth Finger"" about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how, in the process, we lose the essence of what makes us human.""The Zanti Misfits"" like much of Stefano's work provides a neat allegory about human nature. We also get ""The Borderlands"" and many other cljazzic episodes mixed with claptrap like ""Human Factor"" but almost everything here is terrific even if we're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on ""The Outer Limits""? Because MGM is convinced that you'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they've split them up. Heck, the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs. Nope. These are dual sided as well.So what do you get? 16 episodes  half the first season of the series. In August you can get the second half of the first season. I'm at a loss here  why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package? The only reason is so that retailers (such as Best Buy) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again. If you're going to do this at least give us some extras (a featurette on the visual effects, vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens, commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue.

"6 Souls used to be called Shelter but after hemorrhaging cash at the global box office the producers changed the name and foisted it off on the streaming crowd to see if we'd give it a second chance. Fortunately, I watched it on Netflix for free but there's little redeeming about this poorly paced, confusing mess of a plot.Julianne Moore and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are both excellent and struggle to keep the fun going as the screenplay slowly gives up the ghost and unfortunately for these guys they're in practically every single scene. The psychological claptrap quickly disappates to JRM showing us how many American accents he can do as he gets possessed evermore frequently, and somehow the ""scientists"" involved don't decide to call it quits and go home before something really bad happens.Something really bad does happen, of course, involving a random dartboard collection of a preacher, a crazy blind old woman witch doctor, skin breakouts that need urgent medical attention and bucketloads of exposition to fill in all the gaps. In darting between deciding what sort of story this is going to be, the audience gets thoroughly confused and the film treads a line where it never manages to be scary, interesting or gripping. Despite good performances from the two main characters, they can't save this one   skip unless you're very, very bored.",A confusing and derivative ride around films we've seen before,1374364800,"07 21, 2013",2,-1

"""The Oxford Murders"" is one of the most delightfully bad movies of our time. It's on par with ""Manos,Hands of Fate"",""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and ""Troll 2."" It has the pretentiousness of The Room combined with the campiness of any Wood (as in Ed) B movie. There are talented actors whose hamminess is redeeming John Hurt as the professor Arthur Seldom, Anna Mjazzey as a former Enigma codebreaker, and Alex Cox,the director of the superb Sid & Nancy as an obsessed mathematician who suffers hideously from cancer. Hurt saves the movie through overacting  then again,he did voice Aragorn in the Bakshi version of Lord of the Rings.The plot is obvious from the get go: A grad student, Martin (Elijah Wood) is immediately pounced on by two fangirls   I mean ladies   as soon as he arrives in Oxford. There are a series of mathematical murders,not to mention some hilarious dialogue:""I believe in the number pi!""""Beth is not an electron.""""Only this room,you... and the spaghetti."" This movie contains in the notorious spaghetti sex scene. The voluptuous nurse (the singer songwriter Leonor WatlingPapito) is making spaghetti wearing only an apron, and atop her, Martin slurps it off her bosom. Beth (Julie Cox,who pined for Paul Muad'Dib inFrank Herbert's Dune (Sci Fi TV Miniseries) (Special Edition Director's Cut) (3 Disc DVD Set)as Princess Irulan) pines for Martin. She doesn't want to be his friend,she wants aBad Romance   The RemixesThe plot is preposterous,and the movie has as much unintentional laughs as   most anything MST3K has tackled. It's a thriller horror that's been mislabeled. It's a comedy.While it's hilariously,uproariously bad,it gets 3 stars for these reasons 1)Great acting from Hurt (who's been in the great Quentin Crisp biopicAn Englishman in New York),Mjazzey. Even Julie Cox and Leonor Watling channel fangirlishness as they throw themselves at Elijah. They probably read the Frodo's Harem website to prepare themselves.2)The great Bach piece at the end. This movie needed more JS Bach,frankly. Beth's character plays annoying modern music.3)Elijah's frequently shirtless. Elijah spends most of the movie looking concerned,and widening his eyes. *SPOILER ALERT*The movie ends with him giving a blank,bland look. Thank goodness Elijah is frequently shirtless,even has a shower scene  to distract from his bland acting. In a touch of irony,there's a scene set at the Eagle and Child  the pub hangout of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis.""The Oxford Murders"" is so bad,it's good.

I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know it all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle cljazz, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle cljazz character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's cljazzy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly.

"First off, I've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades, and they've all had some things in common, and they've all had some differences. Most of them steal from the original (Bram Stoker) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources (such as Anne Rice) because vampire canon, such as it is, was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re invented imaginatively by Anne Rice. I loved, loved, LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer (the TV show, not the movie) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show, as was its spin off Angel.That said, I disagree with most reviewers who've said Moonlight is a rip off of Buffy or Angel. It is not. The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires, not the pantheon of jazzorted trolls, demons, and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated. Also, the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans    and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight, the short lived (3 seasons) CBS ""Crime Time After Prime Time"" early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto. Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight, in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the ""monster"" he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built in emotional tension for character and relationship development, plot devices, and historical flashbacks backstory. Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman, with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger, death, or some other terrible outcome (the human being ""turned"" vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath); thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other's lives (plot device), and only half heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same, er, species (living or undead) (also plot devices). And, like Nick Knight, Mick St. John prefers not to drink (eat) humans    but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood, Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood. Moonlight, in those respects, is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight. (After this point, there are SPOILERS, so you may want to stop reading now...)However, there are some clever differences: Forever Knight's big, bad sire vampire LaCroix, who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his ""gift"" of eternal life (and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor protege possessor possessed relationship) has been replaced by Coraline. Coraline is Mick St. John's ex wife and sire on Moonlight    an apparently evil female vampire who'd lived some 500 years, sired Mick (made him a vampire) on their wedding night (in 1952), and enmeshed him in an obsessive, addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually couldn't. He never wanted to be a vampire    he didn't even know she was one when they married. She made him a vampire against his will, without asking him or getting his permission. Now, of course, he has ""trust issues."" She, from her perspective, gave him a ""gift"" of eternal life    freedom from death (sounds familiar    like LaCroix on Forever Knight!).Coraline crossed a fatal line, however, when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little ""family"" (sounds familiar, eh? rather like Lestat, Louis, and Claudia in Anne Rice's Interview With The Vampire). Mick, by this time (1982), was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective (it is implied, though not directly stated, that he ""does good"" as a PI because he feels guilty about the ""bad"" he's done as a vampire). It was in this capacity that the girl's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth    only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes don't kill vampires, they just paralyze them. Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe. Mick, in his PI role in the first episode, finds the distraught mother's little girl, rescues her, stakes his crazy ex wife lover sire Coraline to paralyze her, and sets the place on fire before locking her in. The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family. Thus begins Mick's distant ""relationship"" with Beth Turner, who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire, a mostly online magazine that's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox's character Lucy edits on FX's show Dirt, except it's less celebrity focused and more local crime story sensationalism. Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight, ""No Such Thing as Vampires,"" Beth, now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions (but news whore tendencies), winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers. Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA (with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef, a 400 some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring, formerly on Veronica Mars).I didn't watch this episode on CBS. In fact, I didn't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all    I watched them on CBS' web site of full video, Innertube. I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin's eye candy good looks, I've always loved the vampire genre, and I dearly loved Jason Dohring's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars, so I knew I wanted to catch the show. But I wasn't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing. The first episode was as predicted: stilted dialogue, cliche ish plot devices, utterly predictable plot and twists.However, what keeps me watching the show are several things: (1) the show has a beautiful, SoCal corrupt clarity about it, a noir look that is dark, decadent, sexy, and shiny; (2) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he's on it because he's got screen presence and, despite the poor material, seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills, including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position language, which communicate volumes; (3) Jason Dohring, who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen, and plays his amoral, jaded vampire role to the hilt, practically eating up the scenery, and (4) Sophia Myles, who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight (in the first Underworld movie) and is herself not a bad piece of eye candy of the female persuasion, and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin. She also isn't your typical stick thin, anorexic looking TV actress; the girl's got a little meat on her bones. So, unlike many of the women on TV, she actually occasionally looks like a ""real"" woman. Finally, (5) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it's set in    LA    and the surface obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode, however, was straight out of B movie (or is that B TV) hell. I thought, ""Eh, that was was pretty; I'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better."" I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back, too. But I wasn't expecting much from the show based on the first episode. I figured it would be my guilty pleasure, something I'd watch as ""webisodes"" and not much else.Surprisingly, it's getting really good. This has a lot to do with improved writing, developing backstory, intersecting relationship triangles, and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick's ex wife and vampire sire Coraline. It's still eye candy, but I don't feel as guilty about watching it    and now I actually watch it on TV. I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox. I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this. But the most recent episodes (we're up to episode 9 now) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick, while also increasing the tension between Mick's happily amoral and happily non human friend Josef (Jason Dohring) and the unhappy, secretly self hating Mick, who longs for a cure for his vampirism, some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline (Shannyn Sossamon) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick ""went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster"" has only improved the show's ""grab"" factor. The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn, but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon. And there's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well. There are some very sexy (though still network TV permissible) scenes on later eps and I'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake: like Angel, Buffy    and Forever Knight before them, as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night    what makes Moonlight, and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires. It's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human, and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two (or three or four) evils, or when emotion overrules reason in our decision making. They're still vampire shows, and that will result in some people dismissing them outright    just as some people dismiss science fiction as not ""serious"" literature. But as Battlestar Galactica fans know, it's not the genre that defines the shows, it's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective, this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all, and neither is the second. But the show is coming along, it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode, ""No Such Thing As Vampires,"" and the second Moonlight episode, as the contrived set ups they are for the seven following (more entertaining and less contrived) episodes.","predictable, cliche-ish eye-candy that gets better in later eps",1195776000,"11 23, 2007",2,-1

"At the risk of tooting my own horn, I'm comfortable admitting that I'm far more forgiving of these ""found footage"" films than most reviewers.  I've no problem saying that I've enjoyed the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise, even find them modestly creative in their own way.  Also, that APOLLO 18 flick wasn't all that much a failure, certainly not so much as the critics would have you believe.  And, yeah, even THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT had some solid inspiration behind its formula to recreate an episode of `The Twilight Zone' on a very low budget.  And as much as I wanted to give AREA_407 kudos for bringing that unique `found footage' perspective into monster and or science fiction, I really wish someone would've showed these filmmakers how to use a tripod or a track mount for much of it.See, AREA_407   for all its strengths   I found very difficult to watch.  The camera's constant bobbing and weaving and shaking and climbing and arcing and dropping became nauseating by the second half.  At 90 minutes, that's a bit too long for the average viewer to stomach without a healthy dose of Dramamine to tide him over.  The chief problem   unlike some of the other forays into `found footage'   is that quite a bit of AREA_407 takes place at night, in very confined settings, and under the tightly focused spotlight beam on a video camera.  You don't have anything to look away at, to momentarily refocus your field of vision, and, as a result, you're forced to concentrate on a screen too intently for too long a time.After boarding a plane on New Year's Eve, two sisters begin videotaping their encounters with fellow pjazzengers.  It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that this plane is going down.  Once on the ground (and for reasons that really defy storytelling logic), the girls continue videotaping their continuing attempts to frustrate those bruised and bloodied around them by capturing it all on videotape.  And, once it becomes clear that they're being hunted one by one for what would appear to be dinner by some monster, they still maintain the presence of mind to keep videotaping it all, each and every painful second.  Now, I realize some could make the argument that the girls didn't know the video camera was on   that maybe they were only using it for the light   but the problem that they keep admitting to videotaping EVERYTHING debunks that argument.And that's what's a shame about AREA_407: I really WANTED to love it.  Not only does it have everything a good `found footage' flick should have, it's also composed of equal parts LOST (the TV show) and JURASSIC PARK and CLOVERFIELD.  These folks are trapped   in the dark   and there's a monster out there.  No, they don't quite know what it is, but they see it in fleeting shots of light, and, thus, they can confirm that it's big, it's scary, and it's hungry.  And it isn't going away!  It's an edge of your seat thrill much of the time ... but, creatively, it should've gone the way of `found footage' films like DISTRICT 9 did.  They should've used `found footage' for only the parts of the film that needed it; then, when it became a traditional monster movie, they should've laid the handi cam aside and used traditional film equipment.  They still could've preserved the `shock' ending by going back to `found footage,' and, in my estimation, they would've had a modest hit on their hands.  All of the right ingredients were here ... they just had them in incorrect amounts.AREA_407 was produced by Suzanne DeLaurentiis Productions and Cloud Nine Pictures.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  How does it look?  Well, I think I've covered that in pretty great detail, no?  How does it sound?  For the most part, I had no problem with the audio.  Sure, given the nature of the method the filmmakers decided to tell their story, there's some predictable and deliberate problems with it.  Sadly, there are no special features to speak of on the disc.  Shame on you, filmmakers.  Shame on you.RECOMMENDED with modest reservations.  I'm giving it a solid two and one half stars based on the finished product, but I do so not without warning.  As I've tried to make abundantly clear, this is one of them there ""found footage"" variety flicks.  If you're not into the herky jerky camerawork, then AREA_407 is probably not for you because the herky and the jerky are front and center throughout all of it.  Still, there's a great story here   with some truly great scares   all given respectable life through the magic of film.  When someone remakes this, let's hope they get it right.In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of AREA_407 by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",Two and One-Half Stars: AREA_407 Becomes A Clever Disaster In More Ways than One,1348617600,"09 26, 2012",2,-1

"This account of her life seems quite sanitized, almost like the Hollywood press releases of old; in the days when the studio painted their 'version' of a star.  There were certainly contradictory remarks made by different 'jazzociates' of Crawford, you were never sure if they were friend or foe.  Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood, but not a lot about her personal life.  Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother, and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher.  Did the abuse occur?  I think it did.

"The cast and the previews looked worth watching...I watched episode 1 and within the first sequence I knew what was going to happen and I knew who was the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Dermot Mulroney, who plays the bad guy, looks terrible... dirty and dingy and not watchable.The premise is stupid. I am to believe that a group of teenagers whose parents are the most powerful and influential in the country (including the president's son), ALL are on a bus... a &#34;normal&#34; field trip... WITH only two secret service vehicles following them and no other security to be found... AND no security ON the bus... AND a crazy ex FBI (or other 3 letter word agent) is on the bus with them. Seriously! First, isn't a secret service agent to be WITH the president's kid at ALL times, WITH him, by his side, ON the bus? Second, none of these other high powered people have security around their kids at all... and third, a field trip, a freaking field trip. Where the hell where they going? What field trip with 16 17 year olds? WHERE ARE THEY GOING?And... a secret service agent is suppose to lay down his life for the president and his family. They are NOT to be compromised. But oh... wait... if I buy into this premise, of course they are easily compromised.That premise within itself made me roll my eyes. Then it gets better... &#34;send the other vehicle ahead to secure the restaurant for lunch&#34; yeah, the one other secret service vehicle... WHAT?... oh, but wait.. it gets better... the other vehicle disappears then there is a road block... AND... let's get out of our vehicles and NOT secure the president's son and just see what's going on... WHAT?All of that in the first 15 minutes... I'm suppose to buy that... but oh...I find out that the show is going to be centered around a bunch of teenagers... ummm... no.Gillian Anderson, bless her heart... she looks good but that's about it. No emotion... none! And she did have a line for that something about... &#34;I'm not going to be this way for long&#34;... WHAT?oh... but wait... the bad guy, is of course, the BEST at what he does... which I guess is controlling everything thru his computer setup... and the FBI (or some other 3 letter agency) just fired him for something that he, of course, did not do, and let him go on his merry way.One positive note: The storyline with the new to the job secret service agent was pretty good. IF I watched the show again it would be to see how he saves the day, which is where it is seemingly headed. I was engaged with this part. I wanted to see what he would do to save the boy and himself.I didn't care about the rest of the story. I just wanted it to be over. However, the series could be saved. If I was writing it, I would get the teenagers rescued in the second episode so that little teen drama is over. Kill the supposed bad guy and find that he was actually working for someone else so there are is a &#34;real&#34; bad guy. And have a storyline in there of how the secret service and the FBI brewed up. But the remainder of the show would be the FBI against this new bad guy and of course, saving the day.Anyway, this is bad. I could probably pick apart every scene. The suspense is forced. The story itself should produce the suspense. Suspense is not just drawing out a situation, making us wait wait wait for an outcome that we know is coming.At the end of the episode the bottom line seemed to be... what would you do to protect your child?... Well, it didn't seem that any of those high powered parents did very much to protect their child by putting them on a bus for a field trip with no protection. So I guess the answer is... not so much... along with my rating.",Not so much... the premise is stupid,1396224000,"03 31, 2014",2,-1

"SPOILERS WARNING....J.J. Abrams has a huge slap coming from me. The reason is simple: I swore to my wife years ago that if I should ever discover an actual name behind the 'pioneering' camera shake, I'd slap him (or her). No one needs to see a film that looks like a frightened tourist's film of an erupting volcano while fleeing it.That is perhaps my biggest beef with this film. Abrams is shown in the mini documentary actually shaking and or slapping the camera as he is shooting key scenes. This, along with ""the glare"" (from stage lighting) is Abrams' big innovation. This camera quivering and vertigo inducing swooping is why I have wanted to slap him for so long.As to this film, let us speak as we find: this is not even a remake, much less a homage. It is a highjacking. Though the actors are flawless and talented beyond description for their performances here, it is en evil waste. By starting the film with a history shifting time traveler, Abrams has cheated everyone who sees this, everyone who retains the love of the original series.Having said that, it is a bloody brilliant move. The so called Star Trek ""franchise"" was at an apparent end. The TV series ""Enterprise"" had failed miserably; no one seemed to be in control of the intellectual property of Star Trek itself; fans felt a sort of dying era taking place right here, right now. This film saves us from that fate...or does it?In the distant future, an elderly Spock gets embroiled with angry Romulans since he apparently is responsible for their home planet (Romulus) being destroyed. A surviving faction of Romulans  especially nasty leader Nero  go flying backward in time, and Spock is forced along behind them. They appear 25 years before James T. Kirk is born, and they wait.Kirk's father is captain of a starship. The nasty Nero destroys the ship...and James T. Kirk's father. Here is the bloody marvel and the disgrace: this event has offered us a parallel universe reality, and from thence the film takes off, going boldly where I wished it hadn't. The elderly Spock is now on a mission to see that Nero is destroyed, which task can only fall to Kirk, of course. Meanwhile, the alternate reality trick goes stale rapidly. Vulcan, along with Spock's mother Amanda, is destroyed (and so is the screen time for Wynona Rider); Young Spock is entangled and enamored with Lt. Uhura; Chekov is a little faerie who is darned good at beaming people anywhere; Kirk himself is a rather gay looking idiot and part time drunkard; the rest of the clan is essentially ignored.Abrams and all involved are truly innovative and brilliant. But this film cannot pjazz without further comment. The ghosts of De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan will never rest now. Too many people still remember them with happiness and the pain at the loss of them. Yet here they are, along with the others, being mimicked or parodied or whatever one wishes to call it. I cannot fathom how Nimoy could agree to star in this, but he did. Who else could play ""Spock Prime"" as he is credited?My advice is that if you are a purist, don't see this. If you are a curious, adventurous and sacred cow kicking fan, see it. Don't miss it if you are a fan of lunk head director J.J. If you like cinema for its own sake, see it by all means. I for one felt a bit robbed by it all.

"There will be some people who instantly dismiss the low budget shocker ""Would You Rather"" based on its rather unpleasant conceit. Indeed, the movie was brutalized by most mainstream critics upon its release. It currently averages a dismal 20 out of 100 possible points on the review aggregate site Metacritic. Despite this fact, I was never deterred by its ghoulish premise. I embraced it and it was a major selling point! I'm not squeamish, I welcome an experience that will shock and disturb me. Truthfully, I didn't hate ""Would You Rather."" I did, however, feel that it fell far short of its potential. At 2 1 2 stars, I'm giving credit to one of the B movie greats. Jeffrey Combs (always the Re Animator in my heart) gives an unexpected and offbeat performance as a bored millionaire that uses real people in his sadistic entertainment. He made me laugh on occasion and his interactions with his staff and his son are quite funny (although to be fair, maybe some of these sequences are unintentionally amusing). The overall experience was so dire and monotonously downbeat, I welcomed each instance of levity. After all, aren't games supposed to be fun?Combs, as I mentioned, plays an unorthodox philanthropist who hosts exotic dinner parties. He scours the city for likely invitees and brings them together for one unforgettable night. Brittany Snow plays an enterprising, but struggling, young lady who has moved home to care for her terminally ill brother. Treatment is expensive and hope is thin. When Combs proposes a chance for her to win financial independence and stellar medical care, it is an offer she can't refuse. Upon arriving at his estate, she meets other equally needy attendees. As the evening progresses, Combs seems intent on pushing everyone to their limits. How much would it take for a diehard vegan to eat meat? A recovering alcoholic to get blotto? This is simply a teaser, though. When the game of Would You Rather begins, contestants are pitted against each other in a series of events that escalate in gruesomeness. Who will be the eventual winner and what will winning cost?Absolutely terrific idea, right? For the movie to truly succeed for me, though, I needed one of two things. Either I really had to care about the characters or the competition had to be far more imaginative and fun. Snow is fine, if a bit drab. While she is supposed to be our moral center, I found myself rooting for Sasha Grey (as no nonsense Amy) instead. Combs is a joy to watch, but the game lacked something overall. I won't spoil the individual surprises, but the realm of torture porn cinema has really raised the stakes in films of this kind. This is brutal and unpleasant, but surprisingly toothless as well. Touted, I suppose, as psychological horror  there isn't undue gore. But again, the characters didn't give me a lot to care about. Add the unnecessary and poorly developed subplot about the doctor, the intriguing father son dynamic that is forgotten when necessary, and an ending telegraphed a mile away and I wanted to like ""Would You Rather"" much more than I did. I guess I'm officially jaded. This didn't really shock me, but its relentlessness did depress me.

"Variation on a theme in TVland and cinema: those who stand accused are subject responsible to social indictment from society; people never change their substance (""DNA""); the ""bad"" people belong behind bars or deserve to be killed.In No Good Deed (Episode #9), Neal recognizes that Peter is closed to him as anything more than a criminal. [The same as what the psychiatrist said to Neal.] Over the past 4 seasons, Peter takes every opportunity to remind Neal of his flawed character, usually jokingly, yet consistently labelling Neal as deficient, deviant ""criminal"" from the appropriate norm that Peter upholds as an FBI agent: Peter is better than Neal will ever be ... as a human being.Another show, A.L.I.A.S. showed the same moral indignation toward the character Sloane from Sydney Bristow.  Likewise, in The Aviator, Howard Hughes (Leonardo di Caprio) falls prey to the constant bullying from his airline rival (played by Alex Baldwin) despite his wealth and social stature.Is this constant theme giving us license to judge others or encouraging to accept intimidation and bullying as the nature of human interaction, our superiority complex?  I will wait the end of the season to find out where the writers think this leads.Not only is the Peter Neal relationship at risk, the wife has on several occasions shown discontent with Peter's FBI career and ways.

"First, Eliza Dushku is not, by any standards, a very good actress (although gorgeous). Her appearances in the Buffy and Angel universe, playing a great character (Fatih), was always a little bit embarjazzing when she was confronted with the better actors around her (Sarah Michelle, Boreanaz, James Masters, Anthony Stewart Head, Alyson Hannigan).Then, the show itself. Whedon fans will think everything he does is marvellous. But simply it is not. In this first season, there are some episodes that border on unwatchable (my favorite ""worst"" is episode number 7, ""Echoes"". Its 49 minutes seemes like two hours). The concept of the show itself is strange: basically, all characters are despicable. Even Echo's handler is evil. Why? Because everyone in his right mine must be intrinsically evil to work in a comapny like the Dollhouse. Heck, the Dollhouse business makes even Wolfram & Hart seem like children playing...The genius guy, Topher, the handlers, Adelle (who coldly puts people in the Attic), everybody is obnoxious just for working for that kind of corporation. And that's exactly what FBI agent Paul Ballard, theoretically the strongest moral person of the show, believes but, tcham tcham tcham!!

"I was skeptical going into this movie. Nothing really good can come out of Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere when they want to ""denounce"" corporate greed. Everything was clich&eacute; in this movie. Down to the donation of 2 millions to a cancer research foundation, that will be used to make the doctors more rich and famous for nothing. They will use the funds to have ""meetings"" in exotic places in order to ""share the information"" (I haven't seen a scientific meeting downtown Detroit in a while). They will use the money to have big dinners and share big awards between them and patting themselves on the back. No drug that will cure a real disease will ever come out from these big donations and galas. In spite of this, people still believe that they are doing the right thing by donating money to these foundations. What a waste!The plot is somehow complicated and we are not getting a real answer because the movie just ends!  Robert Miller (Gere) is a hedge fund magnate (immediately you think he is the bad evil guy who deserves to die!) who has manipulated the books because of a bad investment (where else, in Russia) that cost him 420 millions. He wants to unload his company for approximately the same amount of money to replace the money before somebody checks the books (I guess he thinks that somebody who spends this kind of money, will not check the books first for accuracy,...but that is another story). One night while driving with his mistress he falls asleep and gets into an accident. She dies and he tries to cover up.Taking lessons of ethics and behavior in life from Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon it is quite amazing. I knew immediately even before the movie started that their goal was to denounce corporate greed and arrogant behavior. They didn't succeed in their goal since his mistress is not portrayed as a great person and we don't know much about her, just that she is of French origin. His wife is a cold selfish person that nobody should care about, and he is not greedy, he is just trying to cover for a mistake. They didn't want to make a real thriller or a mystery movie. They could have taken that route. That would have been a much better film. But they decided to make a (bad) propaganda movie. Just another complaint about people with money.  But wait: aren't they also arrogant millionaires that give their money to hedge fund managers to make more money? And when I watched the extras I saw a patronizing Sarandon and a serious Gere lecturing us about the problems of the world and what is ethical or not.  What a bunch of pretentious hypocrites!Richard Gere performance is the same as in ""Pretty Woman"" or ""an Officer and a Gentleman"". Average, nothing special. When I heard rumors of him going for the Oscars this year against Daniel Day Lewis in ""Lincoln"" it made me vomit. This film was already nominated for the Golden Globe which is a prelude to the Oscars. The only reason they will give him an award for this pathetic performance in this pathetic movie, is because everything is rigged in Hollywood and they want to promote their anti Wall Street propaganda. Really don't understand why the Hollywood people will bite the hand that feeds them. I don't think that the average Joe buys their propaganda: ""white collar corruption"", ""corporate greed"", ""fair share...fair share""...blah, blah, blah. These are clich&eacute; sentences that only minimum educated people (...like the occupy Wall Street moronic crowd) believe. This is totally illogical. Nothing in this film deserves even the mention of an award. And please people, get Susan Sarandon some decent clothes. She was dressed with rags like a homeless person throughout the movie. In contrast, Brit Marling was very cljazzy (we can tell that she already worked on Wall Street) but Susan Sarandon...was really very casual (to say the least) for a hedge fund magnate wife.The only bright moments in this movie are the performances of Jimmy (Nate Parker) and of Detective Bryar (Tim Roth). Great acting and really great presence. But still, trying to manipulate a picture and make up a poorly pixilated license plate was really cheap and sad. Anybody can do much better these days with a computer!Two stars only for Nate Parker's performance that really saves the film from the abyss where it really belongs together with the entire pathetic script.",Just terrible!

"Do you remember &#34;Lost&#34;? How it built up a complicated web of secrets, hints and mysteries... and eventually, we found out the creators had NO plan in place, and were just making it up as they went along, leaving huge swathes of the story unexplained?In a sense, &#34;Helix&#34; is the heir to &#34;Lost's&#34; throne. This series feels like it has been made up with no particular plan in mind, and with half a dozen genres that it bounces between like a Ping Pong ball    we have rage zombies, realistic epidemiology, sci fi diseases, lots of soap opera backstabbing, and villains who pop in and out of the story whenever things threaten to get boring.Dr. Alan Farragut (Billy Campbell) and his team    including his ex wife Dr Julia Walker (Kyra Zagorsky) and his adoring student Dr. Sarah Jordan (Jordan Hayes)    are dispatched to an arctic research base to investigate a potentially deadly outbreak. But Farragut's real reason for going is that his brother Peter (Neil Napier) has been infected with a weird virus that makes you ooze black goo. Peter also broke up Alan's marriage by sleeping with Julia... which makes the whole thing less awkward than you would expect.It's immediately obvious that Dr. Hiroshi Hatake (Hiroyuki Sanada) is hiding something about this bizarre new disease, especially since the infected people show bizarre new powers. And after Julia is infected    but somehow does not turn into a rage zombie    Alan begins to uncover a horrifying conspiracy linked with the completely and utterly evil Ilaria Corporation (corporations are always completely evil in bad horror!) which could wipe out the entire world.At times, &#34;Helix&#34; is like watching a soap opera    we have sexual affairs (past and present), a fatal brain tumor, kidnapped children, secret parents, long lost family, cold blooded murder, redeeming love, tragic backstory involving alcoholism, and other hackneyed plot elements that just fill up space. Nobody is here to see Alan and Julia awkwardly talking about why she slept with his brother    we want rage zombies vomiting tar into people's mouths.But admittedly, the first few episodes of the show have promise. There are a few interesting characters (Dr. Boyle, a chubby quirky mortician) and a series of hints that all is not as it seems (Hatake's glowing blue eyes). Consider the chilling image of frozen, screaming monkeys lodged in the ice outside. But then Boyle is killed, and we're left with a cast mostly made up of stiff, thin lipped, expressionless white people whom we have little reason to like. It's like watching a Twilight movie.But as the thirteen episodes wind on, it becomes painfully obvious that there was little planning    or if there was planning, then they bungled the delivery. The disease seems to change from episode to episode, depending on what the writers want, as do its effects. The infected people themselves just sort of... vanish whenever they're not convenient to the story. And whenever things get too boring, some villainous corporate types will show up to gorily kill people at random, and then be awkwardly and abruptly dispatched. And there's a weird subplot about one of Hatake's underlings spending time with the long lost family of ANOTHER underling, and... it's all very dull and ultimately unnecessary.And when the writers finally vomit out an explanation for what's going on, it's too little too late    large chunks of the conspiracy were never really properly explained. It feels like the creators    including Ronald D. Moore    just threw in everything they thought would be cool, and then patched it together later into a hasty, unsatisfying explanation.The saving grace of this show is respected Japanese actor Hiroyuki Sanada. While his accent occasionally makes it hard to tell what he's saying, Sanada shines like a lighthouse in the middle of all the more mediocre performances    in his hands, Hatake is a conflicted and complicated character, doing terrible things but also stopping the far more terrible menace to humanity.&#34;Helix Season 1&#34; is a big goopy tar colored mess    it's hard to believe that this was produced by the same guy who gave us &#34;Battlestar Galactica.&#34; Perhaps the second season will be an improvement.","Spinning ""Helix""",1401494400,"05 31, 2014",2,-1

"I loved, loved loved the previews and could not WAIT for this show.First thing you will notice is that the lead has a dumpy feel to him. He's pudgy. The girl looks dead most of the time...lifeless eyes. I know we are supposed to get that she dislikes this job, but somehow I think that is a luxury she can ill afford. She is brand new and she needs him.It is also unbelievable that she would talk back to her boss the way she does. The characters are just poorly developed.The writing is not there. Obviously, she is this criminal's daughter. Obviously. The plots are hard to follow and wobble upon a heavy amount of violence. All of that bloody encounter with her husband and then the cutting off of the hand in the last episode... just disgusting. I jazzume NBC would like to keep a few women in the audience...and we are leaving.I do like that we are unsure about her husband...that is a good mystery.The saving grace about the show is the internal FBI details as well as the premise. But it is never clear from the writing how he is aware of the criminal activity. You have to make the show believable.Here is another example of poor plotting, poor characterization. The lead obviously wants to spend time with the girl. The dinner was the perfect time to do that. But for no apparent reason, he bolts and runs in the middle of the dinner. I know the point is to add some action, but it just seems to me that it should happen at the end of the dinner.I am completely disppointed. It would be nice if the producers would watch The Good Wife and see how beautifully and richly the characters are drawn.I am adding some thoughts because I want to love this show:Punch it up with a new hot  criminal...with a 007 feel to him. A hot sexy guy. The pudgy guy could compete with him, mentor him, or just plain disappear. Punch it up more with a sexy female opposite 007 who has some edge to her...think patty nyholm on The Good Wife...what a great, smart character. But a sexier patty. That would definitely juice up the show. And get writers..good ones. Ones that understand character, can write a good plot, and can throw in some humor. And drop the violence...jazzuming you want women viewers. Come on...you can do it!

While ""District 9"" was original at the time I did not like it at all.  This one I thought was worse.  Its hard for me to find anything good to say about it, so I'll make this review short.  The effects were good, and it was another good idea for a movie.  But the main problem with the movie for me is that it's sooooooo drawn out.  If you took all the action out of ""Cloverfield"" you would have this movie.  I had to struggle to get through it.  Very boring.  I didn't enjoy it at all.  I give it a D .Would I watch again?   Not even if real aliens invaded and this was the only way to avoid them!!","Aliens invade Earth and 2 people try to make it to a safe zone.  This was not good times.  Drawn out, lame & boring.

"I wanted to like this film, we don't always get what we want. The cinematography was just so poor, under lit to the point I couldn't see who was talking or what was happening. Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here. Then there is the audio, it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool. Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while, especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand. I was beginning to wish for subtitles. So much for the technicalities. The direction was just as poor. the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly, painfully. I really don't care to see another scene in another film where our hero  character announces ""I'm an alcoholic"" at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze  straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity! Can you say cliche! The comic relief was..oh that's right there was none. I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there isn't one in this film. The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending. The woman playing Ondine, Alicja Bachleda, was sublime throughout. She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels. Colin was flat, a character without energy or dimension. I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel. Two stars, one for Alicja and one for what might have been.",Something Fishy,1404000000,"06 29, 2014",2,-1
